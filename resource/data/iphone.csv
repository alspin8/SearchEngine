5	Evil Never Sleeps: When Wireless Malware Stays On After Turning Off iPhones	Jiska Classen	2022-05-12 14:29:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06114v1	When an iPhone is turned off, most wireless chips stay on. For instance, upon user-initiated shutdown, the iPhone remains locatable via the Find My network. If the battery runs low, the iPhone shuts down automatically and enters a power reserve mode. Yet, users can still access credit cards, student passes, and other items in their Wallet. We analyze how Apple implements these standalone wireless features, working while iOS is not running, and determine their security boundaries. On recent iPhones, Bluetooth, Near Field Communication (NFC), and Ultra-wideband (UWB) keep running after power off, and all three wireless chips have direct access to the secure element. As a practical example what this means to security, we demonstrate the possibility to load malware onto a Bluetooth chip that is executed while the iPhone is off.			arxiv	['Alexander Heinrich', 'Robert Reith', 'Matthias Hollick']	0.0
6	The bumpy road towards iPhone 5c NAND mirroring	Sergei Skorobogatov	2016-09-14 16:01:19	http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04327v1	This paper is a short summary of a real world mirroring attack on the Apple iPhone 5c passcode retry counter under iOS 9. This was achieved by desoldering the NAND Flash chip of a sample phone in order to physically access its connection to the SoC and partially reverse engineering its proprietary bus protocol. The process does not require any expensive and sophisticated equipment. All needed parts are low cost and were obtained from local electronics distributors. By using the described and successful hardware mirroring process it was possible to bypass the limit on passcode retry attempts. This is the first public demonstration of the working prototype and the real hardware mirroring process for iPhone 5c. Although the process can be improved, it is still a successful proof-of-concept project. Knowledge of the possibility of mirroring will definitely help in designing systems with better protection. Also some reliability issues related to the NAND memory allocation in iPhone 5c are revealed. Some future research directions are outlined in this paper and several possible countermeasures are suggested. We show that claims that iPhone 5c NAND mirroring was infeasible were ill-advised.			arxiv	[]	1.0
7	Identification of Direct Socio-Geographical Price Discrimination: An Empirical Study on iPhones	Davidson Cheng	2022-01-19 23:01:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07903v1	Price discrimination is a practice where firms utilize varying sensitivities to prices among consumers to increase profits. The welfare effects of price discrimination are not agreed on among economists, but identification of such actions may contribute to our standing of firms' pricing behaviors. In this letter, I use econometric tools to analyze whether Apple Inc, one of the largest companies in the globe, is practicing price discrimination on the basis of socio-economical and geographical factors. My results indicate that iPhones are significantly (p $<$ 0.01) more expensive in markets where competitions are weak or where Apple has a strong market presence. Furthermore, iPhone prices are likely to increase (p $<$ 0.01) in developing countries/regions or markets with high income inequality.			arxiv	[]	2.0
8	Fast, Dense Feature SDM on an iPhone	Ashton Fagg	2016-12-16 01:47:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05332v1	In this paper, we present our method for enabling dense SDM to run at over 90 FPS on a mobile device. Our contributions are two-fold. Drawing inspiration from the FFT, we propose a Sparse Compositional Regression (SCR) framework, which enables a significant speed up over classical dense regressors. Second, we propose a binary approximation to SIFT features. Binary Approximated SIFT (BASIFT) features, which are a computationally efficient approximation to SIFT, a commonly used feature with SDM. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on an iPhone 7, and show that we achieve similar accuracy to SDM.			arxiv	['Simon Lucey', 'Sridha Sridharan']	3.0

16	Compact CNN Models for On-device Ocular-based User Recognition in Mobile Devices	Ali Almadan	2021-10-11 01:23:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04953v1	A number of studies have demonstrated the efficacy of deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) models for ocular-based user recognition in mobile devices. However, these high-performing networks have enormous space and computational complexity due to the millions of parameters and computations involved. These requirements make the deployment of deep learning models to resource-constrained mobile devices challenging. To this end, only a handful of studies based on knowledge distillation and patch-based models have been proposed to obtain compact size CNN models for ocular recognition in the mobile environment. In order to further advance the state-of-the-art, this study for the first time evaluates five neural network pruning methods and compares them with the knowledge distillation method for on-device CNN inference and mobile user verification using ocular images. Subject-independent analysis on VISOB and UPFR-Periocular datasets suggest the efficacy of layerwise magnitude-based pruning at a compression rate of 8 for mobile ocular-based authentication using ResNet50 as the base model. Further, comparison with the knowledge distillation suggests the efficacy of knowledge distillation over pruning methods in terms of verification accuracy and the real-time inference measured as deep feature extraction time on five mobile devices, namely, iPhone 6, iPhone X, iPhone XR, iPad Air 2 and iPad 7th Generation.			arxiv	['Ajita Rattani']	5.0

18	Computer vision system to count crustacean larvae	Chen Rothschild	2022-09-13 09:18:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05834v1	Fish products account for about 16 percent of the human diet worldwide, as of 2017. The counting action is a significant component in growing and producing these products. Growers must count the fish accurately, to do so technological solutions are needed. Two computer vision systems to automatically count crustacean larvae grown in industrial ponds were developed. The first system included an iPhone 11 camera with 3024X4032 resolution which acquired images from an industrial pond in indoor conditions. Two experiments were performed with this system, the first one included 200 images acquired in one day on growth stages 9,10 with an iPhone 11 camera on specific illumination condition. In the second experiment, a larvae industrial pond was photographed for 11 days with two devices an iPhone 11 and a SONY DSCHX90V cameras. With the first device (iPhone 11) two illumination conditions were tested. In each condition, 110 images were acquired. That system resulted in an accuracy of 88.4 percent image detection. The second system included a DSLR Nikon D510 camera with a 2000X2000 resolution with which seven experiments were performed outside the industrial pond. Images were acquired on day 1 of larvae growing stage resulting in the acquisition of a total of 700 images. That system resulted in an accuracy of 86 percent for a density of 50. An algorithm that automatically counts the number of larvae was developed for both cases based on the YOLOv5 CNN model. In addition, in this study, a larvae growth function was developed. Daily, several larvae were taken manually from the industrial pond and analyzed under a microscope. Once the growth stage was determined, images of the larva were acquired. Each larva's length was measured manually from the images. The most suitable model was the Gompertz model with a goodness of fit index of R squared of 0.983.			arxiv	[]	7.0
19	How Far Can Client-Only Solutions Go for Mobile Browser Speed?	Zhen Wang	2011-12-15 23:50:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.3691v1	Mobile browser is known to be slow because of the bottleneck in resource loading. Client-only solutions to improve resource loading are attractive because they are immediately deployable, scalable, and secure. We present the first publicly known treatment of client-only solutions to understand how much they can improve mobile browser speed without infrastructure support. Leveraging an unprecedented set of web usage data collected from 24 iPhone users continuously over one year, we examine the three fundamental, orthogonal approaches a client-only solution can take: caching, prefetching, and speculative loading, which is first proposed and studied in this work. Speculative loading predicts and speculatively loads the subresources needed to open a web page once its URL is given. We show that while caching and prefetching are highly limited for mobile browsing, speculative loading can be significantly more effective. Empirically, we show that client-only solutions can improve the browser speed by about 1.4 second on average for web sites visited by the 24 iPhone users. We also report the design, realization, and evaluation of speculative loading in a WebKit-based browser called Tempo. On average, Tempo can reduce browser delay by 1 second (~20%).			arxiv	['Felix Xiaozhu Lin', 'Lin Zhong', 'Mansoor Chishtie']	8.0

26	Supervised Opinion Aspect Extraction by Exploiting Past Extraction Results	Lei Shu	2016-12-23 11:32:37	http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07940v1	"One of the key tasks of sentiment analysis of product reviews is to extract product aspects or features that users have expressed opinions on. In this work, we focus on using supervised sequence labeling as the base approach to performing the task. Although several extraction methods using sequence labeling methods such as Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) have been proposed, we show that this supervised approach can be significantly improved by exploiting the idea of concept sharing across multiple domains. For example, ""screen"" is an aspect in iPhone, but not only iPhone has a screen, many electronic devices have screens too. When ""screen"" appears in a review of a new domain (or product), it is likely to be an aspect too. Knowing this information enables us to do much better extraction in the new domain. This paper proposes a novel extraction method exploiting this idea in the context of supervised sequence labeling. Experimental results show that it produces markedly better results than without using the past information."			arxiv	['Bing Liu', 'Hu Xu', 'Annice Kim']	9.0
27	Real World Longitudinal iOS App Usage Study at Scale	Dohyun Kim	2019-12-28 21:42:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12526v1	Given the importance of understanding the interaction between mobile devices and their users, app usage patterns have been studied in various contexts. However, prior work has not fully investigated longitudinal changes to app usage behavior. In this paper, we present a longitudinal, large-scale study of mobile app usage based on a dataset collected from 162,006 iPhones and iPads over 4 years. We explore multiple dimensions of app usage pattern proving useful insights on how app usage changes over time. Our key findings include (i) app usage pattern changes over time both at the individual app level and the app category level (i.e. proportion of time a user spends using an app), (ii) users keep a small set of apps frequently launched (90% of iPhone users launch roughly 14-18 apps weekly), (iii) a small number of apps remain popular while some specific kinds of apps (e.g. Games) have a shorter life cycle compared to other apps of different categories. Finally, we discuss our findings and their implications, for example, a short-term study as an attempt to understand the general needs of mobile devices may not achieve useful results for the long term.			arxiv	['Joshua Gluck', 'Malcolm Hall', 'Yuvraj Agarwal']	10.0
28	Performing with a Mobile Computer System for Vibraphone	Charles Martin	2020-12-01 04:57:25	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00265v1	This paper describes the development of an Apple iPhone based mobile computer system for vibraphone and its use in a series of the author's performance projects in 2011 and 2012. This artistic research was motivated by a desire to develop an alternative to laptop computers for the author's existing percussion and computer performance practice. The aims were to develop a light, compact and flexible system using mobile devices that would allow computer music to infiltrate solo and ensemble performance situations where it is difficult to use a laptop computer. The project began with a system that brought computer elements to Nordlig Vinter, a suite of percussion duos, using an iPhone, RjDj, Pure Data and a home-made pickup system. This process was documented with video recordings and analysed using ethnographic methods. The mobile computer music setup proved to be elegant and convenient in performance situations with very little time and space to set up, as well as in performance classes and workshops. The simple mobile system encouraged experimentation and the platforms used enabled sharing with a wider audience.			arxiv	[]	11.0

It is the second most popular website globally in 2021. People prefer to watch videos on recently released products prior to purchasing, in order to gather overall feedback and make worthy decisions. These videos are created by vloggers who are enthusiastic about technical materials and feedback is usually placed by experienced users of the product or its brand. Analyzing the sentiment of the user reviews gives useful insights into the product in general. This study is focused on three smartphone reviews, namely, Apple iPhone 13, Google Pixel 6, and Samsung Galaxy S21 which were released in 2021. VADER, which is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool was used to classify each comment to its appropriate positive or negative orientation. All three smartphones show a positive sentiment from the users' perspective and iPhone 13 has the highest number of positive reviews. The resulting models have been tested using N\""aive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine. Among these three classifiers, Support Vector Machine shows higher accuracies and F1-scores."			arxiv	[]	12.0
