1	HELP Offensive aspect of coaching.	Unknown	2024-01-10 18:01:53	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/193el5t/help_offensive_aspect_of_coaching/	I've coached for about 10 years. Football, rugby, and soccer. With there being no AAU team in our city, I was asked by tons of parents to start my own program. Defensively, I understand it's principles, assignments and rules for man vs zone, rotations etc. The offense is were I am a bit perplexed. I do understand I must first pick an offense to run from the likes of: Motion, Pick n Roll, Triangle, Dribble Drive, Zone, Pick n Roll, Read N React, ... etc How do I go about choosing what's best for our youth program?	0.0	t3_193el5t	reddit		
2	I feel like I’m being taken for granted by my teammates	Unknown	2024-01-09 20:25:48	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/192olr9/i_feel_like_im_being_taken_for_granted_by_my/	I am a middle school player and I am the big man on my team. I am one of the 2 6 feet players on my team and I always get put on the other for scrims. I am skinny and he is big, about 170 pounds but he moves fast for his size. Whenever I miss a block I get screamed at by a much worse player, our shooting guard who has not made a shot in 2 games, and it is the same when I don’t get a rebound. The small forward is always taking stupid congested shots and expects me to become prime Dennis Rodman and get the rebound to him, and when I don’t I am shunned and pushed away, but when I do I get no recognition or credit. I am not a good deep shooter (like a center ) but at midrange I can shoot pretty consistently. The problem is: I never get passed to in midrange OR under the basket. I make 90 percent of layups and when I miss, I get yelled at by outright shooting gaurd, who is, again, terrible. What should I change or do?	16.0	t3_192olr9	reddit

Unknown	2024-01-09 11:15:11	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/192ces9/what_type_of_players_are_most_annoying_to_share_a/	I've got three answers for this myself and I'm interested in hearing a lot of venting in the comments. My three are: 1. The pointless dribbler - the guy who just dances with the ball repeating moves he saw on 2k and not actually attacking. 2. Wannabe Kobe - the dude who thinks any shot HE takes is a good shot and anything anyone else does is shit. He'll settle for 10 mid range shots at 2/10 and call you out for being 2/5. 3. The lazy defender - these dudes are all hands on defense, if they play it at all. There will be no attempt to move their feet, and they'll probably throw a fit if you call them on it	49.0	t3_192ces9	reddit		
7	"Head Basketball Coach Marcus Thompson & Sanford School of Delaware: ""Be Careful When Choosing your child's High School Coach!"" - Learn from us."	Unknown	2024-01-09 23:03:41	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/192skkc/head_basketball_coach_marcus_thompson_sanford/	"My daughter was an 8th grade Varsity Basketball player at Ursuline Academy in the winter 2021. Like most youngsters while she was talented for her age she wasn't playing ahead of stronger upperclassmen that season. Enter ""Coach Thompson"", when seeing this opportunity, the recruitment to Sanford began. The recruitment texts, the promises of soon being a starter immediately, & the videos (See attached) of former top GPOY, and players reading pre written statements began. While we were naive that this violates DIAA recruiting rules, as a parent you cant help but get excited that a coach wants your child. To also give you some context if you're not from Delaware there really is 2 or 3 schools here with a good HS Girls Basketball team. So its slim pickings. What I know now is this coach saw an opening to badmouth a good players current situation and coach, and convince a child (and us) to leave a school she was at for 8 years. While in hindsight that was the first red flag, the next red flag was the WAVE of former players and parents whom warned us that this school and coach was just a nightmare. A nightmare so bad they never want to relive it. Unfortunately, while this is going on, you continue to be naive. You think so much of your own child, that you say ""they couldn't handle this"", or your child's situation will be different bc ""he is recruiting us"". From the FIRST moment we joined the team in Fall of 2021 there was absolutely ZERO communication with parents, and even less with his players. You think a coach will work with each child to help strengthen whats weak and even improve upon their already strengths. There was not one instance of this. In watching practices on HUDL you see kids are just doing their own things, some scrimmaging, and Coach Thompson is sitting in the stands, on his cell phone, most likely ""Tweeting"" about his former players/wins. The lack of development, and coaching itself became so evident. That same year, in the 2022 State Championship Finals he lost to a team we had beaten by 30 the week before. Losing simply because he was out-coached. The girls of course became emotional wrecks. Every night I had a child coming home from both games and practices crying. If she was upset during a game or practice, He called her a ""Spoiled Brat"" with an attitude. If she was happy, he told her she isn't serious enough for the team. You could see how much he was truly mentally abusing these players. Punishments for SAME infractions like missing a practice or run time were never equal. Players he liked would get no repercussion, or penalties, players he didn't like would be punished the sternest. This winter/early 2024 I had decided I had enough. I asked the former parents who would express their concerns, as well as my own, and listed them ALL by name. I had over 10 names of players who felt the situation at Sanford Girls Basketball was traumatizing. (Some Parents while saying they just want to move on, surprisingly mentioned that if ever in a trial/deposition, they couldn't deny the emotional harm of ""Coach Marcus Thompson"". I brought these emotional concerns to the attention of both the AD- Pat Jones, and School President- Mark Anderson. Instead of being told they would do their best to look into it and insure the environment was safe, and a positive one, I was told to get my child psychological treatment by the AD, and president told me, ""But we win"". (Side note, Pat Jones I found out was fired from, and even had a security escort out of the Tatnal School in Delaware, and was such a bad situation there is still an on going investigation) To me, hundreds of girls, students and players can come out of a situation with no issues. However once you find out 2, 4, TEN are saying there is an issue, would that then prompt action? I am a struggling father of a child who LOVES basketball. I have asked my child to learn that in both THIS and ANY situation, If a man or someone in a position of trust doesn't value her, she MUST value herself and walk away. However she is scared of the ramifications he has threatened her with. I am writing this in hopes of advice, learning if anyone else experienced this, and MOST IMPORTANTLY recommend any parent who is being recruited by this ""coach"" to learn from not just our mistake but that of MANY others. Others who are even the BEST who have recently played Girls Basketball in DELAWARE. STAY AWAY!"	1.0	t3_192skkc	reddit

15	If you had to train your younger self all over again, how would you coach yourself ?

It’s good cardio and I’d rather be shooting around than running on a treadmill. I’ve been practicing on my jump shot and in particular three point shot because as a kid I enjoyed practicing long range shots in my backyard. I just never had the fundamentals. I would say shooting is my biggest strength and I’ve been training on and off for the past fee months. Now I’m trying to do it consistently on a weekly basis. My favorite shots to practice are 3s, step back 3s and post fadeaway shots. I have been watching the Steph curry master class and working on form shooting from all over the court. My least favorite shot is corner 3s. I find them the most difficult to gauge because it feels 2 dimensional and flat and harder to gauge the distance. Also the slightly shorter distance throws me off. My biggest weakness is dribbling and I need to learn how to dribble without losing the ball lol. I also need to learn how to play defense better so I don’t keep fouling people lol. So I’m curious how would you train your younger self knowing everything you know now ? I’m more interested in practicing alone right now than playing against people because I don’t feel confident enough in my jumpshot in a real game until I’ve developed more muscle memory.	16.0	t3_1924iz7	reddit		
16	Double dribble/carrying question	Unknown	2024-01-09 18:27:10	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/192lmki/double_dribblecarrying_question/	Imagine a scenario where a player has a live dribble, and proceeds to do a half spin. During the spin move, the palm of the hand is roughly at an angle, not fully on the side, nor is it under the basketball. The basketball is now at a height similar to the player’s chest/torso. Player then releases the ball from his control, and then regains control of the ball with the same dribbling hand, with his palm on the top of the ball, at a slight angle. Again, no palm under the ball, not even partially. The player then continues to dribble the ball after that “exchange”. The ball has not drop/touched the ground during that short change of control, it was still hovering about the height of the player’s waist when he regained control. Will this count as a double dribble/carry in FIBA rules?	2.0	t3_192lmki	reddit

Unknown	2024-01-09 10:41:16	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/192bvxl/how_different_are_lamelo_and_lonzos_shots/	Was wondering why Lonzo had to redo his form whereas LaMelo is thriving with his. LaMelo's doesn't look as bad as Lonzo's rookie season shot form.. but it doesn't look as good as Lonzo's after his change with the Pelicans. LaMelo still seems to shoot from left to right. Whereas Lonzo has a straighter line on his shot path now. Melo is shooting 38% from 3 on high volume which is pretty good. I guess Melo is just a naturally better shooter than Lonzo and has really gotten comfortable with his unorthodox form?	2.0	t3_192bvxl	reddit

Unknown	2024-01-08 13:58:14	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/191lsth/there_isnt_an_age_limit_to_play_guys_come_on/	Alright, all the joke aside, basketball isn't just NBA. Basketball is a sport which you can start to play at any age, just meet a group of fellows and starts to play pick up games, you'll gradually start to get better at it, no matter how old or tall you are. Of course making basketball as a living is extremely difficult, I would say that the percentage of people who make it into major leagues is close to 0, but basketball can also be just a hobby, which is great actually when you dont have the pressure of performing in a higher level, just having fun with friends and making some buckets at a local park. I used to play when I was a teen at school and I decided to give it another try last year, 17 years later, and it has been amazing. Of course I dont want to play professionally (especially because I'm 32 years old, 5,4f tall lol) just by having fun with friends and losing some weight is more than enough to me. Fun fact: I also used to play with Raul Neto (he made into NBA and spent many years in the league, his last team was the Cavs), and back then there was a bunch of guys as talented as him (or even more talented). Of course Neto is a hell of a player, but his father was a well known player too, they know Varejão, Leandrinho and many others great players, so he was already in advantage in comparison to his peers, besides talent, he had connections, which is also really important if you want to be even considered to the draft. So relax guys, if you want to play basketball, just do it for fun, it's still worth it.	9.0	t3_191lsth	reddit

I’m very aware of how good these players are, I’ve played with amazing D1 players who got no where near the NBA. I’ve thought about this a lot and it seems very achievable yet it’s so unheard of that there must be something I’ve not thought about hence me asking on here. A bit about me, I’m 6’4 with a 6’6 wingspan, 32inch vertical and that’s largely untrained so there’s room for development. While these aren’t anything insane I definitely fit within the range for the body of an NBA point guard. I played basketball growing up and I dominate in rec leagues but I never took it too seriously as my love for the sport only recently developed into what it is. My thought process is if I spend the next 9 years of my life training as hard as I can, I’ll be 28, in my athletic prime with hopefully enough of a skillset to compete. It’s going to be a short career and obviously I won’t be a superstar but I’m failing to see how I won’t be able to compete with guys coming out of college with 9 years of elite training.	83.0	t3_191klu7	reddit

36	5th grade feeder team - playing time expectations	Unknown	2024-01-08 02:50:21	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/191ajk8/5th_grade_feeder_team_playing_time_expectations/	My kid is on a 5th grade team feeding into his HS program (school is 9-12 grade, 1,500 students). There are 160 playing minutes per game and 7 players on the team (meaning an even distribution of minutes would be ~23/player). He plays about 4-10 minutes per game, usually two three-minute runs per game, occasionally more if someone is in foul trouble. I’m trying to gauge whether to (and if so, how) to have a conversation with the coach about playing time. Compared to the other kids at his position (he plays the 2 or 3), he’s definitely the third best. He’s a good defender, plays smart, and takes decent shot selection. He is a competent dribbler and shot, but that’s probably where he has the most room to improve compared to the other two. With the lack of minutes, he is starting to play scared and he’s cold by the time he gets in. The other two are gassed by the end of the game and turning the ball over much more frequently. Anyway. I’m not under any illusions that he should be starting or getting some massive increase in minutes. But it’s not striking me as a fair rotation and has been frustrating. Am I off base? What’s a good way to approach the coach about it if that seems appropriate? Was thinking he could just ask how to get more time, potentially, but maybe we should say something instead? Thanks, appreciate the feedback.	2.0	t3_191ajk8	reddit

Unknown	2024-01-06 22:33:33	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/190c7ub/is_33_years_old_too_late_to_start_play/	I am a big basketball fan since many years, but never really played the game besides some practices and a few times in the neighborhood. Where I live (Berlin) there are many teams and a huge amount of leagues, but the rule seems to be to have some sort of experience: being an absolute beginner seems something which is not welcome at all. A couple teams were open to get me for a tryout even if I told them I was new to the game, but then they ended up telling me not to come anymore. Most practices I have joined were not really coached, so the assumption was simply that everyone already knew what to do. Even the beer league / hobby teams were pretty ambitious, and that discouraged me quite a bit, even if I understand that. I was then wondering if I should simply give up, or insist until I find a team/group where being 33 and a complete rookie is not a hurdle. I am 179 cm x 73 kg, have a strong background in field hockey and running, and am fairly fit. I just want to have fun and be able to play, without any sort of ambition or goal, but it seems to be kinda hard.	26.0	t3_190c7ub	reddit

The offence will have position close to the key and will push a defender with feet planted in position to get closer.

He loves playing with the ball and shooting hence the reason i signed him up. Last week at the first game he did great in the “practice” part but when the buzzer started going off every few mins or so all he would do is cover his ears, stare at the clock and wait for it..it terrified him so much that after a few times he started crying so came to me and his dad saying that he wants to leave, his dad basically forced him to stay there until the end of the game but he didn’t have to play. Today 2nd game, same thing….starts practicing everything good then at the second buzz started crying and came to me asking to leave. After a few mins i gave up and left…so my question is what can i do to help him to get over this fear as i feel he has potential and likes it.	2.0	t3_1908m1m	reddit

I'm quite an efficient scorer (probably the first option of my team when I'm on the court) but my mates feel that I'm kind of inconsistant and useless without the ball. Most of my baskets come from fast break transition or me driving into the paint after a couple of dribbles (where I can draw fouls or pass the ball to someone who's open if needed). It's a pretty exhausting style of play (I run a lot and go full contact with bigger opponent) and it often happens that once on half-court offense I'm too tired to be very useful unless I get the ball and try my luck at the rim (if I still get the fuel for that). Otherwise I'm not a real threat. My offball mouvements are weak, my shoot is clumsy, I'm not strong or tall enough to be on the post, and It's often an moment when I rest a bit after several high tempo plays. On defense I will never locked down my opponent full court. I'm smart enough to not be exposed on every single play but sometimes I can be kind of lazy because I know that if we get the ball my team except me to go full speed and get a bucket. I don't even shoot that much but I'm still afraid to be seen as a selfish/lazy player. You know that kind of streetballer that you don't want to see with the ball cause is a black hole and once he get it you will never see it again. To summarize : I'm not a system player, I'm the system... But I really want to help my team without being the main ball handler on every possession. Can you give me some advices or little tips to improve my offball skills without losing what's my strength on the court ? I guess working on my cardio will be an asset to hold the pace of the game and be more decisive half-court but I don't really get the time to practice more often. (Sorry for my english, I'm not a native English speaker) Edit : I guess some of you don't get the joke about ""being the system""... That was sarcasm. I'm obviously not the system, I just wanted to emphasize my difficulty in impacting the game other than by having the ball. Thank you all for your feedback and encouragement.

Unknown	2024-01-05 19:02:08	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/18zelfj/how_do_i_improve_offensively/	I am a 5'7 SG who is only good at defending, i can defend positions 1-4 id say i average around 3 stls and 2 blocks a game, i can also defend a 3v1 2v1 situation and coaches are getting fired up because of that but im still not satisfied because i cannot contribute in the offense. i really want to improve my scoring id say i average around 6-7ppg or sometimes 0. I always turn the ball over when i try to make a move but always hustle to recover my mistakes and end up getting the ball back which is great but i still get frustrated because of my dribbling and passing, my teammates would always yell at me when turning the ball over and dont always appreciate my hustle. I practice 3-4hrs everyday working on my dribbling and shooting but i just cant apply it in games any advice to make my points go higher?

Unknown	2024-01-05 23:27:46	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/18zkyt5/13u_at_this_age_is_playing_time_greater_than/	Son has been playing since 6.5 we've gone through a few programs. Currently he gets to play all he can for a local D1/D2 program at 13u and 14u. We tried a D1 travel program for 2 years before and he got limited playing time. Coming off the bench and having a short chain really destroyed his confidence and growth. The last 3 months of playing 3-5 games a weekend have really helped restore his confidence and growth in local tourneys against D2 competition and the occasional ass whooping by D1 programs. He was one of 2, 7th graders to make the Varsity middle school team and he played off the bench in middle school. Question is, do we continue with guaranteed playing time or go back to fighting for a starting role with a D1 program? I usually end up helping out as an assistant coach with whatever program I'm at, but leave the playing time decisions up to the head coach. The end goal is to make the JV team as a Freshmen in High school and starter for local HS by Sophomore year.	1.0	t3_18zkyt5	reddit

Beginning of the new year and i’m in kind of a crossroads situation here hoping for someone with more experience shed some light on it. QUESTION: Should I keep playing and just see where that goes, change the team etc but overall stick to the whole regimen OR just switch to a different sport which would fit my physique better and provide a long lasting endeavor assuming my athleticism would probably go further down the drain CONTEXT: 5”10, 200lbs, 29 yo I’ve started playing basketball pretty late, around 15-16 years old. I was never really physically gifted kid but I put in a ton of work to be a machine(my parents are below mediocre athletes) and it turned out pretty mjch as i expected. I played highschool basketball with allright results, then university with mediocre output as well. Then i stopped for a few years hitting pickup here and there(was traveling a lot during that period) Afterwards around mid 2019 I joined an amateur team that stemmed from my corporate job and tore an ACL during the game.Had surgery, all went well but covid etc made the comeback prolonged in time. I started playing again in the amateur league here in Europe around january 2022. Almost immediately i noticed that i declined in terms of athleticism and skillset. Worked my ass of to recover from that and now I’m playing on a decent level again but - THIS IS CRUCIAL - I feel like i wasted my time playing basketball. I met a friend on new year’s eve that i didn’t see for like 5 years and he told me to go pursue a different sport - with my physical shape and short height. I feel like i hit a ceiling in basketball due to my frame and i can’t really compete on a higher level without putting in 5x the work my other peers who are 6”3+ just don’t need to. I feel like my talents are better in other sports I currently go to the gym 3 times a week and are overall a decent athlete, really quick and strong - I was told I would make a good running back/wide receiver essentially I have a Tyreek Hill physique. I was also thinking about martial arts or sprinting (I used to do track n field in uni and this required a lot less pointless effort from my end simultaneously generating better results) I just feel like i will be further swimming upstream if i decide to play basketball through my 30. So i feel like w decision has to be made right now I’m aware this is a long post but hopefully somebody finds time to read through	0.0	t3_18z6rx5	reddit		
85	I fundamentally don't understand defense	Unknown	2024-01-04 18:21:54	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/18yjwqu/i_fundamentally_dont_understand_defense/	"I am so clueless when it comes to the philosophy behind defense in basketball. To clarify, I also haven't played organized basketball since Kindergarten, so I have basically no bbIQ and just enjoy the game as a hobby. For some reason, basketball defense just doesn't 'click' for me. Like, on a base level, I just don't understand the point of defense other than to distract and temporarily disrupt the flow of someone's offense. 1-on-1, what's to stop the offensive player from driving past their defender every single time? Like, I'm a big and clumsy person (5'11"", 215ish pounds) with absolutely zero bbIQ, but I'm also pretty quick, so I just get low and run past my defender like every single time because there's just nothing they can do. I already know where I'm going to put the ball, so I don't even notice the defense once I'm through unless there's a help defender. I play okay defense; people usually pass out or take contested shots, but if they were to drive, there is like nothing for me to do. I know this is what help defense is for, but even then, if the offensive player already knows where the ball is going, what does it matter if the defender goes up at the rim with them? Maybe the defense forces them to jump early? What makes a good defender anyway? Okay, they can read where the ball handler is trying to go, but what does that matter if the offense is going to drive by them anyway? How do you stop a layup? Do your best to stay in front of them? All they have to do is run into you and it's a blocking foul, right? Do you take your chances with an arm-bar? I know defense isn't pointless, especially at lower levels, I'm just having such a hard time understanding it on the most basic levels, especially perimeter defense. Please put the lightbulb above my head. Thank you."	21.0	t3_18yjwqu	reddit

I’m 23 female and basically I practice and I practice and alone or with friends at a court I play well. I look very boyish so about 50% of the time the people I play against think I’m a guy which is nice because they don’t end up going easy on me. I play smart too. I’m almost always not stronger, faster or can jump as high but I play defense very well at times when I’m disciplined and don’t do anything dumb. I also can score decently as well. But here’s the thing. I’ve been joining women leagues in my area because I prefer playing against other women just because it feels more fun I guess? Like I’m not trying go against buff 6ft guys lol. The problem is I am horrible. Every time it’s time for a game I get so scared for some reason. It’s like I don’t even want the ball at all. When I do get it I’m looking to pass asap. When I miss a layup or shot I’m in my head and can’t get out. Same thing happens when I’m on a court at a park without friends as well. It’s like I just don’t want to be there even though I do, I’m just so scared of playing bad. Does anyone have any advice or tips or anything to help me with this? I’m open to videos or whatever to help me develop a better mindset. Also if anyone out there was the same way and isn’t anymore can you please share what helped you get over it?

103	Making a basketball card game, and have a question for basketball fans… halves, quarters, or both?	Unknown	2024-01-03 12:09:34	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/18xhy03/making_a_basketball_card_game_and_have_a_question/	Hi, all! Came here because I have a question for basketball fans! So, I am wrapping up development of a simple basketball card game called Hardwood Duel. It is a two player game where you have a deck of cards that represent everything that happens in a basketball game… hitting shots, coaches calling out plays, crowds going nuts… and you go back and forth playing them until the end of the game. Whoever ends with the most points, wins. So it is basically done… at roughly 800 tests over two years, and people LOVE IT… *but I’m stuck on a very simple bit.* There are current two modes; a quick play simple ten turn mode (called Playground, although that might change to Pick Up) and the more advanced twenty turn mode, currently called Professional. But the game as it is currently built is played in two HALVES, which is more like college. SO, HERE IS THE QUESTION FOR BASKETBALL PLAYERS: Which looks best for you: A) leave it as is; having halves is fine, it’s just a game and doesn’t bother me. B) change it to quarters (it would still be the same number of turns).

104	The Pickleball Problem	Unknown	2024-01-03 01:27:58	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/18x6mvj/the_pickleball_problem/	In the past few years, pickleball (AKA Lazy Tennis) has grown as a sport, and is starting to encroach on our already limited basketball court space. The picklers will argue—“but our courts don’t take up as much space”—okay sure, but you only fit 4 players on a court. We fit anywhere from 10-18 players on a single court, depending on if you’re playing 5v5 or two half courts of 4v4. I’m pretty sure the space per player is almost the same. While we’re at it, how often do you see cities leave their public basketball courts in a state of disrepair? It’s not even a very expensive thing to maintain. Just get durable rims and backboards, and check the surface of the court from time to time. My current local park has a full court run 5 days a week—but us players have had to maintain the court ourselves! The city never responds to our maintenance requests, so we’ve had to bring out our own ladders, tools, and equipment to fix the backboard and replace the nets. What gives? Do other public sport courts get ignored in this way? To add to that, how often do basketball courts not have lights? Where I grew up, the basketball courts had lights that would shut off at 9pm, but the tennis courts adjacent to the basketball court would have lights on until 11pm! Tell me the city is racist without telling me the city is racist. So…what do we do to convince these municipalities that basketball is healthy and positive for the community? How do we get the proper investment in this sport? Are we just doomed to needing private funding for our sport?	13.0	t3_18x6mvj	reddit		
105	Inconsistent Nba players	Unknown	2024-01-03 21:56:07	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/18xvbqq/inconsistent_nba_players/	Is there an nba statistic that measures the inconsistency of players/stars? I know the eye/test is what most people use but I'd like to know if there is a measurement that measures the inconsistency to contribute to the team. Or a player who's stats vary the most from high to low. I'm not necessarily only talking about shooting percentages but overall contributions like assists/rebounds/turnovers, etc. Sorry if this is confusing. I'm not really sure how to put into words what I'm thinking. An example would be someone who sometimes puts up 26/6/5 and then sometimes puts up 6/0/1.	3.0	t3_18xvbqq	reddit

110	Future Changes to Basketball: Thoughts on a four-point arc and five-point zone?	Unknown	2024-01-03 23:46:08	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/18xy1u3/future_changes_to_basketball_thoughts_on_a/	"With the big three adding a four point ""spot"" to the game, and wrestling adding a new three-point take down rule. I think the future of our sports will inevitably change to add more dynamics to the game, and open up new strategies and ways to score or win. Instead of a designated ""spot"" like the big three has, what do you guys think about a four-point arc well beyond the three-point arc, and how about making it five points if you score from behind half-court? This will open up the back end, forcing players to make a decision on whether or not to advance forward to defend or give way and allow for a cushion. My reason for making this post is simply to enact change in the future. Someway, somehow, if we get people to start thinking and talking about this, my hope is that eventually it will resonate with some folks and in the end extend the lifeline of our sport. Because eventually, all the plays will be drawn out, all the moves done, and everything has been thought of and seen. Will the NBA or any other organizations make the change? I don't know nor do I think it will be soon nor should it be, just only after we've exhausted all our options and we begin to see a decline in viewership/participation. Maybe a change like this will impact who we see play the game. Perhaps with four and five point arcs/zones, we'll get a lot more participation from the shorter audiences, who will be bombing four and five point buckets with accuracy like Stephen Curry. Which in turn will have the defense move forward, and allow our smaller guys space in the back court for easy lay ups after the big (5) has moved up. IDK, just a spark of inspiration, hope it was entertaining to read."	10.0	t3_18xy1u3	reddit

Unknown	2024-01-02 20:11:03	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/18wyymt/whats_the_weirdest_play_style_you_have/	I usually play 3v3 basketball, and other than a pretty good pull up/stepback 3 point shot my game is inconsistent. I can't pass well, I can't get open, I can't catch the ball sometimes, but sometimes i can really embarass bigger opponents with a post hook. Even though I'm only 140 pounds i am quite wide, so i learned to use my shoulders to push people away, turn around and hit a hook shot or something resembling a fadeaway. Inside the paint area i can only score when i create contact so I'm always seeking for it. Otherwise my drives are very weak, i dont know when and which steps to make, and my floaters tend to be blocked wayy more often than a hook shot after creating separation with contact Not to mention the fact that its much much easier to catch the ball in the post position because you are actually facing the ball and shielding away the defender from catching it. So i think more small guys should look into developing their post game. Jalen Brunson, Russell Westbrook, Bradley Beal and i believe Jordan Clarkson are quite good in the post	13.0	t3_18wyymt	reddit

Any time that I’ve ever played, whether at a park or school it seems like the tall person is the one who does the best. I’ve seen tall kids dominate pickup games who weren’t even athletic. I know that in other sports it’s always beneficial to be taller but in basketball it seems especially so. The thing that’s always attracted me to American football is that players of different sizes can be successful. For example, a lot of running backs in the NFL are closer to average male height of 5’10. Corner backs especially those that play nickel can be close to that height too. Some QBs even have had success being shorter whether in the pros or college like Russell Wilson, Drew Brees and Bryce Young. Oline and Dline are big, I don’t mean height and they get paid the most out of every position besides QB. Theirs average height people on social media that dribble and shoot better than a lot of pro players. In another life maybe they are 6’8 and could play pro. They m don’t have the height and length to shoot over defenders or be able to defend other players themselves. I know there are exceptions like Muggsy Bogues but they are super rare. This is why basketball has always been kind of unappealing to me.	0.0	t3_18x7eov	reddit

That being said, I still want to practice, but don't have that much time to. I start school at 7:30 because of 0 period and get off at 3:30, and since I'm in an honors program I pretty much have homework every night, and by the time I finish it, I'm already drained and it's dark outside. Luckily, there's a park by my house that's only around a 5-minute walk. However, as I said, I kinda have social anxiety and since I suck I wouldn't want anyone else to be there while I practice. The solution to all these problems would just be to wake up early enough to go to the park before school when no one's there and I have enough time to get a good hour or hour and a half practice in. The only problem with that is, although I don't live in a necessarily bad area, the area where I live (and my city in general) kind of has a problem with homeless people, so I'm kinda scared to go out by myself that early in the morning. On top of that, there could be other people out and I don't really wanna get robbed or jumped or something. So I don't know what to do. Any advice is appreciated	10.0	t3_18wbm03	reddit

This wasn’t a surprise since the Cavs defense that year was ranked 2nd in the entire league and the Cavs had the 2nd best record in their conference (only 4 wins away from being 1st) because of their defense mainly. And this was at a time when lebron was not a defensive presence, he didn’t even make an all defensive team that year. Point is, the defense of the Cavs was good enough to take out the spurs biggest threat, now all that needed to be done was for the Cavs to capitalize on the opportunity. But, lebron choked. In the first game of the series lebron had 14 pts 7 rb 4 assists 1 steal 1 block with 6 turnovers with a 25% fg and 33% from the 3. This was a horrible performance for game 1 Lebron stepped his game up for the rest of the series in some statistical categories but he still had a horrible fg%, 3 point %, ft%, and averaged 5.8 turnovers per game. The final scores only had a difference of a single digit possession. The Cavs went through an easier conference, meaning they had less wear and tear going into the finals. Lebron didn’t need to perform exceptionally well. All lebron had to do was at least perform like he did in the regular season and he had the possibility of sweeping the spurs or at least winning in 6 or 7. There is no excuse for lebron here. Lebron had the advantage and he failed. We’ve seen other players have the advantage in the finals at a young age and succeed. Then we move into the 09-10 years. The Cavs had the best record in the nba in both years and was a top 3 point shooting and defensive team in both seasons. Lebron was growing his defensive presence but it still wasn’t elite, neither was his 3 point shooting. Lebron was a back to back mvp and was in the weaker conference. Lebron was not a young kid anymore like he was in 07. Lebron had no excuse for not making it to the finals these years. Since you already mentioned 2011 I won’t dissect that year. For the rest of the 2010’s, I just don’t see how lebron can get an excuse. 1. ⁠It doesn’t make sense to sympathize with lebron for 2014 when lebron is the one who decided to form a top heavy superteam in the first place, which inevitably came back to bite lebron when dwade declined. Also. A couple of those games only had a single digit possession difference. Most of the players were old and they had more wear and tear than the heat and lebron got locked down by kawhi, a guy who’s defense is similar to a Jordan or Kobe, two guys that many lebron fans and the media like to claim couldn’t lock down lebron. 2. ⁠His rivalry with the warriors doesn’t garner him sympathy either. Lebron formed a top heavy superteam with a 21/5/3 guy in kyrie and a 26/4/12 guy in Kevin love and the superteam was in the weaker conference yet again. Yet again, the majority of the games only had a single digit possession difference, lebron was affected by a defender that in theory isn’t supposed to have an affect on lebron, and his theory of a top heavy superteam came back to bite him. He doesn’t get an excuse for 2017-18 either. The warriors saw a superteam in the Cavs and recruited Kd to even the game. The difference in stats wasn’t large and was closer to even than it was to unfair in both years. No sympathy for lebron here. Also, for 2018 in particular, lebron self sabotaged himself. Lebron was going behind juries back to try to get him traded for Chris Paul and in return of finding this out, among other reasons, kyrie decided to leave, which left lebron with a team that was reliant on its top heavy players having a huge hole on the system. And the eastern conference was still weaker in this year as well.	2.0	t3_18vhpao	reddit

I grew up with a current NBA player who is very good, I used to be able to hang with d2/d3 players when it comes to 1v1 on 2v2. I took a couple years off from basketball and started again a couple months ago. Right now i’m 24, I’m only about 5’10, extremely good handle, solid shooter, but i’ve been getting COOKED in pickup games lately. I know the game well, I can rebound, set screens, give good passes and communicate. But I’ve been getting picked, and airballing shots at such a high rate. It purely might just a confidence issue but I feel like such a shell of my former self and just need some advice	7.0	t3_18un78p	reddit

The league is unbelievable competitive now and it’s unlikely to see dynasties repeating anytime soon. Both conferences have 3 obvious title contenders (celtics, sixers, bucks in the east and nuggets, t-wolves, and thunder in the west) and even outside of those main contenders they’re teams that still have legit cases to win a chip if they can put it together like the clippers, suns, lakers, heat and young teams that can be real threats by next year like the magic (who might even be a threat now). The league is just to talented now and although legends deserve their respect, a ring in the future is going to be worth much more than a ring in the past and it’s gonna affect the goat discussion.	2.0	t3_18ujrd6	reddit

148	How come abrasion oftentimes improves the grip and the spike?	Unknown	2023-12-30 04:10:15	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/18u6j2t/how_come_abrasion_oftentimes_improves_the_grip/	Science question. I noticed in experience that shoes often may be quiet at first but become more squeaky/sticky the more the player drags them on the surface. Probably that’s why most new shoes are silent. Also players and others who less drag shoes on the floor tend to squeak far less when they do. While there are many advices saying to not let shoes touch anything other the court but some other Google searches say abrasion on a rough surface sandpaper may help restore the grip. I am thinking thats likely the same reason skateboarders shoes can get very tacky if they skate hard since they abrase the boards sandpaper and the pavement all the time. I remember a group sounding like a bb game entering a market after a skatepark session. However the bad thing is abrasion also wears away the shoe faster.	2.0	t3_18u6j2t	reddit		
149	The Career of Davis Kettleman	Unknown	2023-12-30 08:55:28	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/18ubf2y/the_career_of_davis_kettleman/	The story I’m writing is about a boy named Davis Kettleman. He was born October 3rd 1980 in a town northeast of Atlanta called Cummings, Georgia. He was the first boy born out of a total of 5. It was Davis, Damian, Daniel, Donavan, and Colby. They all have their own paths to finding success in the sport of Basketball. Though, Davis was far more superior of his brothers. As he grew up as a kid, he would regularly go with his dad to work. His father Dyson was the Bigman Coach for the Atlanta Hawks. He played college basketball at Georgia Tech in the late 60s and early 70s and he badly hurt his knee in his Senior Year which led him to pursue a path in Coaching instead of playing professionally. Eventually, as more of his brothers were born, they would all go with their dad to the Hawks facility for team practices regularly and they all learned a lot from watching how professional players and coaches perfect their game. Watching prime Dominique Wilkins in person is quite surreal. Davis Kettleman attended Forsyth Central High School after grinding his way through Middle School, Grinding in order to prepare for the big jump between Middle School to most likely Varsity Basketball. During his time at Forsyth Central, he would find that his entire life would change gradually for the positive as the years went by. Through 4 years, he went from a 6’8 190 pound young, promising 4 to a 7’0 225 pound Monster who could practically do whatever he wanted to his competition. He won 2 state championships with Forsyth Central and had an unbelievably dominant senior year as he averaged over 40 points per game. He’s just such a versatile scorer and sneakily athletic for a guy his size. His long time work ethic and his perfectionist mentality allows for his style of play to be unstoppable for defenses, he can kill you in some many different ways. He smashed State High School Basketball records and was the set target by every college in the Nation. Despite the prestigious colleges that offered him, he decided to stay close to home as he committed to play for the Georgia Bulldogs which shocked the Nation. He played one season at Georgia and he did everything he could to make the most out of it before declaring for the NBA Draft. He played alongside another future NBA player, Jumaine Jones and they were coming off of a 20-15 season. Georgia was looked at like a dark horse compared to the rest of the Country. They surprised a lot of people and showed they were without a doubt the best team in the SEC after beating Auburn in a close Conference Championship game that Davis Kettleman closed out himself with a 3 as he had 42 points and 15 rebounds in that game in an 84-80 win. Georgia was ranked as the 8th best team in the Nation entering the National Playoffs. In the playoffs, they made it through very deep into the playoffs as their season was upended by the UCONN Huskies all the way in the Final Four led by none other then Richard Hamilton. Georgia ended the year at 29-6 and Davis Kettleman declared for the 1999 NBA Draft after averaging over 32 and 12 in his Freshmen Year. He won the Wooden & Naismith award almost unanimously and was without a doubt projected to be the #1 pick. At the time, he was considered to be one of the most hyped draft prospects of all time. In the Draft Lottery, it aligns beautifully as the Atlanta Hawks actually got the 1st Pick after being arguably the worst team in the NBA. In the 1999 NBA Draft, The Atlanta Hawks took Davis Kettleman with their 1st Pick in hopes to turn their franchise around and to hopefully even maybe bring a championship to Atlanta one day. If anyone’s going to come along and be the man to lead the way, it’ll be Kettleman and it’s time to rise to the expectations. I’m a bit late as I’m in December of the year 2000 and already in his 2nd season. I will be going live on Twitch to showcase the rest of his NBA Career. I’ll be going in depth with what’s going on in the league and what has happened in the NBA since the ‘92-‘93 Season as it’s in an ‘Alternate Basketball Universe’. If you read all the way through, I honestly couldn’t appreciate you more. Thank you and have a happy new years!	0.0	t3_18ubf2y	reddit

I usually play pickup games in my backyard on a full court, attracting people who play for fun. This was my first pickup game with strangers in over a year. There's always that one guy hogging the ball, blaming others for his bad passes. If you miss a couple of shots, suddenly you shouldn't be shooting. When his defender has a great day, it's somehow your fault. During a fast break, he scolded me for not sticking to my defender, who was already on the other side of the court, and got mad when my defender made threes with a hand up. In hindsight, I regret not saying, 'Bro, it's just a pickup game.' At 25, I shouldn't let someone boss me around in a casual game. How do you handle such situations?"""	98.0	t3_18tddd2	reddit

I’ve seen debates discussing where players rank all time and one of the things constantly brought up is finals records. It makes sense because to achieve the highest level of play in basketball is to win the most important championship in the game: The Larry O’Brian. But, finals records are weighted weird. For example, Lebron has a record of 4-6 in the finals. 10 finals appearances. More appearances than most greats. 8 straight trips. And being the best player on all 4 wins by a wide margin. This is while having some of the most toughest finals opponents ever. And then you have Jordan. 6-0, 6 appearances. Also more appearances than most greats, but there’s more greats that have went to 6 finals than those who have went to 10, making lebron’s record more “rare” in a way. But, Jordan won every single finals he went to, unlike lebron. He was also the best player for each win just like lebron and ended up winning more championships in less time, while having a tougher road to even get to the finals in the first place, the facing tough teams in the finals. One player went to the finals more, but won less. One went to the finals less, but won more. Is going to the finals itself a feat worthy enough to be more impressive than not appearing to the finals at all, even if you win less?	0.0	t3_18txt4u	reddit

What the heck can the Pistons do to come out of this? Forget draft picks and young talent, they're mired in something that destroys the psyche of young players, and drives fan support away. Right now, they need to get to a status of ""we aren't completely horrible"" - and that'll take an infusion of different blood, and some fire. I submit to you a ""buy low"" opportunity with the Golden State Warriors: Warriors get: Marvin Bagley III Alex Burks 2028 1st Round Pick Pistons get: Draymond Green NOW WAIT! Before you dismiss this as, ""guy doesn't know anything about basketball,"" hear me.out. Golden State is growing closer to ""addition by subtraction"" territory, and can justify trading Green thanks to the current string of suspensions. His contract won't age well, so getting some value from a desperate team would be wise. Burks is most likely getting bought out, with just a year on his contract. Bagley, if ANYONE can get something from that fella, this is the team. He's not untalented, and can likely become a reasonable rotation player. He's not here to replace Green, he's here to just contribute. Pistons owe picks for a while, but this COULD be a ""2027 if we didn't convey it, else 2028 situation"" - having two picks when they're likely ready to rebuild would be valuable. As for Draymond on the Pistons, he's not the same thing as Rodman (for those who bandy that about) but he IS what they need. The man passed and plays D better than anyone on the team. The kids can learn from him, and he'd inject that old Pistons FIRE into a squad that is burned out and just wishes the season would end. He'd also have the opportunity to be part of a redemption story (his and Detroit's) that the league would love. And a little bad boy attitude would be more welcomed vs his current West Coast digs. A Michigan kid, who played for Michigan State, coming back to drag the Pistons out of the muck. I think his impact on the guys who were seen as surefire stars would be immeasurable.

I’m not sure how much, but what I do remember was that included some programs and video clips with Drew Hanlen. It wasn’t Pure Sweat, it was some other program that had an orange and black logo. It had modules within it such as, increasing vertical jump, point guard skills, dribbling, improving jump shot, mediation, etc. I can’t seem to find the exact program, it was relevant around 2016-2018.

Certified lockdown. I run into this problem often. People driving to the basket and getting fouled but won’t call the foul. Like they’re scared to say the F word. Or they want to appear too good. Many times I’ve heard people complain about getting hacked while the other team is out on a break, but they won’t say anything but “he’s hacking”. I call every foul I can reasonably get away with so they know not to just hack every drive. If it’s even close we can always shoot for it. But I’m always gonna call it. And stop calling fouls for your teammate. That’s a grown man. He can talk. This kid I hooped with the other day turned the ball over 5 times. Got fouled every play but didn’t say a word.

My goal is to get this story out there on the Internet to see if maybe people would be interested at all since it’d be reaching the target audience. It might sound like a very unorthodox idea, and it could lose some people because of its reputation over the last few years, but the games he plays in his NBA career are played on realistic settings or simulated in NBA 2K and was planning on giving them credit if I ever go through with the story as I plan to. I will describe the base of the story and go more in depth of the main character on here very soon. I have a few different ideas with other guys from different sports that do the same thing as this one. They’re all fantasy biographies that I have of athletes who never existed and are completely made up by me and my imagination.

Unknown	2023-12-26 02:15:52	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/18qx7c5/offensive_approach_for_low_level_middle_school/	I coach a low level middle school team. I have the kids who are pretty tall, but rather uncoordinated, the athletic kids with good length who can't shoot or put the ball on the floor, and the too small guards who can't penetrate without getting swallowed up. I would also say that BBIQ is pretty low across the board, and for some of the kids even being on the correct side of the court is a real challenge. On the plus side, I would say that we typically are taller than just about all the teams that we play. Based on this, I had set up our approach to be a 4 out, 1 in motion offense with the guards attacking the basket and potentially dishing off to one of the bigs. Unfortunately, we are just getting absolutely destroyed against 2-3 zone defenses (and once in a while a 1-3-1). So, I'm wondering if I should just go to a completely different approach. We of course have worked on getting the ball to the high post, but I'm wondering if we should approach this with a different setup than the 4 out, 1 in. For example, would more of a 3 out, 2 in setup work better for us? Where one of the wings is flashing to the high post? I've also thought about going to a 1-4 setup with 4 players across the free throw line / extended. That would enable some back door cuts from the wings and give us a chance to maybe just hit some shots from the elbow. But, I worry a bit with a 1-4 set they'll just end up being very static (movement without the ball is not our strength). I've also considered just going with the 3 out, 2 in and let the guards and wings bomb away and pray for an offensive rebound (we are a pretty good offensive rebounding team). Not very pretty basketball, of course.	6.0	t3_18qx7c5	reddit

The problem with this is I am 6'2 160lbs, and he is 6'3, 220lbs, has a much larger wingspan than me and has bigger hands than me as well. I guard him well for the most part, except when he drives in and basically does a extremely close shot (kinda fade away) off the backboard. How do I contest this? Whenever I try to contest it, I cant reach the ball to block it and my contest doesnt throw off his shot. He's got almost 60lbs on me so I can't just body him when he tries to get into the paint. This is basically the only way he can score on me and we are both easily the best players on the floor so I need to know how I can stop this. I've tried double teams but my team dont know how to double team without just getting in the way of me guarding him and giving him an easier shot over someone even shorter.	38.0	t3_18q9nnf	reddit

Seems to mostly pertain to guards coming off pin downs and DHO’s… where the objective is to catch it, square up to shoot/drive for a .5 or 1 second count. If not on, swing the ball. Most times the motion or play is a pass screen away action. How does this with Point Fwd/Centers whi play on top, the nail or elbows? Players like Jokic, Draymond, Sengun, Sabonis etc… seem to hold the ball a lot longer looking to hit the split cut (to the rim) then execute the DHO. Do they not have the same rule? Guards wings are told to look to score, what’s the bigger guys read progression. Ex: look to pass and last resort score? Ex: score then look to facilitate? They have to be taught something or way to read the game.	4.0	t3_18q87k6	reddit

I’ve never hooped at any kind of team level (didn’t play high school or college ball) - the highest level I’ve probably played at is intramural. With those stats, would I be able to beat someone like Caitlin Clark in a one on one? She is supposedly the best Women’s basketball prospect, and is of a similar height to me. I would most definitely have the clear strength advantage, and could definitely out jump her, but would the complete athletic mismatch make up for my lack of ultra high level basketball skills compared to her (she is a way better shooter than me for example) Now, what if we paired me up against someone like Brittany Griner? She’s got about 7 inches of height on me, and based on the fact that she’s dunked before, could outjump me. However, I was reading this post that says women are on average only 60% as strong pound for pound as men. Considering Brittany and I weight almost the same too, that leads me to believe I’d still be a fair amount stronger than her. All those factors considered, who would I be able to beat in a one on one? One? Both? Or neither?	0.0	t3_18p8yar	reddit

While I did luckily scored several times in the 3v3, feedbacks from my classmates were that I played too aggresively and I would probably violate the rules in actual games. However, the coach said he couldn’t figure out how to actually use me in a game because I’m too slow and I “play like I’m scared”. Honestly I’m just lost. I still practice my handle, throw and dribble daily, but other than that, I never seem to understand my teammates. Can everyone give me some advices? Thank you so much!	3.0	t3_18olbwk	reddit

Separating indoor and outdoor shoes just like in a home or certain parts of the world Especially if it’s made of hardwood Even if the facility doesn’t have a strict rule on it is sign of one’s respect to the facility and others playing on it. Ie avoid leaving slippery gunk on floor? Or wearing out the court prematurely with pebbles stuck in the threads? Also to avoid loud squealing noises when the shoe contacts a tacky surface especially after play Or smelly feet from wearing them too long. I remember back in the days youngsters didn’t care and often wore their loud queaky shoes into neighboring libraries, classrooms, stores, And often skip out on taking them off at home, maybe wanting to play at moments notice without untie retieing them or just too cool. It’s a whole different world today.	4.0	t3_18ostlv	reddit

259	Am I a Baller? Basketball Performance Assessment from First-Person Videos	Gedas Bertasius	2016-11-16 17:01:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05365v4	This paper presents a method to assess a basketball player's performance from his/her first-person video. A key challenge lies in the fact that the evaluation metric is highly subjective and specific to a particular evaluator. We leverage the first-person camera to address this challenge. The spatiotemporal visual semantics provided by a first-person view allows us to reason about the camera wearer's actions while he/she is participating in an unscripted basketball game. Our method takes a player's first-person video and provides a player's performance measure that is specific to an evaluator's preference. To achieve this goal, we first use a convolutional LSTM network to detect atomic basketball events from first-person videos. Our network's ability to zoom-in to the salient regions addresses the issue of a severe camera wearer's head movement in first-person videos. The detected atomic events are then passed through the Gaussian mixtures to construct a highly non-linear visual spatiotemporal basketball assessment feature. Finally, we use this feature to learn a basketball assessment model from pairs of labeled first-person basketball videos, for which a basketball expert indicates, which of the two players is better. We demonstrate that despite not knowing the basketball evaluator's criterion, our model learns to accurately assess the players in real-world games. Furthermore, our model can also discover basketball events that contribute positively and negatively to a player's performance.			arxiv	['Hyun Soo Park', 'Stella X. Yu', 'Jianbo Shi']	1.0
260	Application of Monte Carlo Simulations to Improve Basketball Shooting Strategy	Byeong June Min	2016-06-27 07:28:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08145v2	The underlying physics of basketball shooting seems to be a straightforward example of the Newtonian mechanics that can easily be traced by numerical methods. However, a human basketball player does not make use of all the possible basketball trajectories. Instead, a basketball player will build up a database of successful shots and select the trajectory that has the greatest tolerance to small variations of the real world. We simulate the basketball player's shooting training as a Monte Carlo sequence to build optimal shooting strategies, such as the launch speed and angle of the basketball, and whether to take a direct shot or a bank shot, as a function of the player's court positions and height. The phase space volume that belongs to the successful launch velocities generated by Monte Carlo simulations are then used as the criterion to optimize a shooting strategy that incorporates not only mechanical, but human factors as well.			arxiv	[]	2.0
261	A Continuous-time Stochastic Block Model for Basketball Networks	Lu Xin	2015-07-04 20:14:45	http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01816v2	For professional basketball, finding valuable and suitable players is the key to building a winning team. To deal with such challenges, basketball managers, scouts and coaches are increasingly turning to analytics. Objective evaluation of players and teams has always been the top goal of basketball analytics. Typical statistical analytics mainly focuses on the box score and has developed various metrics. In spite of the more and more advanced methods, metrics built upon box score statistics provide limited information about how players interact with each other. Two players with similar box scores may deliver distinct team plays. Thus professional basketball scouts have to watch real games to evaluate players. Live scouting is effective, but suffers from inefficiency and subjectivity. In this paper, we go beyond the static box score and model basketball games as dynamic networks. The proposed Continuous-time Stochastic Block Model clusters the players according to their playing style and performance. The model provides cluster-specific estimates of the effectiveness of players at scoring, rebounding, stealing, etc, and also captures player interaction patterns within and between clusters. By clustering similar players together, the model can help basketball scouts to narrow down the search space. Moreover, the model is able to reveal the subtle differences in the offensive strategies of different teams. An application to NBA basketball games illustrates the performance of the model.			arxiv	['Mu Zhu', 'Hugh Chipman']	3.0

Data is collected from the Euroleague's official website for the seasons 2016-2017, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, i.e. in the new format era. Features are extracted from matches' data and off-the-shelf supervised machine learning techniques are applied. We calibrate and validate our models. We find that simple machine learning models give accuracy not greater than 67% on the test set, worse than some sophisticated benchmark models. Additionally, the importance of this study lies in the ""wisdom of the basketball crowd"" and we demonstrate how the predicting power of a collective group of basketball enthusiasts can outperform machine learning models discussed in this study.

263	Fever Basketball: A Complex, Flexible, and Asynchronized Sports Game Environment for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning	Hangtian Jia	2020-12-06 07:51:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03204v1	The development of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has benefited from the emergency of a variety type of game environments where new challenging problems are proposed and new algorithms can be tested safely and quickly, such as Board games, RTS, FPS, and MOBA games. However, many existing environments lack complexity and flexibility and assume the actions are synchronously executed in multi-agent settings, which become less valuable. We introduce the Fever Basketball game, a novel reinforcement learning environment where agents are trained to play basketball game. It is a complex and challenging environment that supports multiple characters, multiple positions, and both the single-agent and multi-agent player control modes. In addition, to better simulate real-world basketball games, the execution time of actions differs among players, which makes Fever Basketball a novel asynchronized environment. We evaluate commonly used multi-agent algorithms of both independent learners and joint-action learners in three game scenarios with varying difficulties, and heuristically propose two baseline methods to diminish the extra non-stationarity brought by asynchronism in Fever Basketball Benchmarks. Besides, we propose an integrated curricula training (ICT) framework to better handle Fever Basketball problems, which includes several game-rule based cascading curricula learners and a coordination curricula switcher focusing on enhancing coordination within the team. The results show that the game remains challenging and can be used as a benchmark environment for studies like long-time horizon, sparse rewards, credit assignment, and non-stationarity, etc. in multi-agent settings.			arxiv	['Yujing Hu', 'Yingfeng Chen', 'Chunxu Ren', 'Tangjie Lv', 'Changjie Fan', 'Chongjie Zhang']	5.0

To do this, we first introduce a future convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts an initial sequence of 12D camera configurations, aiming to capture how real players move during a one-on-one basketball game. We also introduce a goal verifier network, which is trained to verify that a given camera configuration is consistent with the final goals of real one-on-one basketball players. Next, we propose an inverse synthesis procedure to synthesize a refined sequence of 12D camera configurations that (1) sufficiently matches the initial configurations predicted by the future CNN, while (2) maximizing the output of the goal verifier network. Finally, by following the trajectory resulting from the refined camera configuration sequence, we obtain the complete 12D motion sequence. Our model generates realistic basketball motion sequences that capture the goals of real players, outperforming standard deep learning approaches such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs).			arxiv	['Aaron Chan', 'Jianbo Shi']	6.0

Basketball activities lend themselves well for measurement by wrist-worn inertial sensors, and systems that are able to detect such sport-relevant activities could be used in applications toward game analysis, guided training, and personal physical activity tracking. The dataset was recorded for two teams from separate countries (USA and Germany) with a total of 24 players who wore an inertial sensor on their wrist, during both repetitive basketball training sessions and full games. Particular features of this dataset include an inherent variance through cultural differences in game rules and styles as the data was recorded in two countries, as well as different sport skill levels, since the participants were heterogeneous in terms of prior basketball experience.

266	The Quest for Omnioculars: Embedded Visualization for Augmenting Basketball Game Viewing Experiences	Tica Lin	2022-09-01 03:33:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00202v1	Sports game data is becoming increasingly complex, often consisting of multivariate data such as player performance stats, historical team records, and athletes' positional tracking information. While numerous visual analytics systems have been developed for sports analysts to derive insights, few tools target fans to improve their understanding and engagement of sports data during live games. By presenting extra data in the actual game views, embedded visualization has the potential to enhance fans' game-viewing experience. However, little is known about how to design such kinds of visualizations embedded into live games. In this work, we present a user-centered design study of developing interactive embedded visualizations for basketball fans to improve their live game-watching experiences. We first conducted a formative study to characterize basketball fans' in-game analysis behaviors and tasks. Based on our findings, we propose a design framework to inform the design of embedded visualizations based on specific data-seeking contexts. Following the design framework, we present five novel embedded visualization designs targeting five representative contexts identified by the fans, including shooting, offense, defense, player evaluation, and team comparison. We then developed Omnioculars, an interactive basketball game-viewing prototype that features the proposed embedded visualizations for fans' in-game data analysis. We evaluated Omnioculars in a simulated basketball game with basketball fans. The study results suggest that our design supports personalized in-game data analysis and enhances game understanding and engagement.			arxiv	['Zhutian Chen', 'Yalong Yang', 'Daniele Chiappalupi', 'Johanna Beyer', 'Hanspeter Pfister']	8.0

Effective field goal percentages from the resulting shot attempts can be used to characterize the efficiency of each pathway. Inspired by recent discussions of the ""price of anarchy"" in traffic networks, this paper makes a formal analogy between a basketball offense and a simplified traffic network. The analysis suggests that there may be a significant difference between taking the highest-percentage shot each time down the court and playing the most efficient possible game. There may also be an analogue of Braess's Paradox in basketball, such that removing a key player from a team can result in the improvement of the team's offensive efficiency."			arxiv	[]	11.0
270	Random Walk Picture of Basketball Scoring	Alan Gabel	2011-09-13 15:22:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.2825v2	We present evidence, based on play-by-play data from all 6087 games from the 2006/07--2009/10 seasons of the National Basketball Association (NBA), that basketball scoring is well described by a weakly-biased continuous-time random walk. The time between successive scoring events follows an exponential distribution, with little memory between different scoring intervals. Using this random-walk picture that is augmented by features idiosyncratic to basketball, we account for a wide variety of statistical properties of scoring, such as the distribution of the score difference between opponents and the fraction of game time that one team is in the lead. By further including the heterogeneity of team strengths, we build a computational model that accounts for essentially all statistical features of game scoring data and season win/loss records of each team.			arxiv	['S.

271	Is coaching experience associated with effective use of timeouts in basketball?	Serguei Saavedra	2012-05-07 19:45:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1492v2	Experience is an important asset in almost any professional activity. In basketball, there is believed to be a positive association between coaching experience and effective use of team timeouts. Here, we analyze both the extent to which a team's change in scoring margin per possession after timeouts deviate from the team's average scoring margin per possession---what we called timeout factor, and the extent to which this performance measure is associated with coaching experience across all teams in the National Basketball Association over the 2009-2012 seasons. We find that timeout factor plays a minor role in the scoring dynamics of basketball. Surprisingly, we find that timeout factor is negatively associated with coaching experience. Our findings support empirical studies showing that, under certain conditions, mentors early in their careers can have a stronger positive impact on their teams than later in their careers.			arxiv	['Satyam Mukherjee', 'James P.

272	A Multiresolution Stochastic Process Model for Predicting Basketball Possession Outcomes	Daniel Cervone	2014-08-04 19:22:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0777v3	Basketball games evolve continuously in space and time as players constantly interact with their teammates, the opposing team, and the ball. However, current analyses of basketball outcomes rely on discretized summaries of the game that reduce such interactions to tallies of points, assists, and similar events. In this paper, we propose a framework for using optical player tracking data to estimate, in real time, the expected number of points obtained by the end of a possession. This quantity, called \textit{expected possession value} (EPV), derives from a stochastic process model for the evolution of a basketball possession; we model this process at multiple levels of resolution, differentiating between continuous, infinitesimal movements of players, and discrete events such as shot attempts and turnovers. Transition kernels are estimated using hierarchical spatiotemporal models that share information across players while remaining computationally tractable on very large data sets. In addition to estimating EPV, these models reveal novel insights on players' decision-making tendencies as a function of their spatial strategy.			arxiv	"[""Alex D'Amour"", 'Luke Bornn', 'Kirk Goldsberry']"	14.0

Sliz	2017-03-21 02:45:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07030v1	I address the difficult challenge of measuring the relative influence of competing basketball game strategies, and I apply my analysis to plays resulting in three-point shots. I use a glut of SportVU player tracking data from over 600 NBA games to derive custom position-based features that capture tangible game strategies from game-play data, such as teamwork, player matchups, and on-ball defender distances. Then, I demonstrate statistical methods for measuring the relative importance of any given basketball strategy. In doing so, I highlight the high importance of teamwork based strategies in affecting three-point shot success. By coupling SportVU data with an advanced variable importance algorithm I am able to extract meaningful results that would have been impossible to achieve even 3 years ago. Further, I demonstrate how player-tracking based features can be used to measure the three- point shooting propensity of players, and I show how this measurement can identify effective shooters that are either highly-utilized or under-utilized. Altogether, my findings provide a substantial body of work for influencing basketball strategy, and for measuring the effectiveness of basketball players.			arxiv	[]	15.0

We extend a state-of-the-art multi-resolution stochastic process approach to modeling basketball by modeling passes between teammates as directed dynamic relational links on a network and introduce multiplicative latent factors to study higher-order patterns in players' interactions that distinguish a successful game from a loss. Parameters are estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler. Results in simulation experiments suggest that the sampling scheme is effective in recovering the parameters. We then apply the model to the first high-resolution optical tracking dataset collected in college basketball games. The learned latent factors demonstrate significant differences between players' passing and receiving tendencies in a loss than those in a win. The model is applicable to team sports other than basketball, as well as other time-varying network observations.			arxiv	['Sonia Xu', 'Katherine Heller', 'Alexander Volfovsky']	16.0

At the team level, we discuss methods for characterizing team strategy and performance, while at the player level, we take a deep look into a myriad of tools for player evaluation. This includes metrics for overall player value, defensive ability, and shot modeling, and methods for understanding performance over multiple seasons via player production curves. We conclude with a discussion on the future of basketball analytics, and in particular highlight the need for causal inference in sports.			arxiv	['Alexander Franks']	17.0

However, conventional methods always utilize isolated statistical data, leading to ineffective and inaccurate evaluations. Existing models based on dynamic network theory offer major improvements to the results of such evaluations, but said models remain imprecise because they focus merely on evaluating the values of individual players rather than considering them within their current teams. To solve this problem, we propose an analysis and evaluation model based on networks and a hidden Markov model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to combine a network form representing the players who are playing with the use of a hidden Markov model to mine the network and generate the desired results. Applying our approach to SportVU data collected from the National Basketball Association shows that this analysis and evaluation model can effectively analyze the performance of each player in a game and provides an assistive tool for team managers.			arxiv	['Weihong Cai', 'Jianquan Liu', 'Ding Yu', 'Kai Xu', 'Wei Li']	18.0
277	A Bayesian hidden Markov model for assessing the hot hand phenomenon in basketball shooting performance	Gabriel Calvo	2023-03-31 07:51:01	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17863v1	Sports data analytics is a relevant topic in applied statistics that has been growing in importance in recent years. In basketball, a player or team has a hot hand when their performance during a match is better than expected or they are on a streak of making consecutive shots. This phenomenon has generated a great deal of controversy with detractors claiming its non-existence while other authors indicate its evidence. In this work, we present a Bayesian longitudinal hidden Markov model that analyses the hot hand phenomenon in consecutive basketball shots, each of which can be either missed or made. Two possible states (cold or hot) are assumed in the hidden Markov chains of events, and the probability of success for each throw is modelled by considering both the corresponding hidden state and the distance to the basket. This model is applied to a real data set, the Miami Heat team in the season 2005-2006 of the USA National Basketball Association. We show that this model is a powerful tool for assessing the overall performance of a team during a match or a season, and, in particular, for quantifying the magnitude of the team streaks in probabilistic terms.			arxiv	['Carmen Armero', 'Luigi Spezia']	19.0

This paper presents a data-driven tool that effectively determines optimal team line-ups based on past performance data and metrics for player effectiveness. Our proposed methodology involves combining a Bayesian longitudinal model with an integer linear problem to optimise the line-up of a wheelchair basketball team. To illustrate our approach, we use real data from a team competing in the Rollstuhlbasketball Bundesliga, namely the Doneck Dolphins Trier. We consider three distinct performance metrics for each player and incorporate uncertainty from the posterior predictive distribution of the longitudinal model into the optimisation process. The results demonstrate the tool's ability to select the most suitable team compositions and calculate posterior probabilities of compatibility or incompatibility among players on the court.			arxiv	['Carmen Armero', 'Bernd Grimm', 'Christophe Ley']	20.0
279	Characterizing the spatial structure of defensive skill in professional basketball	Alexander Franks	2014-05-01 17:39:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0231v3	Although basketball is a dualistic sport, with all players competing on both offense and defense, almost all of the sport's conventional metrics are designed to summarize offensive play. As a result, player valuations are largely based on offensive performances and to a much lesser degree on defensive ones. Steals, blocks and defensive rebounds provide only a limited summary of defensive effectiveness, yet they persist because they summarize salient events that are easy to observe. Due to the inefficacy of traditional defensive statistics, the state of the art in defensive analytics remains qualitative, based on expert intuition and analysis that can be prone to human biases and imprecision. Fortunately, emerging optical player tracking systems have the potential to enable a richer quantitative characterization of basketball performance, particularly defensive performance. Unfortunately, due to computational and methodological complexities, that potential remains unmet. This paper attempts to fill this void, combining spatial and spatio-temporal processes, matrix factorization techniques and hierarchical regression models with player tracking data to advance the state of defensive analytics in the NBA. Our approach detects, characterizes and quantifies multiple aspects of defensive play in basketball, supporting some common understandings of defensive effectiveness, challenging others and opening up many new insights into the defensive elements of basketball.			arxiv	['Andrew Miller', 'Luke Bornn', 'Kirk Goldsberry']	21.0
280	Professional Basketball Player Behavior Synthesis via Planning with Diffusion	Xiusi Chen	2023-06-07 01:23:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04090v2	Dynamically planning in multi-agent systems has been explored to improve decision-making in various domains. Professional basketball serves as a compelling example of a dynamic spatio-temporal game, encompassing both concealed strategic policies and decision-making. However, processing the diverse on-court signals and navigating the vast space of potential actions and outcomes makes it difficult for existing approaches to swiftly identify optimal strategies in response to evolving circumstances. In this study, we first formulate the sequential decision-making process as a conditional trajectory generation process. We further introduce PLAYBEST (PLAYer BEhavior SynThesis), a method for enhancing player decision-making. We extend the state-of-the-art generative model, diffusion probabilistic model, to learn challenging multi-agent environmental dynamics from historical National Basketball Association (NBA) player motion tracking data. To incorporate data-driven strategies, an auxiliary value function is trained using the play-by-play data with corresponding rewards acting as the plan guidance. To accomplish reward-guided trajectory generation, conditional sampling is introduced to condition the diffusion model on the value function and conduct classifier-guided sampling. We validate the effectiveness of PLAYBEST via comprehensive simulation studies from real-world data, contrasting the generated trajectories and play strategies with those employed by professional basketball teams. Our results reveal that the model excels at generating high-quality basketball trajectories that yield efficient plays, surpassing conventional planning techniques in terms of adaptability, flexibility, and overall performance. Moreover, the synthesized play strategies exhibit a remarkable alignment with professional tactics, highlighting the model's capacity to capture the intricate dynamics of basketball games.			arxiv	['Wei-Yao Wang', 'Ziniu Hu', 'Curtis Chou', 'Lam Hoang', 'Kun Jin', 'Mingyan Liu', 'P.

By the maximum principle, a harmonic curve has no bounded components; its topology is determined by the combinatorial data of a noncrossing matching. Similarly, every complex polynomial gives rise to a related combinatorial object that we call a basketball, consisting of a pair of noncrossing matchings satisfying one additional constraint. We prove that every noncrossing matching arises from some harmonic curve, and deduce from this that every basketball arises from some polynomial.			arxiv	['David Savitt', 'Ted Singer']	24.0

As free throws occur at unevenly spaced time points within a game, we consider a state-space model formulated in continuous time to investigate serial dependence in players' success probabilities. In particular, the underlying state process can be interpreted as a player's (latent) varying form and is modelled using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our results support the existence of the hot hand, but the magnitude of the estimated effect is rather small.			arxiv	['Marius Ötting']	28.0

To deal with the existence of temporal autocorrelation in the data, the model is endowed with a doubly self-exciting structure, following the INGARCH(1,1) specification. To estimate the model at the within-game level, a divide-and-conquer procedure, under a Bayesian framework, is carried out. The model is tested with a selection of NBA teams and players from the 2018-2019 season.			arxiv	[]	30.0

An alternative heuristic is derived by adjusting the assumptions that justify Z-scores to incorporate uncertainty in weekly performance. It is dubbed the ""G-score"", and it outperforms the traditional Z-score approach in simulations. A more sophisticated algorithm is also derived, which dynamically adapts to previously chosen players to create a cohesive team.

In this paper, I explore the question of when a team should shoot and when they should pass up the shot by considering a simple theoretical model of the shot selection process, in which the quality of shot opportunities generated by the offense is assumed to fall randomly within a uniform distribution. I derive an answer to the question ""how likely must the shot be to go in before the player should take it?"", and show that this ""lower cutoff"" for shot quality $f$ depends crucially on the number $n$ of shot opportunities remaining (say, before the shot clock expires), with larger $n$ demanding that only higher-quality shots should be taken. The function $f(n)$ is also derived in the presence of a finite turnover rate and used to predict the shooting rate of an optimal-shooting team as a function of time. This prediction is compared to observed shooting rates from the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the comparison suggests that NBA players tend to wait too long before shooting and undervalue the probability of committing a turnover."			arxiv	[]	32.0

Given an offensive set play sketch, our method simulates potential scenarios that may occur in the game. The simulation provides coaches and players with insights on how a given set play can be executed. To achieve the goal, we train a conditional adversarial network on NBA movement data to imitate the behaviors of how players move around the court through two major components: a generator that learns to generate natural player movements based on a latent noise and a user sketched set play; and a discriminator that is used to evaluate the realism of the basketball play. To improve the quality of simulation, we minimize 1.) a dribbler loss to prevent the ball from drifting away from the dribbler; 2.) a defender loss to prevent the dribbler from not being defended; 3.) a ball passing loss to ensure the straightness of passing trajectories; and 4) an acceleration loss to minimize unnecessary players' movements. To evaluate our system, we objectively compared real and simulated basketball set plays. Besides, a subjective test was conducted to judge whether a set play was real or generated by our network. On average, the mean correct rates to the binary tests were 56.17 \%. Experiment results and the evaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of our system.			arxiv	['Chieh-Yu Chen', 'Yu-Shuen Wang', 'Jung-Hong Chuang']	34.0
293	The role of intrinsic dimension in high-resolution player tracking data -- Insights in basketball	Edgar Santos-Fernandez	2020-02-11 00:34:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04148v1	A new range of statistical analysis has emerged in sports after the introduction of the high-resolution player tracking technology, specifically in basketball. However, this high dimensional data is often challenging for statistical inference and decision making. In this article, we employ Hidalgo, a state-of-the-art Bayesian mixture model that allows the estimation of heterogeneous intrinsic dimensions (ID) within a dataset and propose some theoretical enhancements. ID results can be interpreted as indicators of variability and complexity of basketball plays and games. This technique allows classification and clustering of NBA basketball player's movement and shot charts data. Analyzing movement data, Hidalgo identifies key stages of offensive actions such as creating space for passing, preparation/shooting and following through. We found that the ID value spikes reaching a peak between 4 and 8 seconds in the offensive part of the court after which it declines. In shot charts, we obtained groups of shots that produce substantially higher and lower successes. Overall, game-winners tend to have a larger intrinsic dimension which is an indication of more unpredictability and unique shot placements. Similarly, we found higher ID values in plays when the score margin is small compared to large margin ones. These outcomes could be exploited by coaches to obtain better offensive/defensive results.			arxiv	['Francesco Denti', 'Kerrie Mengersen', 'Antonietta Mira']	35.0
294	Fusing Motion Patterns and Key Visual Information for Semantic Event Recognition in Basketball Videos	Lifang Wu	2020-07-13 10:15:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06288v1	Many semantic events in team sport activities e.g. basketball often involve both group activities and the outcome (score or not). Motion patterns can be an effective means to identify different activities. Global and local motions have their respective emphasis on different activities, which are difficult to capture from the optical flow due to the mixture of global and local motions. Hence it calls for a more effective way to separate the global and local motions. When it comes to the specific case for basketball game analysis, the successful score for each round can be reliably detected by the appearance variation around the basket. Based on the observations, we propose a scheme to fuse global and local motion patterns (MPs) and key visual information (KVI) for semantic event recognition in basketball videos. Firstly, an algorithm is proposed to estimate the global motions from the mixed motions based on the intrinsic property of camera adjustments. And the local motions could be obtained from the mixed and global motions. Secondly, a two-stream 3D CNN framework is utilized for group activity recognition over the separated global and local motion patterns. Thirdly, the basket is detected and its appearance features are extracted through a CNN structure. The features are utilized to predict the success or failure. Finally, the group activity recognition and success/failure prediction results are integrated using the kronecker product for event recognition. Experiments on NCAA dataset demonstrate that the proposed method obtains state-of-the-art performance.			arxiv	['Zhou Yang', 'Qi Wang', 'Meng Jian', 'Boxuan Zhao', 'Junchi Yan', 'Chang Wen Chen']	36.0

This paper attempts to answer this question using data from the 2014 men's basketball tournament and more than 400 predictions of game outcomes submitted to a contest hosted by the website Kaggle. We begin by describing how we built a prediction model for men's basketball tournament outcomes under the binomial log-likelihood loss function. Next, under different sets of true underlying game probabilities, we simulate tournament outcomes and imputed pool standings, in an effort to determine how much of an entry's success can be attributed to luck. While one of our two submissions finished first in the Kaggle contest, we estimate that this winning entry had no more than about a 12% chance of doing so, even under the most optimistic of game probability scenarios.			arxiv	['Gregory Matthews']	37.0

In particular, we consider the principles of allocative efficiency (optimal allocation of shots between offensive options), dynamic efficiency (optimal shot selection in the face of pressure from the shot clock), and the risk/reward tradeoff (strategic manipulation of outcome variance). For each principle, we provide a simple example of a strategic problem and show how it can be described analytically. We then review general analytical results and provide an overview of existing statistical studies. A number of open challenges in basketball analysis are highlighted.			arxiv	['Matthew Goldman']	38.0

We do so using only the thirty-year record of which visiting teams played which home teams, on what date, and what the final score was. No real ""statistics"" are used. The method works best in basketball, likely because it is high-scoring and has long seasons. It works better in football and hockey than in baseball, but in baseball the predictions are closer to a theoretical optimum. The football predictions, while good, can in principle be made much better, and the hockey predictions can be made somewhat better. These findings tells us that in basketball, most statistics are subsumed by the scores of the games, whereas in football, further study of game and player statistics is necessary to predict games as well as can be done. Baseball and hockey lie somewhere in between."			arxiv	[]	39.0

Previous approaches to similar problems center on hand-crafting features to capture domain specific knowledge. Although intuitive, recent work in deep learning has shown this approach is prone to missing important predictive features. To circumvent this issue, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach where we initially represent the multiagent behavior as an image. To encode the adversarial nature of basketball, we use a multi-channel image which we then feed into a CNN. Additionally, to capture the temporal aspect of the trajectories we ""fade"" the player trajectories. We find that this approach is superior to a traditional FFN model. By using gradient ascent to create images using an already trained CNN, we discover what features the CNN filters learn. Last, we find that a combined CNN+FFN is the best performing network with an error rate of 39%."			arxiv	['Abdolghani Ebrahimi', 'Patrick Lucey', 'Diego Klabjan']	40.0
299	Applying Deep Bidirectional LSTM and Mixture Density Network for Basketball Trajectory Prediction	Yu Zhao	2017-08-19 08:36:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05824v1	Data analytics helps basketball teams to create tactics. However, manual data collection and analytics are costly and ineffective. Therefore, we applied a deep bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and mixture density network (MDN) approach. This model is not only capable of predicting a basketball trajectory based on real data, but it also can generate new trajectory samples. It is an excellent application to help coaches and players decide when and where to shoot. Its structure is particularly suitable for dealing with time series problems. BLSTM receives forward and backward information at the same time, while stacking multiple BLSTMs further increases the learning ability of the model. Combined with BLSTMs, MDN is used to generate a multi-modal distribution of outputs. Thus, the proposed model can, in principle, represent arbitrary conditional probability distributions of output variables. We tested our model with two experiments on three-pointer datasets from NBA SportVu data. In the hit-or-miss classification experiment, the proposed model outperformed other models in terms of the convergence speed and accuracy. In the trajectory generation experiment, eight model-generated trajectories at a given time closely matched real trajectories.			arxiv	['Rennong Yang', 'Guillaume Chevalier', 'Rajiv Shah', 'Rob Romijnders']	41.0

When modeling such settings, it is often beneficial to design hierarchical models that can capture long-term coordination using intermediate variables. Furthermore, these intermediate variables should capture interesting high-level behavioral semantics in an interpretable and manipulatable way. We present a hierarchical framework that can effectively learn such sequential generative models. Our approach is inspired by recent work on leveraging programmatically produced weak labels, which we extend to the spatiotemporal regime. In addition to synthetic settings, we show how to instantiate our framework to effectively model complex interactions between basketball players and generate realistic multi-agent trajectories of basketball gameplay over long time periods. We validate our approach using both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user study comparison conducted with professional sports analysts.			arxiv	['Stephan Zheng', 'Yisong Yue', 'Long Sha', 'Patrick Lucey']	42.0

Bayesian hierarchical models are employed in the modeling and parametrization of the transition probabilities to borrow strength across players and through time. To enable computational feasibility, we combine lineup-specific MDPs into team-average MDPs using a novel transition weighting scheme. Specifically, we derive the dynamics of the team-average process such that the expected transition count for an arbitrary state-pair is equal to the weighted sum of the expected counts of the separate lineup-specific MDPs. We then utilize these non-stationary MDPs in the creation of a basketball play simulator with uncertainty propagated via posterior samples of the model components. After calibration, we simulate seasons both on-policy and under altered policies and explore the net changes in efficiency and production under the alternate policies. Additionally, we discuss the game-theoretic ramifications of testing alternative decision policies.			arxiv	['Luke Bornn']	43.0

With the advent of Information Technologies, collecting, processing and storing big amounts of sport data in different form became possible. A problem that often arises when using sport data regards the need for automatic data cleaning procedures. In this paper we develop a data cleaning procedure for basketball which is based on players' trajectories. Starting from a data matrix that tracks the movements of the players on the court at different moments in the game, we propose an algorithm to automatically drop inactive moments making use of available sensor data. The algorithm also divides the game into sorted actions and labels them as offensive or defensive. The algorithm's parameters are validated using proper robustness checks.			arxiv	[]	44.0

An ablation study is carried out and then used to remark that a robust tracker can be built with Deep Learning features, without the need of extracting contextual ones, such as proximity or color similarity, nor applying camera stabilization techniques. The presented tracker consists of: (1) a detection step, which uses a pretrained deep learning model to estimate the players pose, followed by (2) a tracking step, which leverages pose and semantic information from the output of a convolutional layer in a VGG network. Its performance is analyzed in terms of MOTA over a basketball dataset with more than 10k instances.			arxiv	['Coloma Ballester', 'Gloria Haro']	45.0

We estimate the movement intention by observing human user's joint angle, angluar velocity, and muscle activities for very short period of time. A task-related low-dimensional feature space is extracted from the observed user's movement data. We assume that discrete number of optimal control laws associated to different target tasks are pre-computed. Then, the optimal assistive policy is derived by blending the pre-computed optimal control laws based on the linear Bellman combination method. Coefficients that determine how to blend the control laws are derived based on the low-dimensional feature value that represents the user's movement intention. To validate our proposed method, we conducted basketball throwing tasks. In these experiments, subjects were asked to throw a basketball into a hoop placed at different throwing distances. The distances from the throwing point to the hoop were estimated as the user's movement intention and the optimal control policies were derived by using our proposed method. The results showed that the basketball throwing performances of the subjects were mostly improved.			arxiv	['Jun Morimoto']	46.0

When shooting the basketball, the obvious control parameters are the launch speed and the launch angle. We propose to use the three-dimensional velocity phase-space volume associated with the given launch parameters to quantify the difficulty of the shooting. The optimal launch angle that maximizes the associated phase-space volume undergoes a bifurcation as the launch speed is increased, if the shooter is farther than a critical distance away from the hoop. Thus, the bifurcation makes it very important to control the launch speed accurately. If the air resistance is removed, the bifurcation disappears and the phase-space volume distribution becomes dispersionless and shrinks in magnitude.			arxiv	[]	49.0

Yet, state-of-the-art results still suffer from errors due to challenging body poses, modeling clothing, and self occlusions. The domain of basketball games is particularly challenging, as it exhibits all of these challenges. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for reconstruction of basketball players that outperforms the state-of-the-art. Key to our approach is a new method for creating poseable, skinned models of NBA players, and a large database of meshes (derived from the NBA2K19 video game), that we are releasing to the research community. Based on these models, we introduce a new method that takes as input a single photo of a clothed player in any basketball pose and outputs a high resolution mesh and 3D pose for that player. We demonstrate substantial improvement over state-of-the-art, single-image methods for body shape reconstruction.			arxiv	['Konstantinos Rematas', 'Brian Curless', 'Steve Seitz', 'Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman']	50.0

In order to have a deep understanding of field goal attempts among different players, we propose a zero inflated Poisson model with clustered regression coefficients to learn the shooting habits of different players over the court and the heterogeneity among them. Specifically, the zero inflated model recovers the large proportion of the court with zero field goal attempts, and the mixture of finite mixtures model learn the heterogeneity among different players based on clustered regression coefficients and inflated probabilities. Both theoretical and empirical justification through simulation studies validate our proposed method. We apply our proposed model to the National Basketball Association (NBA), for learning players' shooting habits and heterogeneity among different players over the 2017--2018 regular season. This illustrates our model as a way of providing insights from different aspects.			arxiv	['Hou-Cheng Yang', 'Yishu Xue', 'Dipak K. Dey']	51.0

Recent work has explored the efficacy of traditional deep sequential models in this domain, but these architectures are slow and cumbersome to train, particularly as model size increases. Further, prior attempts to model interactions between agents across time have limitations, such as imposing an order on the agents, or making assumptions about their relationships. In this paper, we introduce baller2vec, a multi-entity generalization of the standard Transformer that can, with minimal assumptions, simultaneously and efficiently integrate information across entities and time. We test the effectiveness of baller2vec for multi-agent spatiotemporal modeling by training it to perform two different basketball-related tasks: (1) simultaneously modeling the trajectories of all players on the court and (2) modeling the trajectory of the ball. Not only does baller2vec learn to perform these tasks well (outperforming a graph recurrent neural network with a similar number of parameters by a wide margin), it also appears to ""understand"" the game of basketball, encoding idiosyncratic qualities of players in its embeddings, and performing basketball-relevant functions with its attention heads."			arxiv	['Anh Nguyen']	52.0
311	Towards an Understanding of Situated AR Visualization for Basketball Free-Throw Training	Tica Lin	2021-04-08 23:54:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04118v2	We present an observational study to compare co-located and situated real-time visualizations in basketball free-throw training. Our goal is to understand the advantages and concerns of applying immersive visualization to real-world skill-based sports training and to provide insights for designing AR sports training systems. We design both a situated 3D visualization on a head-mounted display and a 2D visualization on a co-located display to provide immediate visual feedback on a player's shot performance. Using a within-subject study design with experienced basketball shooters, we characterize user goals, report on qualitative training experiences, and compare the quantitative training results. Our results show that real-time visual feedback helps athletes refine subsequent shots. Shooters in our study achieve greater angle consistency with our visual feedback. Furthermore, AR visualization promotes an increased focus on body form in athletes. Finally, we present suggestions for the design of future sports AR studies.			arxiv	['Rishi Singh', 'Yalong Yang', 'Carolina Nobre', 'Johanna Beyer', 'Maurice A. Smith', 'Hanspeter Pfister']	53.0
312	Using Conformal Win Probability to Predict the Winners of the Cancelled 2020 NCAA Basketball Tournaments	Chancellor Johnstone	2022-08-18 02:29:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08598v1	The COVID-19 pandemic was responsible for the cancellation of both the men's and women's 2020 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division 1 basketball tournaments. Starting from the point at which the Division 1 tournaments and any unfinished conference tournaments were cancelled, we deliver closed-form probabilities for each team of making the Division 1 tournaments, had they not been cancelled, aided by use of conformal predictive distributions. We also deliver probabilities of a team winning March Madness, given a tournament bracket. We then compare single-game win probabilities generated with conformal predictive distributions, aptly named conformal win probabilities, to those generated through linear and logistic regression on seven years of historical college basketball data, specifically from the 2014-2015 season through the 2020-2021 season. Conformal win probabilities are shown to be better calibrated than other methods, resulting in more accurate win probability estimates, while requiring fewer distributional assumptions.			arxiv	['Dan Nettleton']	54.0
313	Ontology Based Global and Collective Motion Patterns for Event Classification in Basketball Videos	Lifang Wu	2019-03-16 04:52:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06879v2	In multi-person videos, especially team sport videos, a semantic event is usually represented as a confrontation between two teams of players, which can be represented as collective motion. In broadcast basketball videos, specific camera motions are used to present specific events. Therefore, a semantic event in broadcast basketball videos is closely related to both the global motion (camera motion) and the collective motion. A semantic event in basketball videos can be generally divided into three stages: pre-event, event occurrence (event-occ), and post-event. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based global and collective motion pattern (On_GCMP) algorithm for basketball event classification. First, a two-stage GCMP based event classification scheme is proposed. The GCMP is extracted using optical flow. The two-stage scheme progressively combines a five-class event classification algorithm on event-occs and a two-class event classification algorithm on pre-events. Both algorithms utilize sequential convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extract the spatial and temporal features of GCMP for event classification. Second, we utilize post-event segments to predict success/failure using deep features of images in the video frames (RGB_DF_VF) based algorithms. Finally the event classification results and success/failure classification results are integrated to obtain the final results. To evaluate the proposed scheme, we collected a new dataset called NCAA+, which is automatically obtained from the NCAA dataset by extending the fixed length of video clips forward and backward of the corresponding semantic events. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves the mean average precision of 58.10% on NCAA+. It is higher by 6.50% than state-of-the-art on NCAA.			arxiv	['Zhou Yang', 'Jiaoyu He', 'Meng Jian', 'Yaowen Xu', 'Dezhong Xu', 'Chang Wen Chen']	55.0
314	Basketball scoring in NBA games: an example of complexity	Yves de Saá Guerra	2011-08-03 08:21:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.0779v2	Scoring in a basketball game is a process highly dynamic and non-linear type. The level of NBA teams improve each season. They incorporate to their rosters the best players in the world. These and other mechanisms, make the scoring in the NBA basketball games be something exciting, where, on rare occasions, we really know what will be the result at the end of the game. We analyzed all the games of the 2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2009-10 NBA regular seasons (6150 games). We have studied the evolution of the scoring and the time intervals between points. These do not behave uniformly, but present more predictable areas. In turn, we have analyzed the scoring in the games regarding the differences in points. Exists different areas of behavior related with the scorea and each zone has a different nature. There are point that we can consider as tipping points. The presence of these critical points suggests that there are phase transitions where the dynamic scoring of the games varies significantly.			arxiv	['Juan Manuel Martín González', 'Samuel Sarmiento Montesdeoca', 'David Rodríguez Ruiz', 'Nieves Arjonilla López', 'Juan Manuel García Manso']	56.0
315	A bijective study of Basketball walks	Jérémie Bettinelli	2016-11-04 18:20:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01478v2	The Catalan numbers count many classes of combinatorial objects. The most emblematic such objects are probably the Dyck walks and the binary trees, and, whenever another class of combinatorial objects is counted by the Catalan numbers, it is natural to search for an explicit bijection between the latter objects and one of the former objects. In most cases, such a bijection happens to be relatively simple but it might sometimes be more intricate. In this work, we focus on so-called \emph{basketball walks}, which are integer-valued walks with step-set $\{-2,-1,+1,+2\}$. The presence of $-2$ as an allowed step makes it impossible to use the classical {\L}ukasiewicz encoding of trees by integer-valued walks, and thus a different strategy is needed. We give an explicit bijection that maps, for each $n\ge 2$, $n$-step basketball walks from $0$ to $0$ that visit $1$ and are positive except at their extremities to $n$-leaf binary trees. Moreover, we can partition the steps of a walk into $\pm 1$-steps, odd $+2$-steps or even $-2$-steps, and odd $-2$-steps or even $+2$-steps, and these three types of steps are mapped through our bijection to double leaves, left leaves, and right leaves of the corresponding tree. We also prove that basketball walks from $0$ to $1$ that are positive except at the origin are in bijection with increasing unary-binary trees with associated permutation avoiding $213$. We furthermore give the refined generating function of these objects with an extra variable accounting for the unary nodes.			arxiv	['Éric Fusy', 'Cécile Mailler', 'Lucas Randazzo']	57.0
316	Measuring Spatial Allocative Efficiency in Basketball	Nathan Sandholtz	2019-12-11 05:56:55	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05129v2	Every shot in basketball has an opportunity cost; one player's shot eliminates all potential opportunities from their teammates for that play. For this reason, player-shot efficiency should ultimately be considered relative to the lineup. This aspect of efficiency---the optimal way to allocate shots within a lineup---is the focus of our paper. Allocative efficiency should be considered in a spatial context since the distribution of shot attempts within a lineup is highly dependent on court location. We propose a new metric for spatial allocative efficiency by comparing a player's field goal percentage (FG%) to their field goal attempt (FGA) rate in context of both their four teammates on the court and the spatial distribution of their shots. Leveraging publicly available data provided by the National Basketball Association (NBA), we estimate player FG% at every location in the offensive half court using a Bayesian hierarchical model. Then, by ordering a lineup's estimated FG%s and pairing these rankings with the lineup's empirical FGA rate rankings, we detect areas where the lineup exhibits inefficient shot allocation. Lastly, we analyze the impact that sub-optimal shot allocation has on a team's overall offensive potential, demonstrating that inefficient shot allocation correlates with reduced scoring.			arxiv	['Jacob Mortensen', 'Luke Bornn']	58.0
317	A PageRank Model for Player Performance Assessment in Basketball, Soccer and Hockey	Shael Brown	2017-03-31 16:03:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00583v1	"In the sports of soccer, hockey and basketball the most commonly used statistics for player performance assessment are divided into two categories: offensive statistics and defensive statistics. However, qualitative assessments of playmaking (for example making ""smart"" passes) are difficult to quantify. It would be advantageous to have available a single statistic that can emphasize the flow of a game, rewarding those players who initiate and contribute to successful plays more. In this paper we will examine a model based on Google's PageRank. Other papers have explored ranking teams, coaches, and captains but here we construct ratings and rankings for individual members on both teams that emphasizes initiating and partaking in successful plays and forcing defensive turnovers. For a soccer/hockey/basketball game, our model assigns a node for each of the n players who play in the game and a ""goal node"". Arcs between player nodes indicate sport-specific situations (including passes, turnovers, scoring, fouls, out-of-bounds, play-stoppages, turnovers, missed shots, defensive plays etc.), tailored for each sport. As well, some additional arcs are added in to ensure that the associated matrix is primitive and hence there is a unique PageRank vector. The PageRank vector of the associated matrix is used to rank the players of the game. To illustrate the model, data was taken from nine NBA games played between 2014-2016. Many of the top-ranked players (in the model) in a given game had some of the most impressive traditional stat-lines. However, from the model there were surprises where some players who had impressive stat-lines had lower ranks, and others who had less impressive stat-lines had higher ranks. Overall, the model's ranking and ratings reflect more the flow of the game compared to traditional sports statistics."			arxiv	[]	59.0
318	A Bayesian marked spatial point processes model for basketball shot chart	Jieying Jiao	2019-08-15 20:16:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05745v3	The success rate of a basketball shot may be higher at locations where a player makes more shots. For a marked spatial point process, this means that the mark and the intensity are associated. We propose a Bayesian joint model for the mark and the intensity of marked point processes, where the intensity is incorporated in the mark model as a covariate. Inferences are done with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Two Bayesian model comparison criteria, the Deviance Information Criterion and the Logarithm of the Pseudo-Marginal Likelihood, were used to assess the model. The performances of the proposed methods were examined in extensive simulation studies. The proposed methods were applied to the shot charts of four players (Curry, Harden, Durant, and James) in the 2017--2018 regular season of the National Basketball Association to analyze their shot intensity in the field and the field goal percentage in detail. Application to the top 50 most frequent shooters in the season suggests that the field goal percentage and the shot intensity are positively associated for a majority of the players. The fitted parameters were used as inputs in a secondary analysis to cluster the players into different groups.			arxiv	['Guanyu Hu', 'Jun Yan']	60.0
319	A Survey on Video Action Recognition in Sports: Datasets, Methods and Applications	Fei Wu	2022-06-02 13:19:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01038v1	To understand human behaviors, action recognition based on videos is a common approach. Compared with image-based action recognition, videos provide much more information. Reducing the ambiguity of actions and in the last decade, many works focused on datasets, novel models and learning approaches have improved video action recognition to a higher level. However, there are challenges and unsolved problems, in particular in sports analytics where data collection and labeling are more sophisticated, requiring sport professionals to annotate data. In addition, the actions could be extremely fast and it becomes difficult to recognize them. Moreover, in team sports like football and basketball, one action could involve multiple players, and to correctly recognize them, we need to analyse all players, which is relatively complicated. In this paper, we present a survey on video action recognition for sports analytics. We introduce more than ten types of sports, including team sports, such as football, basketball, volleyball, hockey and individual sports, such as figure skating, gymnastics, table tennis, tennis, diving and badminton. Then we compare numerous existing frameworks for sports analysis to present status quo of video action recognition in both team sports and individual sports. Finally, we discuss the challenges and unsolved problems in this area and to facilitate sports analytics, we develop a toolbox using PaddlePaddle, which supports football, basketball, table tennis and figure skating action recognition.			arxiv	['Qingzhong Wang', 'Jian Bian', 'Haoyi Xiong', 'Ning Ding', 'Feixiang Lu', 'Jun Cheng', 'Dejing Dou']	61.0
320	Group Activity Recognition in Basketball Tracking Data -- Neural Embeddings in Team Sports (NETS)	Sandro Hauri	2022-08-31 01:22:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00451v1	Like many team sports, basketball involves two groups of players who engage in collaborative and adversarial activities to win a game. Players and teams are executing various complex strategies to gain an advantage over their opponents. Defining, identifying, and analyzing different types of activities is an important task in sports analytics, as it can lead to better strategies and decisions by the players and coaching staff. The objective of this paper is to automatically recognize basketball group activities from tracking data representing locations of players and the ball during a game. We propose a novel deep learning approach for group activity recognition (GAR) in team sports called NETS. To efficiently model the player relations in team sports, we combined a Transformer-based architecture with LSTM embedding, and a team-wise pooling layer to recognize the group activity. Training such a neural network generally requires a large amount of annotated data, which incurs high labeling cost. To address scarcity of manual labels, we generate weak-labels and pretrain the neural network on a self-supervised trajectory prediction task. We used a large tracking data set from 632 NBA games to evaluate our approach. The results show that NETS is capable of learning group activities with high accuracy, and that self- and weak-supervised training in NETS have a positive impact on GAR accuracy.			arxiv	['Slobodan Vucetic']	62.0
321	Understanding why shooters shoot -- An AI-powered engine for basketball performance profiling	Alejandro Rodriguez Pascual	2023-03-17 01:13:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09715v1	Understanding player shooting profiles is an essential part of basketball analysis: knowing where certain opposing players like to shoot from can help coaches neutralize offensive gameplans from their opponents; understanding where their players are most comfortable can lead them to developing more effective offensive strategies. An automatic tool that can provide these performance profiles in a timely manner can become invaluable for coaches to maximize both the effectiveness of their game plan as well as the time dedicated to practice and other related activities. Additionally, basketball is dictated by many variables, such as playstyle and game dynamics, that can change the flow of the game and, by extension, player performance profiles. It is crucial that the performance profiles can reflect the diverse playstyles, as well as the fast-changing dynamics of the game. We present a tool that can visualize player performance profiles in a timely manner while taking into account factors such as play-style and game dynamics. Our approach generates interpretable heatmaps that allow us to identify and analyze how non-spatial factors, such as game dynamics or playstyle, affect player performance profiles.			arxiv	['Ishan Mehta', 'Muhammad Khan', 'Frank Rodriz', 'Rose Yu']	63.0

Picoli Jr.	2003-01-28 18:16:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0301552v1	In a comparative study, the q-exponential and Weibull distributions are employed to investigate frequency distributions of basketball baskets, cyclone victims, brand-name drugs by retail sales, and highway length. In order to analyze the intermediate cases, a distribution, the q-Weibull one, which interpolates the q-exponential and Weibull ones, is introduced. It is verified that the basketball baskets distribution is well described by a q-exponential, whereas the cyclone victims and brand-name drugs by retail sales ones are better adjusted by a Weibull distribution. On the other hand, for highway length the q-exponential and Weibull distributions do not give satisfactory adjustment, being necessary to employ the q-Weibull distribution. Furthermore, the introduction of this interpolating distribution gives an illumination from the point of view of the stretched exponential against inverse power law (q-exponential with q > 1) controversy.			arxiv	['R.

325	Random Basketball Routing for ZigBee based Sensor Networks	Dong Min Kim	2013-12-20 02:35:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5794v1	Random basketball routing (BR) \cite {Hwang} is a simple protocol that integrates MAC and multihop routing in a cross-layer optimized manner. Due to its lightness and performance, BR would be quite suitable for sensor networks, where communication nodes are usually simple devices. In this paper, we describe how we implemented BR in a ZigBee-based (IEEE 802.15.4) sensor network. In \cite{Hwang}, it is verified that BR takes advantages of dynamic environments (in particular, node mobility), however, here we focus on how BR works under static situations. For implementation purposes, we add some features such as destination RSSI measuring and loop-free procedure, to the original BR. With implemented testbed, we compare the performance of BR with that of the simplified AODV with CSMA/CA. The result is that BR has merits in terms of number of hops to traverse the network. Considering the simple structure of BR and its possible energy-efficiency, we can conclude that BR can be a good candidate for sensor networks both under dynamic- and static environments.			arxiv	['Young Ju Hwang', 'Seong-Lyun Kim', 'Gwang-Ja Jin', 'Bong-Soo Kim']	67.0
326	Factorized Point Process Intensities: A Spatial Analysis of Professional Basketball	Andrew Miller	2014-01-05 21:31:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0942v2	We develop a machine learning approach to represent and analyze the underlying spatial structure that governs shot selection among professional basketball players in the NBA. Typically, NBA players are discussed and compared in an heuristic, imprecise manner that relies on unmeasured intuitions about player behavior. This makes it difficult to draw comparisons between players and make accurate player specific predictions. Modeling shot attempt data as a point process, we create a low dimensional representation of offensive player types in the NBA. Using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique, we show that a low-rank spatial decomposition summarizes the shooting habits of NBA players. The spatial representations discovered by the algorithm correspond to intuitive descriptions of NBA player types, and can be used to model other spatial effects, such as shooting accuracy.			arxiv	['Luke Bornn', 'Ryan Adams', 'Kirk Goldsberry']	68.0
327	On Optimal Offensive Strategies in Basketball	Ikjyot Singh Kohli	2015-06-22 17:17:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06687v2	The purpose of this paper is to determine whether basketball teams who choose to employ an offensive strategy that involves predominantly shooting three point shots is stable and optimal. We employ a game-theoretical approach using techniques from dynamical systems theory to show that taking more three point shots to a point where an offensive strategy is dependent on predominantly shooting threes is not necessarily optimal, and depends on a combination of payoff constraints, where one can establish conditions via the global stability of equilibrium points in addition to Nash equilibria where a predominant two-point offensive strategy would be optimal as well. We perform a detailed fixed-points analysis to establish the local stability of a given offensive strategy. We finally prove the existence of Nash equilibria via global stability techniques via the monotonicity principle. We believe that this work demonstrates that the concept that teams should attempt more three-point shots because a three-point shot is worth more than a two-point shot is therefore, a highly ambiguous statement.			arxiv	[]	69.0
328	Leveraging Contextual Cues for Generating Basketball Highlights	Vinay Bettadapura	2016-06-29 05:04:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08955v1	The massive growth of sports videos has resulted in a need for automatic generation of sports highlights that are comparable in quality to the hand-edited highlights produced by broadcasters such as ESPN. Unlike previous works that mostly use audio-visual cues derived from the video, we propose an approach that additionally leverages contextual cues derived from the environment that the game is being played in. The contextual cues provide information about the excitement levels in the game, which can be ranked and selected to automatically produce high-quality basketball highlights. We introduce a new dataset of 25 NCAA games along with their play-by-play stats and the ground-truth excitement data for each basket. We explore the informativeness of five different cues derived from the video and from the environment through user studies. Our experiments show that for our study participants, the highlights produced by our system are comparable to the ones produced by ESPN for the same games.			arxiv	['Caroline Pantofaru', 'Irfan Essa']	70.0
329	Applying Deep Learning to Basketball Trajectories	Rajiv Shah	2016-08-12 13:50:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03793v2	One of the emerging trends for sports analytics is the growing use of player and ball tracking data. A parallel development is deep learning predictive approaches that use vast quantities of data with less reliance on feature engineering. This paper applies recurrent neural networks in the form of sequence modeling to predict whether a three-point shot is successful. The models are capable of learning the trajectory of a basketball without any knowledge of physics. For comparison, a baseline static machine learning model with a full set of features, such as angle and velocity, in addition to the positional data is also tested. Using a dataset of over 20,000 three pointers from NBA SportVu data, the models based simply on sequential positional data outperform a static feature rich machine learning model in predicting whether a three-point shot is successful. This suggests deep learning models may offer an improvement to traditional feature based machine learning methods for tracking data.			arxiv	['Rob Romijnders']	71.0
330	Defensive Player Classification in the National Basketball Association	Neil Seward	2016-12-13 20:22:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05502v2	The National Basketball Association(NBA) has expanded their data gathering and have heavily invested in new technologies to gather advanced performance metrics on players. This expanded data set allows analysts to use unique performance metrics in models to estimate and classify player performance. Instead of grouping players together based on physical attributes and positions played, analysts can group together players that play similar to each other based on these tracked metrics. Existing methods for player classification have typically used offensive metrics for clustering [1]. There have been attempts to classify players using past defensive metrics, but the lack of quality metrics has not produced promising results. The classifications presented in the paper use newly introduced defensive metrics to find different defensive positions for each player. Without knowing the number of categories that players can be cast into, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) can be applied to find the optimal number of clusters. In the model presented, five different defensive player types can be identified.			arxiv	[]	72.0
331	The physics of an optimal basketball free throw	Irina Barzykina	2017-02-21 23:50:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07234v1	A physical model is developed, which suggests a pathway to determining the optimal release conditions for a basketball free throw. Theoretical framework is supported by Monte Carlo simulations and a series of free throws performed and analysed at Southbank International School. The model defines a smile-shaped success region in angle-velocity space where a free throw will score. A formula for the minimum throwing angle is derived analytically. The optimal throwing conditions are determined numerically by maximising the expected number of successful shots given the error pattern inherent to the player. This approach is fully quantified by the model presented and suggests a reliable way for individual free throw improvement. The model also explains recent NBA data showing that some of the most successful free throwers bear completely different conditions to the average player.			arxiv	[]	73.0

Case study: The Spanish ACB Basketball League	Víctor Blanco	2018-02-20 10:08:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07039v1	In this paper, we describe an approach to rank sport players based on their efficiency. Although is extremely useful to analyze the performance of team games there is no unanimity on the use of a single index to perform such a ranking. We propose a method to summarize the huge amount of information collected at different aspects of a sport team which is almost daily publicly available. The tool will allow agents involved in a player's negotiation to show the strengths (and weaknesses) of the player with respect to other players. The approach is based on applying a multicriteria outranking methodology using as alternatives the potential players and criteria different efficiency indices. A novel automatic parameter tuning approach is detailed that will allow coaches and sports managers to design templates and sports strategies that improve the efficiency of their teams. We report the results performed over the available information on the ACB Basketball League, and we show how it can be easily implemented and interpreted in practice by decision-makers non familiar with the mathematical side of the methodology.			arxiv	['Román Salmerón', 'Samuel Gómez-Haro']	74.0

However, multi-person tracking is a challenging task to solve in single-camera video sequences, given the frequent occlusions and cluttering that occur in a restricted scenario. In this paper, a novel multi-scale detection method is presented, which is later used to extract geometric and content features, resulting in a multi-person video tracking system. Having built a dataset from scratch together with its ground truth (more than 10k bounding boxes), standard metrics are evaluated, obtaining notable results both in terms of detection (F1-score) and tracking (MOTA). The presented system could be used as a source of data gathering in order to extract useful statistics and semantic analyses a posteriori.			arxiv	['Gloria Haro', 'Coloma Ballester']	75.0
334	Why Can't I Dance in the Mall? Learning to Mitigate Scene Bias in Action Recognition	Jinwoo Choi	2019-12-11 18:59:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05534v1	Human activities often occur in specific scene contexts, e.g., playing basketball on a basketball court. Training a model using existing video datasets thus inevitably captures and leverages such bias (instead of using the actual discriminative cues). The learned representation may not generalize well to new action classes or different tasks. In this paper, we propose to mitigate scene bias for video representation learning. Specifically, we augment the standard cross-entropy loss for action classification with 1) an adversarial loss for scene types and 2) a human mask confusion loss for videos where the human actors are masked out. These two losses encourage learning representations that are unable to predict the scene types and the correct actions when there is no evidence. We validate the effectiveness of our method by transferring our pre-trained model to three different tasks, including action classification, temporal localization, and spatio-temporal action detection. Our results show consistent improvement over the baseline model without debiasing.			arxiv	['Chen Gao', 'Joseph C. E. Messou', 'Jia-Bin Huang']	76.0

The study is performed with data from professional basketball (betting lines and scores) and tries to answer the question: Does the winning team always covers the point spread?. In order to answer this question, a regression analysis is performed taking into account the most and less winning teams, together with their betting variables since the 1990-1991 NBA season. The regression results are inserted in the SPXS expert system revealing an indirect factor analysis that correlates betting variables with teams winning percentages.			arxiv	[]	77.0
336	Using Cross-Model EgoSupervision to Learn Cooperative Basketball Intention	Gedas Bertasius	2017-09-05 23:49:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01630v1	We present a first-person method for cooperative basketball intention prediction: we predict with whom the camera wearer will cooperate in the near future from unlabeled first-person images. This is a challenging task that requires inferring the camera wearer's visual attention, and decoding the social cues of other players. Our key observation is that a first-person view provides strong cues to infer the camera wearer's momentary visual attention, and his/her intentions. We exploit this observation by proposing a new cross-model EgoSupervision learning scheme that allows us to predict with whom the camera wearer will cooperate in the near future, without using manually labeled intention labels. Our cross-model EgoSupervision operates by transforming the outputs of a pretrained pose-estimation network, into pseudo ground truth labels, which are then used as a supervisory signal to train a new network for a cooperative intention task. We evaluate our method, and show that it achieves similar or even better accuracy than the fully supervised methods do.			arxiv	['Jianbo Shi']	78.0
337	Players Movements and Team Shooting Performance: a Data Mining approach for Basketball	Rodolfo Metulini	2018-05-04 09:49:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02501v1	In the domain of Sport Analytics, Global Positioning Systems devices are intensively used as they permit to retrieve players' movements. Team sports' managers and coaches are interested on the relation between players' patterns of movements and team performance, in order to better manage their team. In this paper we propose a Cluster Analysis and Multidimensional Scaling approach to find and describe separate patterns of players movements. Using real data of multiple professional basketball teams, we find, consistently over different case studies, that in the defensive clusters players are close one to another while the transition cluster are characterized by a large space among them. Moreover, we find the pattern of players' positioning that produce the best shooting performance.			arxiv	[]	79.0
338	Detecting and classifying moments in basketball matches using sensor tracked data	Tullio Facchinetti	2019-06-27 15:06:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11720v1	Data analytics in sports is crucial to evaluate the performance of single players and the whole team. The literature proposes a number of tools for both offence and defence scenarios. Data coming from tracking location of players, in this respect, may be used to enrich the amount of useful information. In basketball, however, actions are interleaved with inactive periods. This paper describes a methodological approach to automatically identify active periods during a game and to classify them as offensive or defensive. The method is based on the application of thresholds to players kinematic parameters, whose values undergo a tuning strategy similar to Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, using a ground truth extracted from the video of the games.			arxiv	['Rodolfo Metulini', 'Paola Zuccolotto']	80.0
339	Bayesian Group Learning for Shot Selection of Professional Basketball Players	Guanyu Hu	2020-06-12 23:49:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07513v3	In this paper, we develop a group learning approach to analyze the underlying heterogeneity structure of shot selection among professional basketball players in the NBA. We propose a mixture of finite mixtures (MFM) model to capture the heterogeneity of shot selection among different players based on Log Gaussian Cox process (LGCP). Our proposed method can simultaneously estimate the number of groups and group configurations. An efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is developed for our proposed model. Simulation studies have been conducted to demonstrate its performance. Ultimately, our proposed learning approach is further illustrated in analyzing shot charts of several players in the NBA's 2017-2018 regular season.			arxiv	['Hou-Cheng Yang', 'Yishu Xue']	81.0
340	Prediction of the margin of victory only from team rankings for regular season games in NCAA men's basketball	David Beaudoin	2017-01-25 14:07:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07316v1	"The main objective of this paper is to investigate the extent to which the margin of victory can be predicted solely by the rankings of the opposing teams in NCAA Division I men's basketball games. Several past studies have modeled this relationship for the games played during the March Madness tournament, and this work aims at verifying if the models advocated in these papers still perform well for regular season games. Indeed, most previous articles have shown that a simple quadratic regression model provides fairly accurate predictions of the margin of victory when team rankings only range from 1 to 16. Does that still hold true when team rankings can go as high as 351? Do the model assumptions hold? Can we find semi- or non-parametric methods that yield even better results (i.e. predicted margins of victory that more closely resemble actual results)? The analyses presented in this paper suggest that the answer is ""yes"" on all three counts!"			arxiv	['Thierry Duchesne']	82.0
341	Who is the best coach of all time? A network-based assessment of the career performance of professional sports coaches	Şirag Erkol	2020-12-16 21:19:22	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09270v2	We consider two large datasets consisting of all games played among top-tier European soccer clubs in the last 60 years, and among professional American basketball teams in the past 70 years. We leverage game data to build networks of pairwise interactions between the head coaches of the teams, and measure their career performance in terms of network centrality metrics. We identify Arsene Wenger, Sir Alex Ferguson, Jupp Heynckes, Carlo Ancelotti, and Jose Mourinho as the top 5 European soccer coaches of all time. In American basketball, the first 5 positions of the all-time ranking are occupied by Red Auerbach, Gregg Popovich, Phil Jackson, Don Nelson, and Lenny Wilkens. We further establish rankings by decade and season. We develop a simple methodology to monitor performance throughout a coach's career, and to dynamically compare the performance of two or more coaches at a given time.

342	baller2vec++: A Look-Ahead Multi-Entity Transformer For Modeling Coordinated Agents	Michael A. Alcorn	2021-04-24 16:20:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11980v2	"In many multi-agent spatiotemporal systems, agents operate under the influence of shared, unobserved variables (e.g., the play a team is executing in a game of basketball). As a result, the trajectories of the agents are often statistically dependent at any given time step; however, almost universally, multi-agent models implicitly assume the agents' trajectories are statistically independent at each time step. In this paper, we introduce baller2vec++, a multi-entity Transformer that can effectively model coordinated agents. Specifically, baller2vec++ applies a specially designed self-attention mask to a mixture of location and ""look-ahead"" trajectory sequences to learn the distributions of statistically dependent agent trajectories. We show that, unlike baller2vec (baller2vec++'s predecessor), baller2vec++ can learn to emulate the behavior of perfectly coordinated agents in a simulated toy dataset. Additionally, when modeling the trajectories of professional basketball players, baller2vec++ outperforms baller2vec by a wide margin."			arxiv	['Anh Nguyen']	84.0
343	Multidimensional heterogeneity learning for count value tensor data with applications to field goal attempt analysis of NBA players	Guanyu Hu	2022-05-20 01:17:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09918v1	We propose a multidimensional tensor clustering approach for studying how professional basketball players' shooting patterns vary over court locations and game time. Unlike most existing methods that only study continuous-valued tensors or have to assume the same cluster structure along different tensor directions, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric model that deals with count-valued tensors and projects the heterogeneity among players onto tensor dimensions while allowing cluster structures to be different over directions. Our method is fully probabilistic; hence allows simultaneous inference on both the number of clusters and the cluster configurations. We present an efficient posterior sampling method and establish the large-sample convergence properties for the posterior distribution. Simulation studies have demonstrated an excellent empirical performance of the proposed method. Finally, an application to shot chart data collected from 191 NBA players during the 2017-2018 regular season is conducted and reveals several interesting insights for basketball analytics.			arxiv	['Yishu Xue', 'Weining Shen']	85.0
344	KaliCalib: A Framework for Basketball Court Registration	Adrien Maglo	2022-09-16 08:52:29	http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07795v1	Tracking the players and the ball in team sports is key to analyse the performance or to enhance the game watching experience with augmented reality. When the only sources for this data are broadcast videos, sports-field registration systems are required to estimate the homography and re-project the ball or the players from the image space to the field space. This paper describes a new basketball court registration framework in the context of the MMSports 2022 camera calibration challenge. The method is based on the estimation by an encoder-decoder network of the positions of keypoints sampled with perspective-aware constraints. The regression of the basket positions and heavy data augmentation techniques make the model robust to different arenas. Ablation studies show the positive effects of our contributions on the challenge test set. Our method divides the mean squared error by 4.7 compared to the challenge baseline.			arxiv	['Astrid Orcesi', 'Quoc Cuong Pham']	86.0
345	Exploring Euroleague History using Basic Statistics	Christos Katris	2023-01-06 10:04:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02443v3	In this paper are used historical statistical data to track the evolution of the game in the European-wide top-tier level professional basketball club competition (until 2017-2018 season) and also are answered questions by analyzing them. The term basic is referred because of the nature of the data (not available detailed statistics) and of the level of aggregation (not disaggregation to individual level). We are examining themes such as the dominance per geographic area, the level of the competition in the game, the evolution of scoring pluralism and possessions in the finals, the effect of a top scorer in the performance of a team and the existence of unexpected outcomes in final fours. For each theme under consideration, available statistical data is specified and suitable statistical analysis is applied. The analysis allows us to handle and answer the above themes and interesting conclusions are drawn. This paper can be an example of statistical thinking in basketball problems by the means of using efficiently available statistical data.			arxiv	[]	87.0
346	Uncertainty in the Hot Hand Fallacy: Detecting Streaky Alternatives to Random Bernoulli Sequences	David M. Ritzwoller	2019-08-04 21:49:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01406v6	We study a class of permutation tests of the randomness of a collection of Bernoulli sequences and their application to analyses of the human tendency to perceive streaks of consecutive successes as overly representative of positive dependence - the hot hand fallacy. In particular, we study permutation tests of the null hypothesis of randomness (i.e., that trials are i.i.d.) based on test statistics that compare the proportion of successes that directly follow k consecutive successes with either the overall proportion of successes or the proportion of successes that directly follow k consecutive failures. We characterize the asymptotic distributions of these test statistics and their permutation distributions under randomness, under a set of general stationary processes, and under a class of Markov chain alternatives, which allow us to derive their local asymptotic power. The results are applied to evaluate the empirical support for the hot hand fallacy provided by four controlled basketball shooting experiments. We establish that substantially larger data sets are required to derive an informative measurement of the deviation from randomness in basketball shooting. In one experiment, for which we were able to obtain data, multiple testing procedures reveal that one shooter exhibits a shooting pattern significantly inconsistent with randomness - supplying strong evidence that basketball shooting is not random for all shooters all of the time. However, we find that the evidence against randomness in this experiment is limited to this shooter. Our results provide a mathematical and statistical foundation for the design and validation of experiments that directly compare deviations from randomness with human beliefs about deviations from randomness, and thereby constitute a direct test of the hot hand fallacy.			arxiv	['Joseph P.

347	tHoops: A Multi-Aspect Analytical Framework Spatio-Temporal Basketball Data	Evangelos Papalexakis	2017-12-04 17:06:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01199v5	During the past few years advancements in sports information systems and technology has allowed us to collect a number of detailed spatio-temporal data capturing various aspects of basketball. For example, shot charts, that is, maps capturing locations of (made or missed) shots, and spatio-temporal trajectories for all the players on the court can capture information about the offensive and defensive tendencies and schemes of a team. Characterization of these processes is important for player and team comparisons, pre-game scouting, game preparation etc. Playing tendencies among teams have traditionally been compared in a heuristic manner. Recently automated ways for similar comparisons have appeared in the sports analytics literature. However, these approaches are almost exclusively focused on the spatial distribution of the underlying actions (usually shots taken), ignoring a multitude of other parameters that can affect the action studied. In this work, we propose a framework based on tensor decomposition for obtaining a set of prototype spatio-temporal patterns based on the core spatiotemporal information and contextual meta-data. The core of our framework is a 3D tensor X, whose dimensions represent the entity under consideration (team, player, possession etc.), the location on the court and time. We make use of the PARAFAC decomposition and we decompose the tensor into several interpretable patterns, that can be thought of as prototype patterns of the process examined (e.g., shot selection, offensive schemes etc.). We also introduce an approach for choosing the number of components to be considered. Using the tensor components, we can then express every entity as a weighted combination of these components. The framework introduced in this paper can have further applications in the work-flow of the basketball operations of a franchise, which we also briefly discuss.			arxiv	['Konstantinos Pelechrinis']	89.0

Two Phi-derivable approximations including scattering effects are used: the two-loop and the ``basketball'', the latter corresponding to the truncation of the 2PI effective action at O(lambda^2). The approach to equilibrium, as well as the kinetic and chemical equilibration is investigated.			arxiv	['Jan Smit', 'Anders Tranberg']	90.0

The rapidly grown amount of collected sports data now allow to support such discussions with state of the art statistical methodology. Given a (multivariate) data set with collected data of athletes within a specific sport, outstanding athletes are values on the data set boundary. In the present paper we propose archetypal analysis to compute these extreme values. The so-called archetypes, i.e., archetypal athletes, approximate the observations as convex combinations. We interpret the archetypal athletes and their characteristics, and, furthermore, the composition of all athletes based on the archetypal athletes. The application of archetypal analysis is demonstrated on basketball statistics and soccer skill ratings.			arxiv	[]	94.0

However, it is difficult, especially in low-resolution images, due to the small size of the ball, its speed that creates motion blur, and its often being occluded by players. In this paper, we propose a generic and principled approach to modeling the interaction between the ball and the players while also imposing appropriate physical constraints on the ball's trajectory. We show that our approach, formulated in terms of a Mixed Integer Program, is more robust and more accurate than several state-of-the-art approaches on real-life volleyball, basketball, and soccer sequences.			arxiv	['Xinchao Wang', 'Pascal Fua']	96.0

Our model uses all scoring data from all games to produce a functional rating by the method of least squares. The functional rating can be interpreted as a teams average point differential adjusted for strength of schedule. Using two team's functional ratings we can predict the expected point differential at any time in the game. We looked at three variations of our model accounting for home-court advantage in different ways. We use the 2018-2019 NCAA Division 1 men's college basketball season to test the models and determined that home-court advantage is statistically important but does not differ between teams.			arxiv	['Abigail Slater', 'Kaison Thies']	99.0

The generalized distributions can have one or two more parameters than the parent distribution. Those derived from binomial, Poisson and negative binomial distributions can be underdispersed or overdispersed. The mean can be simply expressed in terms of model parameters, thus making inference for the mean straightforward. Probabilities can be quickly computed, enabling likelihood-based inference. Random number generation is also straightforward. The properties of some of the new distributions are described and their use is illustrated with examples.			arxiv	[]	101.0

The method is based on finding a suitable representation of points by fuzzy affiliations with respect to landmark points using the Scalable Probabilistic Approximation algorithm. This is followed by the construction of a linear mapping between these affiliations for different variables and forward in time. This linear mapping can be directly interpreted in light of unidirectional dependencies and relevant properties of it are quantified. These quantifications then serve as measures for the influences between variables of the dynamics. The validity of the method is demonstrated with theoretical results and on several numerical examples, including real-world basketball player movement.			arxiv	[]	105.0

367	Adjusted Plus-Minus for NHL Players using Ridge Regression with Goals, Shots, Fenwick, and Corsi	Brian Macdonald	2012-01-01 00:13:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0317v2	Regression-based adjusted plus-minus statistics were developed in basketball and have recently come to hockey. The purpose of these statistics is to provide an estimate of each player's contribution to his team, independent of the strength of his teammates, the strength of his opponents, and other variables that are out of his control. One of the main downsides of the ordinary least squares regression models is that the estimates have large error bounds. Since certain pairs of teammates play together frequently, collinearity is present in the data and is one reason for the large errors. In hockey, the relative lack of scoring compared to basketball is another reason. To deal with these issues, we use ridge regression, a method that is commonly used in lieu of ordinary least squares regression when collinearity is present in the data. We also create models that use not only goals, but also shots, Fenwick rating (shots plus missed shots), and Corsi rating (shots, missed shots, and blocked shots). One benefit of using these statistics is that there are roughly ten times as many shots as goals, so there is much more data when using these statistics and the resulting estimates have smaller error bounds. The results of our ridge regression models are estimates of the offensive and defensive contributions of forwards and defensemen during even strength, power play, and short handed situations, in terms of goals per 60 minutes. The estimates are independent of strength of teammates, strength of opponents, and the zone in which a player's shift begins.			arxiv	[]	109.0
368	Predictions Based on the Clustering of Heterogeneous Functions via Shape and Subject-Specific Covariates	Garritt L. Page	2015-05-11 12:47:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02589v1	We consider a study of players employed by teams who are members of the National Basketball Association where units of observation are functional curves that are realizations of production measurements taken through the course of one's career. The observed functional output displays large amounts of between player heterogeneity in the sense that some individuals produce curves that are fairly smooth while others are (much) more erratic. We argue that this variability in curve shape is a feature that can be exploited to guide decision making, learn about processes under study and improve prediction. In this paper we develop a methodology that takes advantage of this feature when clustering functional curves. Individual curves are flexibly modeled using Bayesian penalized B-splines while a hierarchical structure allows the clustering to be guided by the smoothness of individual curves. In a sense, the hierarchical structure balances the desire to fit individual curves well while still producing meaningful clusters that are used to guide prediction. We seamlessly incorporate available covariate information to guide the clustering of curves non-parametrically through the use of a product partition model prior for a random partition of individuals. Clustering based on curve smoothness and subject-specific covariate information is particularly important in carrying out the two types of predictions that are of interest, those that complete a partially observed curve from an active player, and those that predict the entire career curve for a player yet to play in the National Basketball Association.			arxiv	['Fernando A.

369	Detecting events and key actors in multi-person videos	Vignesh Ramanathan	2015-11-09 22:30:19	http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02917v2	"Multi-person event recognition is a challenging task, often with many people active in the scene but only a small subset contributing to an actual event. In this paper, we propose a model which learns to detect events in such videos while automatically ""attending"" to the people responsible for the event. Our model does not use explicit annotations regarding who or where those people are during training and testing. In particular, we track people in videos and use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to represent the track features. We learn time-varying attention weights to combine these features at each time-instant. The attended features are then processed using another RNN for event detection/classification. Since most video datasets with multiple people are restricted to a small number of videos, we also collected a new basketball dataset comprising 257 basketball games with 14K event annotations corresponding to 11 event classes. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both event classification and detection on this new dataset. Additionally, we show that the attention mechanism is able to consistently localize the relevant players."			arxiv	['Jonathan Huang', 'Sami Abu-El-Haija', 'Alexander Gorban', 'Kevin Murphy', 'Li Fei-Fei']	111.0

We first discuss the case of walks on the integers with steps $-h, \dots, -1, +1, \dots, +h$. The case $h=1$ is equivalent to the classical Dyck paths, for which many ways of getting explicit formulas involving Catalan-like numbers are known. The case $h=2$ corresponds to ""basketball"" walks, which we treat in full detail. Then we move on to the more general case of walks with any finite set of steps, also allowing some weights/probabilities associated with each step. We show how a method of wide applicability, the so-called ""kernel method"", leads to explicit formulas for the number of walks of length $n$, for any $h$, in terms of nested sums of binomials. We finally relate some special cases to other combinatorial problems, or to problems arising in queuing theory."			arxiv	['Christian Krattenthaler', 'Alan Krinik', 'Dmitry Kruchinin', 'Vladimir Kruchinin', 'David Tuan Nguyen', 'Michael Wallner']	112.0
371	Bayesian inferences on uncertain ranks and orderings: Application to ranking players and lineups	Andres F. Barrientos	2019-07-10 17:41:55	http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04842v4	It is common to be interested in rankings or order relationships among entities. In complex settings where one does not directly measure a univariate statistic upon which to base ranks, such inferences typically rely on statistical models having entity-specific parameters. These can be treated as random effects in hierarchical models characterizing variation among the entities. In this paper, we are particularly interested in the problem of ranking basketball players in terms of their contribution to team performance. Using data from the United States National Basketball Association (NBA), we find that many players have similar latent ability levels, making any single estimated ranking highly misleading. The current literature fails to provide summaries of order relationships that adequately account for uncertainty. Motivated by this, we propose a Bayesian strategy for characterizing uncertainty in inferences on order relationships among players and lineups. Our approach adapts to scenarios in which uncertainty in ordering is high by producing more conservative results that improve interpretability. This is achieved through a reward function within a decision theoretic framework. We apply our approach to data from the 2009-10 NBA season.			arxiv	['Deborshee Sen', 'Garritt L Page', 'David B Dunson']	113.0
372	A Nonparametric Bayesian Methodology for Regression Discontinuity Designs	Zach Branson	2017-04-17 03:22:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04858v5	One of the most popular methodologies for estimating the average treatment effect at the threshold in a regression discontinuity design is local linear regression (LLR), which places larger weight on units closer to the threshold. We propose a Gaussian process regression methodology that acts as a Bayesian analog to LLR for regression discontinuity designs. Our methodology provides a flexible fit for treatment and control responses by placing a general prior on the mean response functions. Furthermore, unlike LLR, our methodology can incorporate uncertainty in how units are weighted when estimating the treatment effect. We prove our method is consistent in estimating the average treatment effect at the threshold. Furthermore, we find via simulation that our method exhibits promising coverage, interval length, and mean squared error properties compared to standard LLR and state-of-the-art LLR methodologies. Finally, we explore the performance of our method on a real-world example by studying the impact of being a first-round draft pick on the performance and playing time of basketball players in the National Basketball Association.			arxiv	['Maxime Rischard', 'Luke Bornn', 'Luke Miratrix']	114.0
373	PersonRank: Detecting Important People in Images	Wei-Hong Li	2017-11-06 16:09:50	http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01984v1	Always, some individuals in images are more important/attractive than others in some events such as presentation, basketball game or speech. However, it is challenging to find important people among all individuals in images directly based on their spatial or appearance information due to the existence of diverse variations of pose, action, appearance of persons and various changes of occasions. We overcome this difficulty by constructing a multiple Hyper-Interaction Graph to treat each individual in an image as a node and inferring the most active node referring to interactions estimated by various types of clews. We model pairwise interactions between persons as the edge message communicated between nodes, resulting in a bidirectional pairwise-interaction graph. To enrich the personperson interaction estimation, we further introduce a unidirectional hyper-interaction graph that models the consensus of interaction between a focal person and any person in a local region around. Finally, we modify the PageRank algorithm to infer the activeness of persons on the multiple Hybrid-Interaction Graph (HIG), the union of the pairwise-interaction and hyperinteraction graphs, and we call our algorithm the PersonRank. In order to provide publicable datasets for evaluation, we have contributed a new dataset called Multi-scene Important People Image Dataset and gathered a NCAA Basketball Image Dataset from sports game sequences. We have demonstrated that the proposed PersonRank outperforms related methods clearly and substantially.			arxiv	['Benchao Li', 'Wei-Shi Zheng']	115.0

How much is a backdoor cut away from the ball worth? Basketball is one of a number of sports which, within the past decade, have seen an explosion in quantitative metrics and methods for evaluating players and teams. However, it is still challenging to evaluate individual off-ball events in terms of how they contribute to the success of a possession. In this study, we develop an end-to-end deep learning architecture DeepHoops to process a unique dataset composed of spatio-temporal tracking data from NBA games in order to generate a running stream of predictions on the expected points to be scored as a possession progresses. We frame the problem as a multi-class sequence classification problem in which our model estimates probabilities of terminal actions taken by players (e.g. take field goal, turnover, foul etc.) at each moment of a possession based on a sequence of ball and player court locations preceding the said moment. Each of these terminal actions is associated with an expected point value, which is used to estimate the expected points to be scored. One of the challenges associated with this problem is the high imbalance in the action classes. To solve this problem, we parameterize a downsampling scheme for the training phase. We demonstrate that DeepHoops is well-calibrated, estimating accurately the probabilities of each terminal action and we further showcase the model's capability to evaluate individual actions (potentially off-ball) within a possession that are not captured by boxscore statistics.			arxiv	['Konstantinos Pelechrinis', 'Kirk Goldsberry']	116.0

Comparing the Information Content of Games in the Four Major US Sports	Julian Wolfson	2015-01-28 16:31:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07179v1	"In the four major North American professional sports (baseball, basketball, football, and hockey), the primary purpose of the regular season is to determine which teams most deserve to advance to the playoffs. Interestingly, while the ultimate goal of identifying the best teams is the same, the number of regular season games played differs dramatically between the sports, ranging from 16 (football) to 82 (basketball and hockey) to 162 (baseball). Though length of season is partially determined by many factors including travel logistics, rest requirements, playoff structure and television contracts, it is hard to reconcile the 10-fold difference in the number of games between, for example, the NFL and MLB unless football games are somehow more ""informative"" than baseball games. In this paper, we aim to quantify the amount of information games yield about the relative strength of the teams involved. Our strategy is to assess how well simple paired comparison models fitted from $X%$ of the games within a season predict the outcomes of the remaining $(100-X)%$ of games, for multiple values of $X$. We compare the resulting predictive accuracy curves between seasons within the same sport and across all four sports, and find dramatic differences in the amount of information yielded by individual game results in the four major U.S. sports."			arxiv	['Joseph S.

Between the 2011-2012 and 2015-2016 seasons, NCAA teams performed better at home compared to on the road in nearly all box score statistics across both genders and all three divisions. Using box score data from over 100,000 games spanning the three divisions for both women and men, we examine the factors underlying this discrepancy. The prevalence of neutral location games in the NCAA provides an additional angle through which to examine the gaps in box score statistic performance, which we believe has been underutilized in existing literature. We also estimate a regression model to quantify the home court advantages for box score statistics after controlling for other factors such as number of possessions, and team strength. Additionally, we examine the biases of scorekeepers and referees. We present evidence that scorekeepers tend to have greater home team biases when observing men compared to women, higher divisions compared to lower divisions, and stronger teams compared to weaker teams. Finally, we present statistically significant results indicating referee decisions are impacted by attendance, with larger crowds resulting in greater bias in favor of the home team.			arxiv	['Luke Bornn', 'Peter Chow-White', 'Chuancong Gao']	118.0

Parity policies by powerful regulators don't prevent capture	Adam Sawyer	2020-09-21 16:14:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09990v2	"Much of modern society is founded on orchestrating institutions that produce social goods by fostering motivated teams, pitting them against each other, and distributing the fruits of the arms races that ensue. However, even when the ""market maker"" is willing and able to maintain parity between teams, it may fail to maintain a level playing field, as some teams acquire enough advantage within the system to gain influence over it and institutionalize their advantage. Using outcomes of over 60,000 games from four professional basketball leagues and more than 100 years' worth of seasons, we compute the evolving rate of transitivity violations (A>B, B>C, but C>A) to measure the ability of leagues to maintain parity between teams, and support the efficient generation and distribution of innovation. Comparing against a baseline of randomly permuted outcomes, we find that basketball has become less competitive over time, suggesting that teams diverge in performance, and reflecting a possible failure of market makers to tame their overpowered teams. Our results suggest that rich-get-richer dynamics are so pernicious that they can even emerge under the watch of a powerful administrator that is motivated to prevent them."			arxiv	['Seth Frey']	119.0

For example, to generate the sentence ""a man is shooting a basketball"", we need to first locate and describe the subject ""man"", next reason out the man is ""shooting"", then describe the object ""basketball"" of shooting. However, existing visual reasoning methods designed for visual question answering are not appropriate to video captioning, for it requires more complex visual reasoning on videos over both space and time, and dynamic module composition along the generation process. In this paper, we propose a novel visual reasoning approach for video captioning, named Reasoning Module Networks (RMN), to equip the existing encoder-decoder framework with the above reasoning capacity. Specifically, our RMN employs 1) three sophisticated spatio-temporal reasoning modules, and 2) a dynamic and discrete module selector trained by a linguistic loss with a Gumbel approximation. Extensive experiments on MSVD and MSR-VTT datasets demonstrate the proposed RMN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods while providing an explicit and explainable generation process.

Bartz	2020-07-29 18:00:01	http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15005v2	"In the classroom demonstration of a tennis ball dropped on top of a basketball, the surprisingly high bounce of the tennis ball is typically explained using momentum conservation for elastic collisions, with the basketball-floor collision treated as independent from the collision between the two balls. This textbook explanation is extended to inelastic collisions by including a coefficient of restitution. This independent contact model (ICM), as reviewed in this paper, is accurate for a wide variety of cases, even when the collisions are not truly independent. However, it is easy to explore situations that are not explained by the ICM, such as swapping the tennis ball for a ping-pong ball. In this paper, we study the conditions that lead to a ""delayed rebound effect,"" a small first bounce followed by a higher second bounce, using techniques accessible to an undergraduate student. The dynamical model is based on the familiar solution of the damped harmonic oscillator. We focus on making the equations of motion dimensionless for numerical simulation, and reducing the number of parameters and initial conditions to emphasize universal behavior. The delayed rebound effect is found for a range of parameters, most commonly in cases where the first bounce is lower than the ICM prediction."			arxiv	[]	121.0
380	Ball 3D Localization From A Single Calibrated Image	Gabriel Van Zandycke	2022-03-30 19:38:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00003v3	Ball 3D localization in team sports has various applications including automatic offside detection in soccer, or shot release localization in basketball. Today, this task is either resolved by using expensive multi-views setups, or by restricting the analysis to ballistic trajectories. In this work, we propose to address the task on a single image from a calibrated monocular camera by estimating ball diameter in pixels and use the knowledge of real ball diameter in meters. This approach is suitable for any game situation where the ball is (even partly) visible. To achieve this, we use a small neural network trained on image patches around candidates generated by a conventional ball detector. Besides predicting ball diameter, our network outputs the confidence of having a ball in the image patch. Validations on 3 basketball datasets reveals that our model gives remarkable predictions on ball 3D localization. In addition, through its confidence output, our model improves the detection rate by filtering the candidates produced by the detector. The contributions of this work are (i) the first model to address 3D ball localization on a single image, (ii) an effective method for ball 3D annotation from single calibrated images, (iii) a high quality 3D ball evaluation dataset annotated from a single viewpoint.

This task finds another important application in sports analytics and, in this work, we present a novel method for 3D basketball localization from a single calibrated image. Our approach predicts the object's height in pixels in image space by estimating its projection onto the ground plane within the image, leveraging the image itself and the object's location as inputs. The 3D coordinates of the ball are then reconstructed by exploiting the known projection matrix. Extensive experiments on the public DeepSport dataset, which provides ground truth annotations for 3D ball location alongside camera calibration information for each image, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, offering substantial accuracy improvements compared to recent work. Our work opens up new possibilities for enhanced ball tracking and understanding, advancing computer vision in diverse domains.

Enabling a humanoid to learn human-object interaction (HOI) is a key step for future smart animation and intelligent robotics systems. However, recent progress in physics-based HOI requires carefully designed task-specific rewards, making the system unscalable and labor-intensive. This work focuses on dynamic HOI imitation: teaching humanoid dynamic interaction skills through imitating kinematic HOI demonstrations. It is quite challenging because of the complexity of the interaction between body parts and objects and the lack of dynamic HOI data. To handle the above issues, we present PhysHOI, the first physics-based whole-body HOI imitation approach without task-specific reward designs. Except for the kinematic HOI representations of humans and objects, we introduce the contact graph to model the contact relations between body parts and objects explicitly. A contact graph reward is also designed, which proved to be critical for precise HOI imitation. Based on the key designs, PhysHOI can imitate diverse HOI tasks simply yet effectively without prior knowledge. To make up for the lack of dynamic HOI scenarios in this area, we introduce the BallPlay dataset that contains eight whole-body basketball skills. We validate PhysHOI on diverse HOI tasks, including whole-body grasping and basketball skills.			arxiv	['Jing Lin', 'Ailing Zeng', 'Zhengyi Luo', 'Jian Zhang', 'Lei Zhang']	124.0

This model takes in an arbitrary user input and provides segmentation masks of the corresponding objects. It is our goal to develop a version of SAM that is appropriate for use in a photography app. The original SAM model has a few challenges in this setting. First, original SAM a 600 million parameter based on ViT-H, and its high computational cost and large model size that are not suitable for todays mobile hardware. We address this by proposing the SqueezeSAM model architecture, which is 50x faster and 100x smaller than SAM. Next, when a user takes a photo on their phone, it might not occur to them to click on the image and get a mask. Our solution is to use salient object detection to generate the first few clicks. This produces an initial segmentation mask that the user can interactively edit. Finally, when a user clicks on an object, they typically expect all related pieces of the object to be segmented. For instance, if a user clicks on a person t-shirt in a photo, they expect the whole person to be segmented, but SAM typically segments just the t-shirt. We address this with a new data augmentation scheme, and the end result is that if the user clicks on a person holding a basketball, the person and the basketball are all segmented together.			arxiv	['Bilge Soran', 'Forrest Iandola', 'Xiaoyu Xiang', 'Yunyang Xiong', 'Lemeng Wu', 'Chenchen Zhu', 'Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi', 'Vikas Chandra']	125.0
384	A New Framework to Estimate Return on Investment for Player Salaries in the National Basketball Association	Jackson P. Lautier	2023-09-11 19:30:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05783v1	The National Basketball Association (NBA) imposes a player salary cap. It is therefore useful to develop tools to measure the relative realized return of a player's salary given their on court performance. Very few such studies exist, however. We thus present the first known framework to estimate a return on investment (ROI) for NBA player contracts. The framework operates in five parts: (1) decide on a measurement time horizon, such as the standard 82-game NBA regular season; (2) calculate the novel game contribution percentage (GCP) measure we propose, which is a single game summary statistic that sums to unity for each competing team and is comprised of traditional, playtype, hustle, box outs, defensive, tracking, and rebounding per game NBA statistics; (3) estimate the single game value (SGV) of each regular season NBA game using a standard currency conversion calculation; (4) multiply the SGV by the vector of realized GCPs to obtain a series of realized per-player single season cash flows; and (5) use the player salary as an initial investment to perform the traditional ROI calculation. We illustrate our framework by compiling a novel, sharable dataset of per game GCP statistics and salaries for the 2022-2023 NBA regular season. A scatter plot of ROI by salary for all players is presented, including the top and bottom 50 performers. Notably, missed games are treated as defaults because GCP is a per game metric. This allows for break-even calculations between high-performing players with frequent missed games and average performers with few missed games, which we demonstrate with a comparison of the 2023 NBA regular seasons of Anthony Davis and Brook Lopez. We conclude by suggesting uses of our framework, discussing its flexibility through customization, and outlining potential future improvements.			arxiv	[]	126.0

In our model, the outcome of each match is stochastic: the weaker player wins with upset probability q<=1/2, and the stronger player wins with probability 1-q. The loser is eliminated. Extremal statistics of the initial distribution of player strengths governs the tournament outcome. For a uniform initial distribution of strengths, the rank of the winner, x_*, decays algebraically with the number of players, N, as x_* ~ N^(-beta). Different decay exponents are found analytically for sequential dynamics, beta_seq=1-2q, and parallel dynamics, beta_par=1+[ln (1-q)]/[ln 2]. The distribution of player strengths becomes self-similar in the long time limit with an algebraic tail. Our theory successfully describes statistics of the US college basketball national championship tournament.			arxiv	['S. Redner', 'F. Vazquez']	127.0

In many domains, there is additional information that can assist in prediction. For example, when modeling movie ratings, we might know when the rating occurred, where the user lives, or what actors appear in the movie. It is difficult, however, to incorporate this side information into the PMF model. We propose a framework for incorporating side information by coupling together multiple PMF problems via Gaussian process priors. We replace scalar latent features with functions that vary over the space of side information. The GP priors on these functions require them to vary smoothly and share information. We successfully use this new method to predict the scores of professional basketball games, where side information about the venue and date of the game are relevant for the outcome.			arxiv	['George E.

They represent the elite of an often very large amount of entities---persons, companies, products, countries etc. Beyond their practical use as static rankings, changes to them are particularly interesting---for decision making processes, as input to common media or novel narrative science applications, or simply consumed by users. In this work, we aim at detecting events that can be characterized by changes to a Hall of Fame ranking in an automated way. We describe how the schema and data of a database can be used to generate Halls of Fame. In this database scenario, by Hall of Fame we refer to distinguished tuples; entities, whose characteristics set them apart from the majority. We define every Hall of Fame as one specific instance of an SQL query, such that a change in its result is considered a noteworthy event. Identified changes (i.e., events) are ranked using lexicographic tradeoffs over event and query properties and presented to users or fed in higher-level applications. We have implemented a full-fledged prototype system that uses either database triggers or a Java based middleware for event identification. We report on an experimental evaluation using a real-world dataset of basketball statistics.			arxiv	['Sebastian Michel', 'Aleksandar Stupar']	130.0

Thus, there is great interest in quantitatively understanding the impact of each player. In this paper we develop a new penalized regression model for the NBA, use cross-validation to select its tuning parameters, and then use it to produce ratings of player ability. We then apply the model to the 2010-2011 NBA season to predict the outcome of games. We compare the performance of our procedure to other known regression techniques for this problem, and demonstrate empirically that our model produces substantially better predictions. We evaluate the performance of our procedure against the Las Vegas gambling lines, and show that with a sufficiently large number of games to train on our model outperforms those lines. Finally, we demonstrate how the technique developed in this paper can be used to quantitively identify ""overrated"" players who are less impactful than common wisdom might suggest."			arxiv	[]	131.0
390	Scoring dynamics across professional team sports: tempo, balance and predictability	Sears Merritt	2013-10-16 17:44:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4461v2	Despite growing interest in quantifying and modeling the scoring dynamics within professional sports games, relative little is known about what patterns or principles, if any, cut across different sports. Using a comprehensive data set of scoring events in nearly a dozen consecutive seasons of college and professional (American) football, professional hockey, and professional basketball, we identify several common patterns in scoring dynamics. Across these sports, scoring tempo---when scoring events occur---closely follows a common Poisson process, with a sport-specific rate. Similarly, scoring balance---how often a team wins an event---follows a common Bernoulli process, with a parameter that effectively varies with the size of the lead. Combining these processes within a generative model of gameplay, we find they both reproduce the observed dynamics in all four sports and accurately predict game outcomes. These results demonstrate common dynamical patterns underlying within-game scoring dynamics across professional team sports, and suggest specific mechanisms for driving them. We close with a brief discussion of the implications of our results for several popular hypotheses about sports dynamics.			arxiv	['Aaron Clauset']	132.0

State of the art object tracking systems now produce spatio-temporal traces of player trajectories with high definition and high frequency, and this, in turn, has facilitated a variety of research efforts, across many disciplines, to extract insight from the trajectories. We survey recent research efforts that use spatio-temporal data from team sports as input, and involve non-trivial computation.

Some of these statistics are subjective in nature and since box score statistics are recorded by scorekeepers hired by the home team for each game, there exists potential for inconsistency and bias. These inconsistencies can have far reaching consequences, particularly with the rise in popularity of daily fantasy sports. Using box score data, we estimate models able to quantify both the bias and the generosity of each scorekeeper for two of the most subjective statistics: assists and blocks. We then use optical player tracking data for the 2014-2015 season to improve the assist model by including other contextual spatio-temporal variables such as time of possession, player locations, and distance traveled.

Results for adjusting season assist totals to remove scorekeeper influence are also presented.			arxiv	['Luke Bornn']	135.0
394	Soccer Field Localization from a Single Image	Namdar Homayounfar	2016-04-10 17:09:55	http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02715v1	In this work, we propose a novel way of efficiently localizing a soccer field from a single broadcast image of the game. Related work in this area relies on manually annotating a few key frames and extending the localization to similar images, or installing fixed specialized cameras in the stadium from which the layout of the field can be obtained. In contrast, we formulate this problem as a branch and bound inference in a Markov random field where an energy function is defined in terms of field cues such as grass, lines and circles. Moreover, our approach is fully automatic and depends only on single images from the broadcast video of the game. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to various games and obtain promising results. Finally, we posit that our approach can be applied easily to other sports such as hockey and basketball.			arxiv	['Sanja Fidler', 'Raquel Urtasun']	136.0

Although the problem of arbitrage-free pricing, while maintaining a bound on the subsidy provided by the market maker, is #P-hard in the worst case, we posit that the typical case might be amenable to modern integer programming (IP) solvers. At the crux of our method is the Frank-Wolfe (conditional gradient) algorithm which is used to implement a Bregman projection aligned with the market maker's cost function, using an IP solver as an oracle. We demonstrate the tractability and improved accuracy of our approach on real-world prediction market data from combinatorial bets placed on the 2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, where the outcome space is of size 2^63. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation and empirical evaluation of an arbitrage-free combinatorial prediction market on this scale.			arxiv	['Miroslav Dudík', 'Sébastien Lahaie', 'Sivaraman Balakrishnan']	137.0

Unlike in another common form of competition where two contestants play a head-to-head match to produce a winner as in football or basketball, the objectivity of judges are prone to be questioned, potentially undermining the public's trust in the fairness of the competition. In this work we show, by modeling the judge--contestant competition as a weighted bipartite network, how we can identify biased scores and measure their impact on our inference of the network structure. Analyzing the prestigious International Chopin Piano Competition of 2015 with a well-publicized scoring controversy as an example, we show that even a single statistically uncharacteristic score can be enough to gravely distort our inference of the community structure, demonstrating the importance of detecting and eliminating biases. In the process we also find that there does not exist a significant system-wide bias of the judges based on the the race of the contestants.			arxiv	['Juyong Park']	138.0

State of the art tracking systems now produce spatio-temporal traces of player trajectories with high definition and frequency that has facilitated a variety of research efforts to extract insight from the trajectories. Despite many methods borrowed from different disciplines (machine learning, network and complex systems, GIS, computer vision, statistics) has been proposed to answer to the needs of teams, a friendly and easy-to-use approach to visualize spatio-temporal movements is still missing. This paper suggests the use of gvisMotionChart function in GoogleVis R package. I present and discuss results of a basketball case study. Data refers to a match played by an italian team militant in ""C-gold"" league on March 22nd, 2016.

398	Social Behavior Prediction from First Person Videos	Shan Su	2016-11-29 03:04:41	http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09464v1	This paper presents a method to predict the future movements (location and gaze direction) of basketball players as a whole from their first person videos. The predicted behaviors reflect an individual physical space that affords to take the next actions while conforming to social behaviors by engaging to joint attention. Our key innovation is to use the 3D reconstruction of multiple first person cameras to automatically annotate each other's the visual semantics of social configurations. We leverage two learning signals uniquely embedded in first person videos. Individually, a first person video records the visual semantics of a spatial and social layout around a person that allows associating with past similar situations. Collectively, first person videos follow joint attention that can link the individuals to a group. We learn the egocentric visual semantics of group movements using a Siamese neural network to retrieve future trajectories. We consolidate the retrieved trajectories from all players by maximizing a measure of social compatibility---the gaze alignment towards joint attention predicted by their social formation, where the dynamics of joint attention is learned by a long-term recurrent convolutional network. This allows us to characterize which social configuration is more plausible and predict future group trajectories.			arxiv	['Jung Pyo Hong', 'Jianbo Shi', 'Hyun Soo Park']	140.0

We propose an end-to-end approach for learning person trajectory representations for group activity analysis. The learned representations encode rich spatio-temporal dependencies and capture useful motion patterns for recognizing individual events, as well as characteristic group dynamics that can be used to identify groups from their trajectories alone. We develop our deep learning approach in the context of team sports, which provide well-defined sets of events (e.g. pass, shot) and groups of people (teams). Analysis of events and team formations using NHL hockey and NBA basketball datasets demonstrate the generality of our approach.			arxiv	['Yatao Zhong', 'Frederick Tung', 'Luke Bornn', 'Greg Mori']	141.0

We first describe the standard plus-minus methodology as used in basketball and ice-hockey and then adapt it for use in soccer. The usual goal-differential plus-minus is considered before two variations are proposed. For the first variation, we present a methodology to calculate an expected goals plus-minus rating. The second variation makes use of in-play probabilities of match outcome to evaluate an expected points plus-minus rating. We use the ratings to examine who are the best players in European football, and demonstrate how the players' ratings evolve over time. Finally, we shed light on the debate regarding which is the strongest league. The model suggests the English Premier League is the strongest, with the German Bundesliga a close runner-up.			arxiv	['Javier López Peña', 'Ian McHale']	142.0

For instance, in sports, agents often choose action sequences with long-term goals in mind, such as achieving a certain strategic position. Conventional policy learning approaches, such as those based on Markov decision processes, generally fail at learning cohesive long-term behavior in such high-dimensional state spaces, and are only effective when myopic modeling lead to the desired behavior. The key difficulty is that conventional approaches are ""shallow"" models that only learn a single state-action policy. We instead propose a hierarchical policy class that automatically reasons about both long-term and short-term goals, which we instantiate as a hierarchical neural network. We showcase our approach in a case study on learning to imitate demonstrated basketball trajectories, and show that it generates significantly more realistic trajectories compared to non-hierarchical baselines as judged by professional sports analysts."			arxiv	['Yisong Yue', 'Patrick Lucey']	143.0

Pudaite	2018-01-13 00:28:22	http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07104v1	I demonstrate that repetition heats players up, while interruption cools players down in NBA free throw shooting. My analysis also suggests that fatigue and stress come into play. If, as seems likely, all four of these effects have comparable impact on field goal shooting, they would justify strategic choices throughout a basketball game that take into account the hot hand. More generally my analysis motivates approaching causal investigation of the variation in the quality of all types of human performance by seeking to operationalize and measure these effects. Viewing the hot hand as a dynamic, causal process motivates an alternative application of the concept of the hot hand: instead of trying to detect which player happens to be hot at the moment, promote that which heats up you and your allies.			arxiv	[]	144.0
403	Multi-resolution Tensor Learning for Large-Scale Spatial Data	Stephan Zheng	2018-02-19 19:54:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06825v2	"High-dimensional tensor models are notoriously computationally expensive to train. We present a meta-learning algorithm, MMT, that can significantly speed up the process for spatial tensor models. MMT leverages the property that spatial data can be viewed at multiple resolutions, which are related by coarsening and finegraining from one resolution to another. Using this property, MMT learns a tensor model by starting from a coarse resolution and iteratively increasing the model complexity. In order to not ""over-train"" on coarse resolution models, we investigate an information-theoretic fine-graining criterion to decide when to transition into higher-resolution models. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence for the advantages of this approach. When applied to two real-world large-scale spatial datasets for basketball player and animal behavior modeling, our approach demonstrate 3 key benefits: 1) it efficiently captures higher-order interactions (i.e., tensor latent factors), 2) it is orders of magnitude faster than fixed resolution learning and scales to very fine-grained spatial resolutions, and 3) it reliably yields accurate and interpretable models."			arxiv	['Rose Yu', 'Yisong Yue']	145.0

In this paper, we propose a novel robust and efficient human activity recognition scheme called ReHAR, which can be used to handle single person activities and group activities prediction. First, we generate an optical flow image for each video frame. Then, both video frames and their corresponding optical flow images are fed into a Single Frame Representation Model to generate representations. Finally, an LSTM is used to pre- dict the final activities based on the generated representations. The whole model is trained end-to-end to allow meaningful representations to be generated for the final activity recognition. We evaluate ReHAR using two well-known datasets: the NCAA Basketball Dataset and the UCFSports Action Dataset. The experimental results show that the pro- posed ReHAR achieves a higher activity recognition accuracy with an order of magnitude shorter computation time compared to the state-of-the-art methods.			arxiv	['Mooi Choo Chuah']	146.0
405	Generative Modeling of Multimodal Multi-Human Behavior	Boris Ivanovic	2018-03-06 04:49:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02015v2	This work presents a methodology for modeling and predicting human behavior in settings with N humans interacting in highly multimodal scenarios (i.e. where there are many possible highly-distinct futures). A motivating example includes robots interacting with humans in crowded environments, such as self-driving cars operating alongside human-driven vehicles or human-robot collaborative bin packing in a warehouse. Our approach to model human behavior in such uncertain environments is to model humans in the scene as nodes in a graphical model, with edges encoding relationships between them. For each human, we learn a multimodal probability distribution over future actions from a dataset of multi-human interactions. Learning such distributions is made possible by recent advances in the theory of conditional variational autoencoders and deep learning approximations of probabilistic graphical models. Specifically, we learn action distributions conditioned on interaction history, neighboring human behavior, and candidate future agent behavior in order to take into account response dynamics. We demonstrate the performance of such a modeling approach in modeling basketball player trajectories, a highly multimodal, multi-human scenario which serves as a proxy for many robotic applications.			arxiv	['Edward Schmerling', 'Karen Leung', 'Marco Pavone']	147.0

It would be even more challenging when rewards are sparse and delayed over long trajectories. In this paper, we study hierarchical deep MARL in cooperative multiagent problems with sparse and delayed reward. With temporal abstraction, we decompose the problem into a hierarchy of different time scales and investigate how agents can learn high-level coordination based on the independent skills learned at the low level. Three hierarchical deep MARL architectures are proposed to learn hierarchical policies under different MARL paradigms. Besides, we propose a new experience replay mechanism to alleviate the issue of the sparse transitions at the high level of abstraction and the non-stationarity of multiagent learning. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in two domains with extremely sparse feedback: (1) a variety of Multiagent Trash Collection tasks, and (2) a challenging online mobile game, i.e., Fever Basketball Defense.			arxiv	['Jianye Hao', 'Tangjie Lv', 'Yingfeng Chen', 'Zongzhang Zhang', 'Hangtian Jia', 'Chunxu Ren', 'Yan Zheng', 'Zhaopeng Meng', 'Changjie Fan', 'Li Wang']	148.0
407	Augmenting Adjusted Plus-Minus in Soccer with FIFA Ratings	Francesca Matano	2018-10-18 13:14:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08032v1	In basketball and hockey, state-of-the-art player value statistics are often variants of Adjusted Plus-Minus (APM). But APM hasn't had the same impact in soccer, since soccer games are low scoring with a low number of substitutions. In soccer, perhaps the most comprehensive player value statistics come from video games, and in particular FIFA. FIFA ratings combine the subjective evaluations of over 9000 scouts, coaches, and season-ticket holders into ratings for over 18,000 players. This paper combines FIFA ratings and APM into a single metric, which we call Augmented APM. The key idea is recasting APM into a Bayesian framework, and incorporating FIFA ratings into the prior distribution. We show that Augmented APM predicts better than both standard APM and a model using only FIFA ratings. We also show that Augmented APM decorrelates players that are highly collinear.			arxiv	['Lee F.

In these games, PTZ cameras rotate very fast and players cover large image areas. To overcome these challenges, we propose to use a novel camera model for tracking and to use rays as landmarks in mapping. Rays overcome the missing depth in pure-rotation cameras. We also develop an online pan-tilt forest for mapping and introduce moving objects (players) detection to mitigate negative impacts from foreground objects. We test our method on both synthetic and real datasets. The experimental results show the superior performance of our method over previous methods for online PTZ camera pose estimation.			arxiv	['Jianhui Chen', 'James J. Little']	150.0

Most common filtering techniques do reduce the irregularities in data; however, they fail to mimic the behavior of a human cameraman. Global filtering methods modeling human camera operators have been successful; however, they are limited to offline settings. In this paper, we propose two online filtering methods called Cinefilters, which produce smooth camera trajectories that are motivated by cinematographic principles. The first filter (CineConvex) uses a sliding window-based convex optimization formulation, and the second (CineCNN) is a CNN based encoder-decoder model. We evaluate the proposed filters in two different settings, namely a basketball dataset and a stage performance dataset. Our models outperform previous methods and baselines on both quantitative and qualitative metrics. The CineConvex and CineCNN filters operate at about 250fps and 1000fps, respectively, with a minor latency (half a second), making them apt for a variety of real-time applications.			arxiv	['K L Bhanu Moorthy', 'Syed Ashar Javed', 'Nikita Shravan', 'Vineet Gandhi', 'Anoop Namboodiri']	151.0

The concept and implementation originated within the Learning branch of the Intelligent Wearable Robotics Project (also known as the Third Arm project) at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab-Toyota Center (SAIL-TC). The Third Arm Project focuses on the development and conceptualization of a robotic arm that can aid users in a whole array of situations: i.e. carrying a cup of coffee, holding a flashlight. Servant uses a K-Means fit-and-predict architecture to classify environmental scenes, such as that of a coffee shop or a basketball gym, using visual and auditory cues. Following such classification, Servant can recommend contextual actions based on prior training.			arxiv	['J. Kenneth Salisbury']	152.0

Accuracy, efficiency, and low memory consumption are desirable for real-time tasks such as intelligent broadcasting and automatic event classification. In this paper, we present a cascaded convolutional neural network (CNN) that satisfies all three of these requirements. Our method first trains a binary (player/non-player) classification network from labeled image patches. Then, our method efficiently applies the network to a whole image in testing. We conducted experiments on basketball and soccer games. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can accurately detect players under challenging conditions such as varying illumination, highly dynamic camera movements and motion blur. Comparing with conventional CNNs, our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on both games with 1000x fewer parameters (i.e., it is light}.			arxiv	['Jianhui Chen', 'James J.

As we are in a discrete setting, the event we analyse here is '' invisible '' to the tools of Brownian motion theory. It is interesting that the key tool for analysing directed lattice paths, which is the kernel method, is not directly applicable here. Therefore, we introduce a variant of this kernel method to get the trivariate generating function (length, final altitude, local time): this leads to an expression involving symmetric and algebraic functions. We apply this analysis to different types of constrained lattice paths (meanders , excursions, bridges,. . .). Then, we illustrate this approach on 'basketball walks ' which are walks defined by the jumps --2, --1, 0, +1, +2. We use singularity analysis to prove that the limit laws for the local time are (depending on the drift and the type of walk) the geometric distribution, the negative binomial distribution, the Rayleigh distribution, or the half-normal distribution (a universal distribution up to now rarely encountered in analytic combinatorics).			arxiv	['Michael Wallner']	155.0

This is because (1) the table consists of multiple rows and columns, which means that encoding a table should not depend only on one dimensional sequence or set of records and (2) most of the tables are time series data (e.g. NBA game data, stock market data), which means that the description of the current table may be affected by its historical data. To address aforementioned problems, not only do we model each table cell considering other records in the same row, we also enrich table's representation by modeling each table cell in context of other cells in the same column or with historical (time dimension) data respectively. In addition, we develop a table cell fusion gate to combine representations from row, column and time dimension into one dense vector according to the saliency of each dimension's representation. We evaluated our methods on ROTOWIRE, a benchmark dataset of NBA basketball games. Both automatic and human evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with improvement of 2.66 in BLEU over the strong baseline and outperformance of state-of-the-art model.			arxiv	['Xiaocheng Feng', 'Bing Qin', 'Ting Liu']	156.0

In this contribution, we investigate the potential occurrence of a 'hot shoe' effect for the performance of penalty takers in football based on data from the German Bundesliga. For this purpose, we consider hidden Markov models (HMMs) to model the (latent) forms of players. To further account for individual heterogeneity of the penalty taker as well as the opponent's goalkeeper, player-specific abilities are incorporated in the model formulation together with a LASSO penalty. Our results suggest states which can be tied to different forms of players, thus providing evidence for the hot shoe effect, and shed some light on exceptionally well-performing goalkeepers, which are of potential interest to managers and sports fans.			arxiv	['Andreas Groll']	157.0

Although not as popular as football or basketball, volleyball is a team sport with both national and international level competitions in almost every country. However, there is almost no study investigating the prediction of volleyball game outcomes and team rankings in national leagues. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for the prediction of the rankings of volleyball national teams, which also allows to estimate the results of each match in the league. We consider two alternative model specifications of different complexity which are validated using data from the women's volleyball Italian Serie A1 2017-2018 season.			arxiv	[]	158.0

Whereas the availability of play-by-play or player tracking data in sports such as basketball and baseball has led to an increase of sports analytics studies, equivalent datasets for the National Football League (NFL) were not freely available for a long time. In this contribution, we consider a comprehensive play-by-play NFL dataset provided by www.kaggle.com, comprising 289,191 observations in total, to predict play calls in the NFL using hidden Markov models. The resulting out-of-sample prediction accuracy for the 2018 NFL season is 71.5%, which is substantially higher compared to similar studies on play call predictions in the NFL.			arxiv	[]	159.0

While sports have provided an appropriate platform for studying this phenomenon, the majority of existing literature examines scenarios in a vacuum with results that might or might not be applicable in the wild. In this report, we build on the existing literature and develop an appropriate framework to quantify the extend to which success can come in streaks -- beyond the stroke of chance -- in a natural environment. Considering actual basketball game situations, our results provide strong statistical evidence that the hot hand exists in this setting. Even though our results are based on a sports setting, we believe that our study provides a path towards thinking of the hot hand outside of laboratory-like, controlled environment. This is crucial if we want to use similar results to enhance our decision making and better understand short and long term outcomes of repeated decisions."			arxiv	['Wayne Winston']	161.0

We find that incorporating social data into various machine learning algorithms substantially improves the algorithms' ability to correctly determine these transitions. In particular, we measure how player performance, team fitness, and social data individually and collectively contribute to predicting these transitions. Incorporating individual performance and team fitness both improve the predictive accuracy of our algorithms. However, this improvement is dwarfed by the improvement seen when we include social data suggesting that social relationships have a comparatively large effect on player transitions in both MLB and in the NBA.			arxiv	['Rebecca Jones', 'Joseph Leung', 'Benjamin Z.

Recent work has proposed that this is due to chance and attempts have been made to simulate the distribution of win percentages to identify the most likely proportion of matches decided by chance. We argue that the approach that has been chosen so far makes some simplifying assumptions that cause its result to be of limited practical value. Instead, we propose to use clustering of statistical team profiles and observed scheduling information to derive limits on the predictive accuracy for particular seasons, which can be used to assess the performance of predictive models on those seasons. We show that the resulting simulated distributions are much closer to the observed distributions and give higher assessments of chance and tighter limits on predictive accuracy.			arxiv	[]	163.0

423	Learning Calibratable Policies using Programmatic Style-Consistency	Eric Zhan	2019-10-02 19:34:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01179v3	We study the problem of controllable generation of long-term sequential behaviors, where the goal is to calibrate to multiple behavior styles simultaneously. In contrast to the well-studied areas of controllable generation of images, text, and speech, there are two questions that pose significant challenges when generating long-term behaviors: how should we specify the factors of variation to control, and how can we ensure that the generated behavior faithfully demonstrates combinatorially many styles? We leverage programmatic labeling functions to specify controllable styles, and derive a formal notion of style-consistency as a learning objective, which can then be solved using conventional policy learning approaches. We evaluate our framework using demonstrations from professional basketball players and agents in the MuJoCo physics environment, and show that existing approaches that do not explicitly enforce style-consistency fail to generate diverse behaviors whereas our learned policies can be calibrated for up to 1024 distinct style combinations.			arxiv	['Albert Tseng', 'Yisong Yue', 'Adith Swaminathan', 'Matthew Hausknecht']	165.0

Biological agents independently have limited observation and mechanical constraints; however, most of the conventional data-driven models ignore such assumptions, resulting in lack of biological plausibility and model interpretability for behavioral analyses. Here we propose sequential generative models with partial observation and mechanical constraints in a decentralized manner, which can model agents' cognition and body dynamics, and predict biologically plausible behaviors. We formulate this as a decentralized multi-agent imitation-learning problem, leveraging binary partial observation and decentralized policy models based on hierarchical variational recurrent neural networks with physical and biomechanical penalties. Using real-world basketball and soccer datasets, we show the effectiveness of our method in terms of the constraint violations, long-term trajectory prediction, and partial observation. Our approach can be used as a multi-agent simulator to generate realistic trajectories using real-world data.			arxiv	['Naoya Takeishi', 'Yoshinobu Kawahara', 'Kazuya Takeda']	166.0
425	Dynamic Relational Inference in Multi-Agent Trajectories	Ruichao Xiao	2020-07-16 19:15:16	http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13524v2	Inferring interactions from multi-agent trajectories has broad applications in physics, vision and robotics. Neural relational inference (NRI) is a deep generative model that can reason about relations in complex dynamics without supervision. In this paper, we take a careful look at this approach for relational inference in multi-agent trajectories. First, we discover that NRI can be fundamentally limited without sufficient long-term observations. Its ability to accurately infer interactions degrades drastically for short output sequences. Next, we consider a more general setting of relational inference when interactions are changing overtime. We propose an extension ofNRI, which we call the DYnamic multi-AgentRelational Inference (DYARI) model that can reason about dynamic relations. We conduct exhaustive experiments to study the effect of model architecture, under-lying dynamics and training scheme on the performance of dynamic relational inference using a simulated physics system. We also showcase the usage of our model on real-world multi-agent basketball trajectories.			arxiv	['Manish Kumar Singh', 'Rose Yu']	167.0
426	Using Experts' Opinions in Machine Learning Tasks	Jafar Habibi	2020-08-10 15:48:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04216v3	In machine learning tasks, especially in the tasks of prediction, scientists tend to rely solely on available historical data and disregard unproven insights, such as experts' opinions, polls, and betting odds. In this paper, we propose a general three-step framework for utilizing experts' insights in machine learning tasks and build four concrete models for a sports game prediction case study. For the case study, we have chosen the task of predicting NCAA Men's Basketball games, which has been the focus of a group of Kaggle competitions in recent years. Results highly suggest that the good performance and high scores of the past models are a result of chance, and not because of a good-performing and stable model. Furthermore, our proposed models can achieve more steady results with lower log loss average (best at 0.489) compared to the top solutions of the 2019 competition (>0.503), and reach the top 1%, 10% and 1% in the 2017, 2018 and 2019 leaderboards, respectively.			arxiv	['Amir Fazelinia', 'Issa Annamoradnejad']	168.0
427	Dodge and survive: modeling the predatory nature of dodgeball	Perrin E. Ruth	2020-07-22 00:30:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05891v2	The analysis of games and sports as complex systems can give insights into the dynamics of human competition, and has been proven useful in soccer, basketball, and other professional sports. In this paper we present a model for dodgeball, a popular sport in US schools, and analyze it using an ordinary differential equation (ODE) compartmental model and stochastic agent-based game simulations. The ODE model reveals a rich landscape with different game dynamics occurring depending on the strategies used by the teams, which can in some cases be mapped to scenarios in competitive species models. Stochastic agent-based game simulations confirm and complement the predictions of the deterministic ODE models. In some scenarios, game victory can be interpreted as a noise-driven escape from the basin of attraction of a stable fixed point, resulting in extremely long games when the number of players is large. Using the ODE and agent-based models, we construct a strategy to increase the probability of winning.			arxiv	['Juan G. Restrepo']	169.0
428	Multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction of NBA Players	Sandro Hauri	2020-08-18 11:35:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07870v1	National Basketball Association (NBA) players are highly motivated and skilled experts that solve complex decision making problems at every time point during a game. As a step towards understanding how players make their decisions, we focus on their movement trajectories during games. We propose a method that captures the multi-modal behavior of players, where they might consider multiple trajectories and select the most advantageous one. The method is built on an LSTM-based architecture predicting multiple trajectories and their probabilities, trained by a multi-modal loss function that updates the best trajectories. Experiments on large, fine-grained NBA tracking data show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art. In addition, the results indicate that the approach generates more realistic trajectories and that it can learn individual playing styles of specific players.			arxiv	['Nemanja Djuric', 'Vladan Radosavljevic', 'Slobodan Vucetic']	170.0
429	Bayesian Nonparametric Estimation for Point Processes with Spatial Homogeneity: A Spatial Analysis of NBA Shot Locations	Fan Yin	2020-11-23 02:32:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11178v1	Basketball shot location data provide valuable summary information regarding players to coaches, sports analysts, fans, statisticians, as well as players themselves. Represented by spatial points, such data are naturally analyzed with spatial point process models. We present a novel nonparametric Bayesian method for learning the underlying intensity surface built upon a combination of Dirichlet process and Markov random field. Our method has the advantage of effectively encouraging local spatial homogeneity when estimating a globally heterogeneous intensity surface. Posterior inferences are performed with an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Simulation studies show that the inferences are accurate and that the method is superior compared to the competing methods. Application to the shot location data of $20$ representative NBA players in the 2017-2018 regular season offers interesting insights about the shooting patterns of these players. A comparison against the competing method shows that the proposed method can effectively incorporate spatial contiguity into the estimation of intensity surfaces.			arxiv	['Jieying Jiao', 'Guanyu Hu', 'Jun Yan']	171.0
430	A Graph Attention Based Approach for Trajectory Prediction in Multi-agent Sports Games	Ding Ding	2020-12-18 21:51:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10531v1	This work investigates the problem of multi-agents trajectory prediction. Prior approaches lack of capability of capturing fine-grained dependencies among coordinated agents. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal trajectory prediction approach that is able to learn the strategy of a team with multiple coordinated agents. In particular, we use graph-based attention model to learn the dependency of the agents. In addition, instead of utilizing the recurrent networks (e.g., VRNN, LSTM), our method uses a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) as the sequential model to support long effective history and provide important features such as parallelism and stable gradients. We demonstrate the validation and effectiveness of our approach on two different sports game datasets: basketball and soccer datasets. The result shows that compared to related approaches, our model that infers the dependency of players yields substantially improved performance.

431	Having a Ball: evaluating scoring streaks and game excitement using in-match trend estimation	Claus Thorn Ekstrøm	2020-12-22 10:30:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11915v1	Many popular sports involve matches between two teams or players where each team have the possibility of scoring points throughout the match. While the overall match winner and result is interesting, it conveys little information about the underlying scoring trends throughout the match. Modeling approaches that accommodate a finer granularity of the score difference throughout the match is needed to evaluate in-game strategies, discuss scoring streaks, teams strengths, and other aspects of the game. We propose a latent Gaussian process to model the score difference between two teams and introduce the Trend Direction Index as an easily interpretable probabilistic measure of the current trend in the match as well as a measure of post-game trend evaluation. In addition we propose the Excitement Trend Index - the expected number of monotonicity changes in the running score difference - as a measure of overall game excitement. Our proposed methodology is applied to all 1143 matches from the 2019-2020 National Basketball Association (NBA) season. We show how the trends can be interpreted in individual games and how the excitement score can be used to cluster teams according to how exciting they are to watch.			arxiv	['Andreas Kryger Jensen']	173.0
432	Threshold Martingales and the Evolution of Forecasts	Dean P. Foster	2021-05-14 13:49:55	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06834v1	This paper introduces a martingale that characterizes two properties of evolving forecast distributions. Ideal forecasts of a future event behave as martingales, sequen- tially updating the forecast to leverage the available information as the future event approaches. The threshold martingale introduced here measures the proportion of the forecast distribution lying below a threshold. In addition to being calibrated, a threshold martingale has quadratic variation that accumulates to a total determined by a quantile of the initial forecast distribution. Deviations from calibration or to- tal volatility signal problems in the underlying model. Calibration adjustments are well-known, and we augment these by introducing a martingale filter that improves volatility while guaranteeing smaller mean squared error. Thus, post-processing can rectify problems with calibration and volatility without revisiting the original forecast- ing model. We apply threshold martingales first to forecasts from simulated models and then to models that predict the winner in professional basketball games.			arxiv	['Robert A. Stine']	174.0

We define the problem setting, the formal investment strategies, and review their common modifications used in practice. The underlying purpose of the reviewed modifications is to mitigate the additional risk stemming from the unrealistic mathematical assumptions of the formal strategies. We test the resulting methods using a unified evaluation protocol for three sports: horse racing, basketball and soccer. The results show the practical necessity of the additional risk-control methods and demonstrate their individual benefits. Particularly, we show that an adaptive variant of the popular ``fractional Kelly'' method is a very suitable choice across a wide range of settings.			arxiv	['Gustav Šourek', 'Ondřej Hubáček', 'Filip Železný']	175.0

We find that during the pandemic, the moneyline betting markets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) became very inefficient. During this period, if one bet uniformly on underdog teams in the NBA, one could achieve a 16.7% profit margin. It is hypothesized that this inefficiency is due to the absence of live audiences during the NBA games. Such inefficiencies are not seen for any other sport. Much of the inefficiency comes from a small fraction of games with moneyline odds in the 233 to 400 range. We find that with clever strategies, one is able to achieve a 26-fold gain on an initial investment by betting on NBA underdogs during this time period.			arxiv	['Tauhid Zaman']	176.0

However, existing approaches either assume that team formation is consistent throughout a match or assign formations frame-by-frame, which disagree with real situations. To tackle this issue, we propose a change-point detection framework named SoccerCPD that distinguishes tactically intended formation and role changes from temporary changes in soccer matches. We first assign roles to players frame-by-frame and perform two-step change-point detections: (1) formation change-point detection based on the sequence of role-adjacency matrices and (2) role change-point detection based on the sequence of role permutations. The evaluation of SoccerCPD using the ground truth annotated by domain experts shows that our method accurately detects the points of tactical changes and estimates the formation and role assignment per segment. Lastly, we introduce practical use-cases that domain participants can easily interpret and utilize.			arxiv	['Bit Kim', 'Dongwook Chung', 'Jinsung Yoon', 'Sang-Ki Ko']	177.0

And the main characteristics of this challenge are there is a high level of occlusions between players and the amount of data is quite limited. In order to address these problems, we designed a strong instance segmentation pipeline. Firstly, we employed a proper data augmentation strategy for this task mainly including photometric distortion transform and copy-paste strategy, which can generate more image instances with a wider distribution. Secondly, we employed a strong segmentation model, Hybrid Task Cascade based detector on the Swin-Base based CBNetV2 backbone, and we add MaskIoU head to HTCMaskHead that can simply and effectively improve the performance of instance segmentation. Finally, the SWA training strategy was applied to improve the performance further. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed pipeline can achieve a competitive result on the DeepSportRadar challenge, with 0.768AP@0.50:0.95 on the challenge set.

Contrary to other studies, which focus primarily on season games, this study investigates playoff games. MambaNet is a hybrid neural network architecture that processes a time series of teams' and players' game statistics and generates the probability of a team winning or losing an NBA playoff match.

Three experiments using six different datasets are conducted to evaluate the performance and generalizability of our architecture against a wide range of previous studies. Our final method successfully predicted the AUC from 0.72 to 0.82, beating the best-performing baseline models by a considerable margin.			arxiv	['Sari Saba-Sadiya', 'Sina Esfandiarpour', 'Tuka Alhanai', 'Mohammad M.

The dataset is challenging because of the unstable camera view, athletes' complex trajectory, and complicated background. Previous MOT methods can not match enough high-quality tracks of athletes. To pursue higher performance of MOT in sports scenes, we introduce an innovative tracker named SportsTrack, we utilize tracking by detection as our detection paradigm. Then we will introduce a three-stage matching process to solve the motion blur and body overlapping in sports scenes. Meanwhile, we present another innovation point: one-to-many correspondence between detection bboxes and crowded tracks to handle the overlap of athletes' bodies during sports competitions. Compared to other trackers such as BOT-SORT and ByteTrack, We carefully restored edge-lost tracks that were ignored by other trackers.

Here, we present NBA2Vec, a neural network model based on Word2Vec which extracts dense feature representations of each player by predicting play outcomes without the use of hand-crafted heuristics or aggregate statistical measures. Specifically, our model aimed to predict the outcome of a possession given both the offensive and defensive players on the court. By training on over 3.5 million plays involving 1551 distinct players, our model was able to achieve a 0.3 K-L divergence with respect to the empirical play-by-play distribution. The resulting embedding space is consistent with general classifications of player position and style, and the embedding dimensions correlated at a significant level with traditional box score metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that NBA2Vec accurately predicts the outcomes to various 2017 NBA Playoffs series, and shows potential in determining optimal lineup match-ups. Future applications of NBA2Vec embeddings to characterize players' style may revolutionize predictive models for player acquisition and coaching decisions that maximize team success.			arxiv	['Nauman Javed', 'Peter Lu']	181.0

Such data consist of interactions among players of competing teams indexed by space and time. High-resolution tracking data on interactions among players are vital to understanding and predicting the performance of teams, because the performance of a team is more than the sum of the strengths of its individual players. We introduce a continuous-time stochastic process as a model of interactions among players of competing teams indexed by space and time, discuss properties of the continuous-time stochastic process, and learn the stochastic process from high-resolution tracking data by pursuing a Bayesian approach. We present an application to Juventus Turin, Inter Milan, and other Italian football clubs.			arxiv	['Yong Feng', 'Guanyu Hu', 'Michael Schweinberger']	182.0

The paper introduces an equation showing how a team's four factors in conjunction with its field goal and free throw percentages can be used to calculate its offensive rating. Moreover, the substitution of defensive four factors into the equation allows for the calculation of defensive and net ratings. To incorporate recent trends in the NBA, the paper updates the estimation for the relative frequency of possession-ending free throws which are needed to estimate the number of possessions from box score data. Sensitivity analysis of the offensive rating is performed in order to better understand the relative importance of the four factors. By examining partial derivatives of the offensive rating, the paper quantifies the marginal impact of small changes in the offensive and defensive four factors on offensive, defensive, and net ratings. Most importantly it is observed that the relationship between the four factors and efficiency ratings is non-linear and the individual factors' effect on the ratings depends on the values of the other factors. The paper also includes examples from NBA seasons spanning 1996-97 through 2022-23.			arxiv	['Topi Halme']	183.0
442	Discovering Intrinsic Spatial-Temporal Logic Rules to Explain Human Actions	Chengzhi Cao	2023-06-21 13:04:16	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12244v1	We propose a logic-informed knowledge-driven modeling framework for human movements by analyzing their trajectories. Our approach is inspired by the fact that human actions are usually driven by their intentions or desires, and are influenced by environmental factors such as the spatial relationships with surrounding objects. In this paper, we introduce a set of spatial-temporal logic rules as knowledge to explain human actions. These rules will be automatically discovered from observational data. To learn the model parameters and the rule content, we design an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which treats the rule content as latent variables. The EM algorithm alternates between the E-step and M-step: in the E-step, the posterior distribution over the latent rule content is evaluated; in the M-step, the rule generator and model parameters are jointly optimized by maximizing the current expected log-likelihood. Our model may have a wide range of applications in areas such as sports analytics, robotics, and autonomous cars, where understanding human movements are essential. We demonstrate the model's superior interpretability and prediction performance on pedestrian and NBA basketball player datasets, both achieving promising results.			arxiv	['Chao Yang', 'Shuang Li']	184.0

For example, what would it look like if we placed a basketball into Claude Monet's ``Water Lilies, Evening Effect''? We propose Reference-based Painterly Inpainting, a novel task that crosses the wild reference domain gap and implants novel objects into artworks. Although previous works have examined reference-based inpainting, they are not designed for large domain discrepancies between the target and the reference, such as inpainting an artistic image using a photorealistic reference. This paper proposes a novel diffusion framework, dubbed RefPaint, to ``inpaint more wildly'' by taking such references with large domain gaps. Built with an image-conditioned diffusion model, we introduce a ladder-side branch and a masked fusion mechanism to work with the inpainting mask. By decomposing the CLIP image embeddings at inference time, one can manipulate the strength of semantic and style information with ease. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed RefPaint framework produces significantly better results than existing methods. Our method enables creative painterly image inpainting with reference objects that would otherwise be difficult to achieve.

As such, MAS opens opportunities to exciting and diverse fields of motion previously under-explored as 3D data is scarce and hard to collect. MAS works by simultaneously denoising multiple 2D motion sequences representing different views of the same 3D motion. It ensures consistency across all views at each diffusion step by combining the individual generations into a unified 3D sequence, and projecting it back to the original views. We demonstrate MAS on 2D pose data acquired from videos depicting professional basketball maneuvers, rhythmic gymnastic performances featuring a ball apparatus, and horse races. In each of these domains, 3D motion capture is arduous, and yet, MAS generates diverse and realistic 3D sequences. Unlike the Score Distillation approach, which optimizes each sample by repeatedly applying small fixes, our method uses a sampling process that was constructed for the diffusion framework. As we demonstrate, MAS avoids common issues such as out-of-domain sampling and mode-collapse. https://guytevet.github.io/mas-page/			arxiv	['Guy Tevet', 'Daniel Cohen-Or', 'Amit H. Bermano']	186.0

ACM MMSports 2023 DeepSportRadar has introduced a dataset that focuses on segmenting human subjects within a basketball context and a specialized evaluation metric for occlusion scenarios. Given the modest size of the dataset and the highly deformable nature of the objects to be segmented, this challenge demands the application of robust data augmentation techniques and wisely-chosen deep learning architectures. Our work (ranked 1st in the competition) first proposes a novel data augmentation technique, capable of generating more training samples with wider distribution. Then, we adopt a new architecture - Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC) framework with CBNetV2 as backbone and MaskIoU head to improve segmentation performance. Furthermore, we employ a Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) training strategy to improve the model's generalization. As a result, we achieve a remarkable occlusion score (OM) of 0.533 on the challenge dataset, securing the top-1 position on the leaderboard.

However, there are limited approaches for extracting 3D human skeletons from multimodal inputs (e.g., RGB and pointcloud) that can enhance the accuracy of predicting 3D poses in challenging situations. We fill this gap by introducing a pipeline called PointVoxel that fuses multi-view RGB and pointcloud inputs to obtain 3D human poses. We demonstrate that volumetric representation is an effective architecture for integrating these different modalities. Moreover, in order to overcome the challenges of annotating 3D human pose labels in difficult scenarios, we develop a synthetic dataset generator for pretraining and design an unsupervised domain adaptation strategy so that we can obtain a well-trained 3D human pose estimator without using any manual annotations. We evaluate our approach on four datasets (two public datasets, one synthetic dataset, and one challenging dataset named BasketBall collected by ourselves), showing promising results. The code and dataset will be released soon.			arxiv	['Zhicheng Zhong', 'Wenxuan Guo', 'Yifan Chen', 'Jianjiang Feng', 'Jie Zhou']	188.0

Redner	2004-02-10 17:22:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0402048v5	A simple relation is developed between elastic collisions of freely-moving point particles in one dimension and a corresponding billiard system. For two particles with masses m_1 and m_2 on the half-line x>0 that approach an elastic barrier at x=0, the corresponding billiard system is an infinite wedge. The collision history of the two particles can be easily inferred from the corresponding billiard trajectory. This connection nicely explains the classic demonstrations of the ``dime on the superball'' and the ``baseball on the basketball'' that are a staple in elementary physics courses. It is also shown that three elastic particles on an infinite line and three particles on a finite ring correspond, respectively, to the motion of a billiard ball in an infinite wedge and on on a triangular billiard table. It is shown how to determine the angles of these two sets in terms of the particle masses.			arxiv	[]	189.0

Thomas	2012-08-03 17:19:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0799v2	"Evaluating the overall ability of players in the National Hockey League (NHL) is a difficult task. Existing methods such as the famous ""plus/minus"" statistic have many shortcomings. Standard linear regression methods work well when player substitutions are relatively uncommon and scoring events are relatively common, such as in basketball, but as neither of these conditions exists for hockey, we use an approach that embraces the unique characteristics of the sport. We model the scoring rate for each team as its own semi-Markov process, with hazard functions for each process that depend on the players on the ice. This method yields offensive and defensive player ability ratings which take into account quality of teammates and opponents, the game situation, and other desired factors, that themselves have a meaningful interpretation in terms of game outcomes. Additionally, since the number of parameters in this model can be quite large, we make use of two different shrinkage methods depending on the question of interest: full Bayesian hierarchical models that partially pool parameters according to player position, and penalized maximum likelihood estimation to select a smaller number of parameters that stand out as being substantially different from average. We apply the model to all five-on-five (full-strength) situations for games in five NHL seasons."			arxiv	['Samuel L. Ventura', 'Shane Jensen', 'Stephen Ma']	190.0
449	Scheduling Bipartite Tournaments to Minimize Total Travel Distance	Richard Hoshino	2014-01-16 05:24:01	http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3909v1	In many professional sports leagues, teams from opposing leagues/conferences compete against one another, playing inter-league games. This is an example of a bipartite tournament. In this paper, we consider the problem of reducing the total travel distance of bipartite tournaments, by analyzing inter-league scheduling from the perspective of discrete optimization. This research has natural applications to sports scheduling, especially for leagues such as the National Basketball Association (NBA) where teams must travel long distances across North America to play all their games, thus consuming much time, money, and greenhouse gas emissions. We introduce the Bipartite Traveling Tournament Problem (BTTP), the inter-league variant of the well-studied Traveling Tournament Problem. We prove that the 2n-team BTTP is NP-complete, but for small values of n, a distance-optimal inter-league schedule can be generated from an algorithm based on minimum-weight 4-cycle-covers. We apply our theoretical results to the 12-team Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) league in Japan, producing a provably-optimal schedule requiring 42950 kilometres of total team travel, a 16% reduction compared to the actual distance traveled by these teams during the 2010 NPB season. We also develop a nearly-optimal inter-league tournament for the 30-team NBA league, just 3.8% higher than the trivial theoretical lower bound.			arxiv	['Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi']	191.0
450	Iterative hypothesis testing for multi-object tracking in presence of features with variable reliability	Amit Kumar K. C.	2015-09-01 14:27:50	http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00313v1	This paper assumes prior detections of multiple targets at each time instant, and uses a graph-based approach to connect those detections across time, based on their position and appearance estimates. In contrast to most earlier works in the field, our framework has been designed to exploit the appearance features, even when they are only sporadically available, or affected by a non-stationary noise, along the sequence of detections. This is done by implementing an iterative hypothesis testing strategy to progressively aggregate the detections into short trajectories, named tracklets. Specifically, each iteration considers a node, named key-node, and investigates how to link this key-node with other nodes in its neighborhood, under the assumption that the target appearance is defined by the key-node appearance estimate. This is done through shortest path computation in a temporal neighborhood of the key-node. The approach is conservative in that it only aggregates the shortest paths that are sufficiently better compared to alternative paths. It is also multi-scale in that the size of the investigated neighborhood is increased proportionally to the number of detections already aggregated into the key-node. The multi-scale nature of the process and the progressive relaxation of its conservativeness makes it both computationally efficient and effective. Experimental validations are performed extensively on a toy example, a 15 minutes long multi-view basketball dataset, and other monocular pedestrian datasets.			arxiv	['Damien Delannay', 'Christophe De Vleeschouwer']	192.0
451	A Scalable Framework for NBA Player and Team Comparisons Using Player Tracking Data	Scott Bruce	2015-11-13 16:40:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04351v2	The release of NBA player tracking data greatly enhances the granularity and dimensionality of basketball statistics used to evaluate and compare player performance. However, the high dimensionality of this new data source can be troublesome as it demands more computational resources and reduces the ability to easily interpret findings. Therefore, we must find a way to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining the ability to differentiate and compare player performance. In this paper, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to identify four principal components that account for 68% of the variation in player tracking data from the 2013-2014 regular season and intuitive interpretations of these new dimensions are developed by examining the statistics that influence them the most. In this new high variance, low dimensional space, you can easily compare statistical profiles across any or all of the principal component dimensions to evaluate characteristics that make certain players and teams similar or unique. A simple measure of similarity between two player or team statistical profiles based on the four principal component scores is also constructed. The Statistical Diversity Index (SDI) allows for quick and intuitive comparisons using the entirety of the player tracking data. As new statistics emerge, this framework is scalable as it can incorporate existing and new data sources by reconstructing the principal component dimensions and SDI for improved comparisons. Using principal component scores and SDI, several use cases are presented for improved personnel management.			arxiv	[]	193.0
452	Variational Inference via $χ$-Upper Bound Minimization	Adji B. Dieng	2016-11-01 18:40:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00328v4	Variational inference (VI) is widely used as an efficient alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo. It posits a family of approximating distributions $q$ and finds the closest member to the exact posterior $p$. Closeness is usually measured via a divergence $D(q || p)$ from $q$ to $p$. While successful, this approach also has problems. Notably, it typically leads to underestimation of the posterior variance. In this paper we propose CHIVI, a black-box variational inference algorithm that minimizes $D_{\chi}(p || q)$, the $\chi$-divergence from $p$ to $q$. CHIVI minimizes an upper bound of the model evidence, which we term the $\chi$ upper bound (CUBO). Minimizing the CUBO leads to improved posterior uncertainty, and it can also be used with the classical VI lower bound (ELBO) to provide a sandwich estimate of the model evidence. We study CHIVI on three models: probit regression, Gaussian process classification, and a Cox process model of basketball plays. When compared to expectation propagation and classical VI, CHIVI produces better error rates and more accurate estimates of posterior variance.			arxiv	['Dustin Tran', 'Rajesh Ranganath', 'John Paisley', 'David M.

453	Luck is Hard to Beat: The Difficulty of Sports Prediction	Raquel YS Aoki	2017-06-08 03:38:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02447v1	Predicting the outcome of sports events is a hard task. We quantify this difficulty with a coefficient that measures the distance between the observed final results of sports leagues and idealized perfectly balanced competitions in terms of skill. This indicates the relative presence of luck and skill. We collected and analyzed all games from 198 sports leagues comprising 1503 seasons from 84 countries of 4 different sports: basketball, soccer, volleyball and handball. We measured the competitiveness by countries and sports. We also identify in each season which teams, if removed from its league, result in a completely random tournament. Surprisingly, not many of them are needed. As another contribution of this paper, we propose a probabilistic graphical model to learn about the teams' skills and to decompose the relative weights of luck and skill in each game. We break down the skill component into factors associated with the teams' characteristics. The model also allows to estimate as 0.36 the probability that an underdog team wins in the NBA league, with a home advantage adding 0.09 to this probability. As shown in the first part of the paper, luck is substantially present even in the most competitive championships, which partially explains why sophisticated and complex feature-based models hardly beat simple models in the task of forecasting sports' outcomes.			arxiv	['Renato M Assuncao', 'Pedro OS Vaz de Melo']	195.0
454	Associative Embedding for Game-Agnostic Team Discrimination	Maxime Istasse	2019-07-01 20:20:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01058v1	Assigning team labels to players in a sport game is not a trivial task when no prior is known about the visual appearance of each team. Our work builds on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn a descriptor, namely a pixel-wise embedding vector, that is similar for pixels depicting players from the same team, and dissimilar when pixels correspond to distinct teams. The advantage of this idea is that no per-game learning is needed, allowing efficient team discrimination as soon as the game starts. In principle, the approach follows the associative embedding framework introduced in arXiv:1611.05424 to differentiate instances of objects. Our work is however different in that it derives the embeddings from a lightweight segmentation network and, more fundamentally, because it considers the assignment of the same embedding to unconnected pixels, as required by pixels of distinct players from the same team. Excellent results, both in terms of team labelling accuracy and generalization to new games/arenas, have been achieved on panoramic views of a large variety of basketball games involving players interactions and occlusions. This makes our method a good candidate to integrate team separation in many CNN-based sport analytics pipelines.			arxiv	['Julien Moreau', 'Christophe De Vleeschouwer']	196.0
455	A Bayesian Approach to In-Game Win Probability in Soccer	Pieter Robberechts	2019-06-12 09:38:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05029v2	In-game win probability models, which provide a sports team's likelihood of winning at each point in a game based on historical observations, are becoming increasingly popular. In baseball, basketball and American football, they have become important tools to enhance fan experience, to evaluate in-game decision-making, and to inform coaching decisions. While equally relevant in soccer, the adoption of these models is held back by technical challenges arising from the low-scoring nature of the sport. In this paper, we introduce an in-game win probability model for soccer that addresses the shortcomings of existing models. First, we demonstrate that in-game win probability models for other sports struggle to provide accurate estimates for soccer, especially towards the end of a game. Second, we introduce a novel Bayesian statistical framework that estimates running win, tie and loss probabilities by leveraging a set of contextual game state features. An empirical evaluation on eight seasons of data for the top-five soccer leagues demonstrates that our framework provides well-calibrated probabilities. Furthermore, two use cases show its ability to enhance fan experience and to evaluate performance in crucial game situations.			arxiv	['Jan Van Haaren', 'Jesse Davis']	197.0
456	Learning to Select Bi-Aspect Information for Document-Scale Text Content Manipulation	Xiaocheng Feng	2020-02-24 12:52:10	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10210v1	In this paper, we focus on a new practical task, document-scale text content manipulation, which is the opposite of text style transfer and aims to preserve text styles while altering the content. In detail, the input is a set of structured records and a reference text for describing another recordset. The output is a summary that accurately describes the partial content in the source recordset with the same writing style of the reference. The task is unsupervised due to lack of parallel data, and is challenging to select suitable records and style words from bi-aspect inputs respectively and generate a high-fidelity long document. To tackle those problems, we first build a dataset based on a basketball game report corpus as our testbed, and present an unsupervised neural model with interactive attention mechanism, which is used for learning the semantic relationship between records and reference texts to achieve better content transfer and better style preservation. In addition, we also explore the effectiveness of the back-translation in our task for constructing some pseudo-training pairs. Empirical results show superiority of our approaches over competitive methods, and the models also yield a new state-of-the-art result on a sentence-level dataset.			arxiv	['Yawei Sun', 'Bing Qin', 'Heng Gong', 'Yibo Sun', 'Wei Bi', 'Xiaojiang Liu', 'Ting Liu']	198.0
457	Renormalizing individual performance metrics for cultural heritage management of sports records	Alexander M. Petersen	2020-04-17 19:34:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08428v1	Individual performance metrics are commonly used to compare players from different eras. However, such cross-era comparison is often biased due to significant changes in success factors underlying player achievement rates (e.g. performance enhancing drugs and modern training regimens). Such historical comparison is more than fodder for casual discussion among sports fans, as it is also an issue of critical importance to the multi-billion dollar professional sport industry and the institutions (e.g. Hall of Fame) charged with preserving sports history and the legacy of outstanding players and achievements. To address this cultural heritage management issue, we report an objective statistical method for renormalizing career achievement metrics, one that is particularly tailored for common seasonal performance metrics, which are often aggregated into summary career metrics -- despite the fact that many player careers span different eras. Remarkably, we find that the method applied to comprehensive Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association player data preserves the overall functional form of the distribution of career achievement, both at the season and career level. As such, subsequent re-ranking of the top-50 all-time records in MLB and the NBA using renormalized metrics indicates reordering at the local rank level, as opposed to bulk reordering by era. This local order refinement signals time-independent mechanisms underlying annual and career achievement in professional sports, meaning that appropriately renormalized achievement metrics can be used to compare players from eras with different season lengths, team strategies, rules -- and possibly even different sports.			arxiv	['Orion Penner']	199.0

To minimize ambiguities in action classification, HAA500 consists of highly diversified classes of fine-grained atomic actions, where only consistent actions fall under the same label, e.g., ""Baseball Pitching"" vs ""Free Throw in Basketball"". Thus HAA500 is different from existing atomic action datasets, where coarse-grained atomic actions were labeled with coarse action-verbs such as ""Throw"". HAA500 has been carefully curated to capture the precise movement of human figures with little class-irrelevant motions or spatio-temporal label noises. The advantages of HAA500 are fourfold: 1) human-centric actions with a high average of 69.7% detectable joints for the relevant human poses; 2) high scalability since adding a new class can be done under 20-60 minutes; 3) curated videos capturing essential elements of an atomic action without irrelevant frames; 4) fine-grained atomic action classes. Our extensive experiments including cross-data validation using datasets collected in the wild demonstrate the clear benefits of human-centric and atomic characteristics of HAA500, which enable training even a baseline deep learning model to improve prediction by attending to atomic human poses. We detail the HAA500 dataset statistics and collection methodology and compare quantitatively with existing action recognition datasets."			arxiv	['Cheng-hsin Wuu', 'Hsuan-ru Yang', 'Yu-Wing Tai', 'Chi-Keung Tang']	200.0

Sports are unique in their respective stochastic nature, making analysis, and accurate predictions valuable to those involved in the sport. In response, we focus on Siamese Neural Networks (SNN) in unison with LightGBM and XGBoost models, to predict the importance of matches and to rank teams in Rugby and Basketball. Six models were developed and compared, a LightGBM, a XGBoost, a LightGBM (Contrastive Loss), LightGBM (Triplet Loss), a XGBoost (Contrastive Loss), XGBoost (Triplet Loss). The models that utilise a Triplet loss function perform better than those using Contrastive loss. It is clear LightGBM (Triplet loss) is the most effective model in ranking the NBA, producing a state of the art (SOTA) mAP (0.867) and NDCG (0.98) respectively. The SNN (Triplet loss) most effectively predicted the Super 15 Rugby, yielding the SOTA mAP (0.921), NDCG (0.983), and $r_s$ (0.793). Triplet loss produces the best overall results displaying the value of learning representations/embeddings for prediction and ranking of sports. Overall there is not a single consistent best performing model across the two sports indicating that other Ranking models should be considered in the future.			arxiv	['Jonathan Sandile Sibindi', 'Terence L.

In order to create an effective learning environment that has the potential to address the gender imbalance in computer science, it is essential to better understand gender-specific differences in how children use such programming environments. In this paper, we explore gender differences and similarities in Scratch programs along two dimensions: In order to understand what motivates girls and boys to use Scratch, we apply a topic analysis using unsupervised machine learning for the first time on Scratch programs, using a dataset of 317 programs created by girls and boys in the range of 8-10 years. In order to understand how they program for these topics, we apply automated program analysis on the code implemented in these projects. We find that, in-line with common stereotypes, girls prefer topics that revolve around unicorns, celebrating, dancing and music, while boys tend to prefer gloomy topics with bats and ghouls, or competitive ones such as soccer or basketball. Girls prefer animations and stories, resulting in simpler control structures, while boys create games with more loops and conditional statements, resulting in more complex programs. Considering these differences can help to improve the learning outcomes and the resulting computing-related self-concepts, which are prerequisites for developing a longer-term interest in computer science.			arxiv	['Katharina Geldreich', 'Gordon Fraser']	202.0
461	Interpreting the Tilt-and-Torsion Method to Express Shoulder Joint Kinematics	Félix Chénier	2021-08-24 18:45:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12282v2	Background: Kinematics is studied by practitioners and researchers in different fields of practice. It is therefore critically important to adhere to a taxonomy that explicitly describes positions and movements. However, current representation methods such as cardan and Euler angles fail to report shoulder angles in a way that is easily and correctly interpreted by practitioners, and that is free from numerical instability such as gimbal lock. Methods: In this paper, we comprehensively describe the recent Tilt-and-Torsion method and compare it to the Euler YXY method currently recommended by the International Society of Biomechanics. While using the same three rotations (plane of elevation, elevation, humeral rotation), the Tilt-and-Torsion method reports humeral rotation independently from the plane of elevation. We assess how it can be used to describe shoulder angles (1) in a simulated assessment of humeral rotation with the arm at the side, which constitutes a gimbal lock position, and (2) during an experimental functional task, with 10 wheelchair basketball athletes who sprint in straight line using a sports wheelchair. Findings: In the simulated gimbal lock experiment, the Tilt-and-Torsion method provided both humeral elevation and rotation measurements, contrary to the Euler YXY method. During the wheelchair sprints, humeral rotation ranged from 14{\deg} (externally) to 13{\deg} (internally), which is consistent with typical maximal ranges of humeral rotation, compared to 65{\deg} to 50{\deg} with the Euler YXY method. Interpretation: Based on our results, we recommend that shoulder angles be expressed using Tilt-and-Torsion angles instead of Euler YXY.			arxiv	['Ilona Alberca', 'Arnaud Faupin', 'Dany H Gagnon']	203.0
462	How often does the best team win? A unified approach to understanding randomness in North American sport	Michael J. Lopez	2017-01-21 03:28:57	http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05976v3	Statistical applications in sports have long centered on how to best separate signal (e.g. team talent) from random noise. However, most of this work has concentrated on a single sport, and the development of meaningful cross-sport comparisons has been impeded by the difficulty of translating luck from one sport to another. In this manuscript, we develop Bayesian state-space models using betting market data that can be uniformly applied across sporting organizations to better understand the role of randomness in game outcomes. These models can be used to extract estimates of team strength, the between-season, within-season, and game-to-game variability of team strengths, as well each team's home advantage. We implement our approach across a decade of play in each of the National Football League (NFL), National Hockey League (NHL), National Basketball Association (NBA), and Major League Baseball (MLB), finding that the NBA demonstrates both the largest dispersion in talent and the largest home advantage, while the NHL and MLB stand out for their relative randomness in game outcomes. We conclude by proposing new metrics for judging competitiveness across sports leagues, both within the regular season and using traditional postseason tournament formats. Although we focus on sports, we discuss a number of other situations in which our generalizable models might be usefully applied.			arxiv	['Gregory J. Matthews', 'Benjamin S. Baumer']	204.0

However, a lot of attention has been focused on each coach's individual features. A systematic and quantitative analysis of the whole coach hiring market is lacking. In a coach hiring network, the coaches are actually voting with their feet. It is interesting to analyze what factors are affecting the ""footprint"" left by those head coaches. In this paper, we collect more than 12,000 head coach hiring records in two different popular sports from the NCAA. Using network-based methods, we build the coach hiring network in the NCAA men's basketball and football. We find that: (1).the coach hiring network is of great inequality in coach production with a Gini coefficient close to 0.60. (2).coaches prefer to work within the same geographical region and the same division to their alma maters'. (3).the coach production rankings we calculated using network-based methods are generally correlated to the authoritative rankings, but also show disaccord in specific time period. The results provide us a novel view and better understanding of the coach hiring market in the NCAA and shed new light on the coach hiring system."			arxiv	['Jason', 'Zhang', 'Dongwon Lee']	205.0
464	A Skellam Regression Model for Quantifying Positional Value in Soccer	Konstantinos Pelechrinis	2018-07-19 16:57:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07536v5	Soccer is undeniably the most popular sport world-wide and everyone from general managers and coaching staff to fans and media are interested in evaluating players' performance. Metrics applied successfully in other sports, such as the (adjusted) +/- that allows for division of credit among a basketball team's players, exhibit several challenges when applied to soccer due to severe co-linearities. Recently, a number of player evaluation metrics have been developed utilizing optical tracking data, but they are based on proprietary data. In this work, our objective is to develop an open framework that can estimate the expected contribution of a soccer player to his team's winning chances using publicly available data. In particular, using data from (i) approximately 20,000 games from 11 European leagues over 8 seasons, and, (ii) player ratings from the FIFA video game, we estimate through a Skellam regression model the importance of every line (attackers, midfielders, defenders and goalkeeping) in winning a soccer game. We consequently translate the model to expected league points added above a replacement player (eLPAR). This model can further be used as a guide for allocating a team's salary budget to players based on their expected contributions on the pitch. We showcase similar applications using annual salary data from the English Premier League and identify evidence that in our dataset the market appears to under-value defensive line players relative to goalkeepers.			arxiv	['Wayne Winston']	206.0
465	The causal effect of a timeout at stopping an opposing run in the NBA	Connor Gibbs	2020-11-23 19:42:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11691v3	In the summer of 2017, the National Basketball Association reduced the number of total timeouts, along with other rule changes, to regulate the flow of the game. With these rule changes, it becomes increasingly important for coaches to effectively manage their timeouts. Understanding the utility of a timeout under various game scenarios, e.g., during an opposing team's run, is of the utmost importance. There are two schools of thought when the opposition is on a run: (1) call a timeout and allow your team to rest and regroup, or (2) save a timeout and hope your team can make corrections during play. This paper investigates the credence of these tenets using the Rubin causal model framework to quantify the causal effect of a timeout in the presence of an opposing team's run. Too often overlooked, we carefully consider the stable unit-treatment-value assumption (SUTVA) in this context and use SUTVA to motivate our definition of units. To measure the effect of a timeout, we introduce a novel, interpretable outcome based on the score difference to describe broad changes in the scoring dynamics. This outcome is well-suited for situations where the quantity of interest fluctuates frequently, a commonality in many sports analytics applications. We conclude from our analysis that while comebacks frequently occur after a run, it is slightly disadvantageous to call a timeout during a run by the opposing team and further demonstrate that the magnitude of this effect varies by franchise.			arxiv	['Ryan Elmore', 'Bailey Fosdick']	207.0

The rules regarding the real-world biological multi-agent behaviors such as team sports are often largely unknown due to their inherently higher-order interactions, cognition, and body dynamics. Estimation of the rules from data, i.e., data-driven approaches such as machine learning, provides an effective way for the analysis of such behaviors. Although most data-driven models have non-linear structures and high prediction performances, it is sometimes hard to interpret them. This survey focuses on data-driven analysis for quantitative understanding of invasion team sports behaviors such as basketball and football, and introduces two main approaches for understanding such multi-agent behaviors: (1) extracting easily interpretable features or rules from data and (2) generating and controlling behaviors in visually-understandable ways. The first approach involves the visualization of learned representations and the extraction of mathematical structures behind the behaviors. The second approach can be used to test hypotheses by simulating and controlling future and counterfactual behaviors. Lastly, the potential practical applications of extracted rules, features, and generated behaviors are discussed. These approaches can contribute to a better understanding of multi-agent behaviors in the real world.			arxiv	[]	208.0
467	On the Critical Role of Conventions in Adaptive Human-AI Collaboration	Andy Shih	2021-04-07 02:46:19	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02871v1	Humans can quickly adapt to new partners in collaborative tasks (e.g. playing basketball), because they understand which fundamental skills of the task (e.g. how to dribble, how to shoot) carry over across new partners. Humans can also quickly adapt to similar tasks with the same partners by carrying over conventions that they have developed (e.g. raising hand signals pass the ball), without learning to coordinate from scratch. To collaborate seamlessly with humans, AI agents should adapt quickly to new partners and new tasks as well. However, current approaches have not attempted to distinguish between the complexities intrinsic to a task and the conventions used by a partner, and more generally there has been little focus on leveraging conventions for adapting to new settings. In this work, we propose a learning framework that teases apart rule-dependent representation from convention-dependent representation in a principled way. We show that, under some assumptions, our rule-dependent representation is a sufficient statistic of the distribution over best-response strategies across partners. Using this separation of representations, our agents are able to adapt quickly to new partners, and to coordinate with old partners on new tasks in a zero-shot manner. We experimentally validate our approach on three collaborative tasks varying in complexity: a contextual multi-armed bandit, a block placing task, and the card game Hanabi.			arxiv	['Arjun Sawhney', 'Jovana Kondic', 'Stefano Ermon', 'Dorsa Sadigh']	209.0

This task is challenging since detecting and matching the same 3D keypoint observed from two very different camera views is difficult, making standard structure-from-motion (SfM) pipelines inapplicable. In such circumstances, treating people in the scene as ""keypoints"" and associating them across different camera views can be an alternative method for obtaining correspondences. Based on this intuition, we propose a method that uses ideas from person re-identification (re-ID) for wide-baseline camera calibration. Our method first employs a re-ID method to associate human bounding boxes across cameras, then converts bounding box correspondences to point correspondences, and finally solves for camera pose using multi-view geometry and bundle adjustment. Since our method does not require specialized calibration targets except for visible people, it applies to situations where frequent calibration updates are required. We perform extensive experiments on datasets captured from scenes of different sizes, camera settings (indoor and outdoor), and human activities (walking, playing basketball, construction). Experiment results show that our method achieves similar performance to standard SfM methods relying on manually labeled point correspondences."			arxiv	['Yu-Jhe Li', 'Xinshuo Weng', 'Kris Kitani']	210.0

The purpose of this study is to develop a method for the VA of set data aimed at supporting knowledge discovery and member selection. A typical target application is a visual support system for team analysis and member selection, by which users can analyze past teams and examine candidate lineups for new teams. Because there are several difficulties, such as the combinatorial explosion problem, developing a VA system of set data is challenging. In this study, we first define the requirements that the target system should satisfy and clarify the accompanying challenges. Then we propose a method for the VA of set data, which satisfies the requirements. The key idea is to model the generation process of sets and their outputs using a manifold network model. The proposed method visualizes the relevant factors as a set of topographic maps on which various information is visualized. Furthermore, using the topographic maps as a bidirectional interface, users can indicate their targets of interest in the system on these maps. We demonstrate the proposed method by applying it to basketball teams, and compare with a benchmark system for outcome prediction and lineup reconstruction tasks. Because the method can be adapted to individual application cases by extending the network structure, it can be a general method by which practical systems can be built.			arxiv	['Hideaki Ishibashi', 'Tetsuo Furukawa']	211.0

But language models (LMs) are trained on snapshots of data collected at a specific moment in time, and this can limit their utility, especially in the closed-book setting where the pretraining corpus must contain the facts the model should memorize. We introduce a diagnostic dataset aimed at probing LMs for factual knowledge that changes over time and highlight problems with LMs at either end of the spectrum -- those trained on specific slices of temporal data, as well as those trained on a wide range of temporal data. To mitigate these problems, we propose a simple technique for jointly modeling text with its timestamp. This improves memorization of seen facts from the training time period, as well as calibration on predictions about unseen facts from future time periods. We also show that models trained with temporal context can be efficiently ""refreshed"" as new data arrives, without the need for retraining from scratch."			arxiv	['Jeremy R.

We provide a framework for the useful encoding of short tactics and space occupations in a more extended sequence of movements or tactical plans. We investigate game segments during a match in which the team in possession of the ball regularly attempts to reach a position where they can take a shot at goal for a single game. A carefully designed and efficient kernel is employed using a triangular fuzzy membership function to create multiple time series for players' potential of presence at different court regions. Unsupervised learning is then used for time series using triplet loss and deep neural networks with exponentially dilated causal convolutions for the derived multivariate time series. This works key contribution lies in its approach to model how short scenes contribute to other longer ones and how players occupies and creates new spaces in-game court. We discuss the effectiveness of the proposed approach for prediction and recognition tasks on the professional basketball SportVU dataset for the 2015-16 half-season. The proposed system demonstrates descent functionality even with relatively small data.			arxiv	['Bahman Rohani', 'Amin Nobakhti']	213.0

Silva	2021-10-13 14:25:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08257v1	Given an unlabeled dataset, wherein we have access only to pairwise similarities (or distances), how can we effectively (1) detect outliers, and (2) annotate/tag the outliers by type? Outlier detection has a large literature, yet we find a key gap in the field: to our knowledge, no existing work addresses the outlier annotation problem. Outliers are broadly classified into 3 types, representing distinct patterns that could be valuable to analysts: (a) global outliers are severe yet isolate cases that do not repeat, e.g., a data collection error; (b) local outliers diverge from their peers within a context, e.g., a particularly short basketball player; and (c) collective outliers are isolated micro-clusters that may indicate coalition or repetitions, e.g., frauds that exploit the same loophole. This paper presents C-AllOut: a novel and effective outlier detector that annotates outliers by type. It is parameter-free and scalable, besides working only with pairwise similarities (or distances) when it is needed. We show that C-AllOut achieves on par or significantly better performance than state-of-the-art detectors when spotting outliers regardless of their type. It is also highly effective in annotating outliers of particular types, a task that none of the baselines can perform.			arxiv	['Leman Akoglu', 'Robson L. F. Cordeiro']	214.0
473	DeepSportLab: a Unified Framework for Ball Detection, Player Instance Segmentation and Pose Estimation in Team Sports Scenes	Seyed Abolfazl Ghasemzadeh	2021-12-01 16:30:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00627v1	This paper presents a unified framework to (i) locate the ball, (ii) predict the pose, and (iii) segment the instance mask of players in team sports scenes. Those problems are of high interest in automated sports analytics, production, and broadcast. A common practice is to individually solve each problem by exploiting universal state-of-the-art models, \eg, Panoptic-DeepLab for player segmentation. In addition to the increased complexity resulting from the multiplication of single-task models, the use of the off-the-shelf models also impedes the performance due to the complexity and specificity of the team sports scenes, such as strong occlusion and motion blur. To circumvent those limitations, our paper proposes to train a single model that simultaneously predicts the ball and the player mask and pose by combining the part intensity fields and the spatial embeddings principles. Part intensity fields provide the ball and player location, as well as player joints location. Spatial embeddings are then exploited to associate player instance pixels to their respective player center, but also to group player joints into skeletons. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on the DeepSport basketball dataset, achieving comparable performance to the SoA models addressing each individual task separately.			arxiv	['Gabriel Van Zandycke', 'Maxime Istasse', 'Niels Sayez', 'Amirafshar Moshtaghpour', 'Christophe De Vleeschouwer']	215.0

However, the majority of prior work has been parametric, for example, focusing on exponential families. We develop a fundamentally new and general framework for sequential change detection when the pre- and post-change distributions are nonparametrically specified (and thus composite). Our procedures come with clean, nonasymptotic bounds on the average run length (frequency of false alarms). In certain nonparametric cases (like sub-Gaussian or sub-exponential), we also provide near-optimal bounds on the detection delay following a changepoint. The primary technical tool that we introduce is called an \emph{e-detector}, which is composed of sums of e-processes -- a fundamental generalization of nonnegative supermartingales -- that are started at consecutive times. We first introduce simple Shiryaev-Roberts and CUSUM-style e-detectors, and then show how to design their mixtures in order to achieve both statistical and computational efficiency. Our e-detector framework can be instantiated to recover classical likelihood-based procedures for parametric problems, as well as yielding the first change detection method for many nonparametric problems. As a running example, we tackle the problem of detecting changes in the mean of a bounded random variable without i.i.d. assumptions, with an application to tracking the performance of a basketball team over multiple seasons.			arxiv	['Aaditya Ramdas', 'Alessandro Rinaldo']	217.0

The framework, called GenRL, trains deep policies by introducing an action latent variable such that the feed-forward policy search can be divided into two parts: (i) training a sub-policy that outputs a distribution over the action latent variable given a state of the system, and (ii) unsupervised training of a generative model that outputs a sequence of motor actions conditioned on the latent action variable. GenRL enables safe exploration and alleviates the data-inefficiency problem as it exploits prior knowledge about valid sequences of motor actions. Moreover, we provide a set of measures for evaluation of generative models such that we are able to predict the performance of the RL policy training prior to the actual training on a physical robot. We experimentally determine the characteristics of generative models that have most influence on the performance of the final policy training on two robotics tasks: shooting a hockey puck and throwing a basketball. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that GenRL is the only method which can safely and efficiently solve the robotics tasks compared to two state-of-the-art RL methods.			arxiv	['Petra Poklukar', 'Karol Arndt', 'Chelsea Finn', 'Ville Kyrki', 'Danica Kragic', 'Mårten Björkman']	218.0

Integrating visual analytic methods is consequential in presenting, comparing, and reviewing dynamic graphs. Even though dynamic graph visualization is developed for many years, how to effectively visualize large-scale and time-intensive dynamic graph data with subtle changes is still challenging for researchers. To provide an effective analysis method for this type of dynamic graph data, we propose a snapshot generation algorithm involving Human-In-Loop to help users divide the dynamic graphs into multi-granularity and hierarchical snapshots for further analysis. In addition, we design a visual analysis prototype system (DGSVis) to assist users in accessing the dynamic graph insights effectively. DGSVis integrates a graphical operation interface to help users generate snapshots visually and interactively. It is equipped with the overview and details for visualizing hierarchical snapshots of the dynamic graph data. To illustrate the usability and efficiency of our proposed methods for this type of dynamic graph data, we introduce two case studies based on basketball player networks in a competition. In addition, we conduct an evaluation and receive exciting feedback from experienced visualization experts.			arxiv	['Sujia Zhu', 'Qi Jiang', 'Wang Xia', 'Jingwei Tang', 'Lvhan Pan', 'Ronghua Liang', 'Guodao Sun']	219.0
478	Estimating counterfactual treatment outcomes over time in complex multi-agent scenarios	Keisuke Fujii	2022-06-04 04:04:25	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01900v2	Evaluation of intervention in a multi-agent system, e.g., when humans should intervene in autonomous driving systems and when a player should pass to teammates for a good shot, is challenging in various engineering and scientific fields. Estimating the individual treatment effect (ITE) using counterfactual long-term prediction is practical to evaluate such interventions. However, most of the conventional frameworks did not consider the time-varying complex structure of multi-agent relationships and covariate counterfactual prediction. This may sometimes lead to erroneous assessments of ITE and interpretation problems. Here we propose an interpretable, counterfactual recurrent network in multi-agent systems to estimate the effect of the intervention. Our model leverages graph variational recurrent neural networks and theory-based computation with domain knowledge for the ITE estimation framework based on long-term prediction of multi-agent covariates and outcomes, which can confirm under the circumstances under which the intervention is effective. On simulated models of an automated vehicle and biological agents with time-varying confounders, we show that our methods achieved lower estimation errors in counterfactual covariates and the most effective treatment timing than the baselines. Furthermore, using real basketball data, our methods performed realistic counterfactual predictions and evaluated the counterfactual passes in shot scenarios.			arxiv	['Koh Takeuchi', 'Atsushi Kuribayashi', 'Naoya Takeishi', 'Yoshinobu Kawahara', 'Kazuya Takeda']	220.0

This paper introduces DeepSportradar-v1, a suite of computer vision tasks, datasets and benchmarks for automated sport understanding. The main purpose of this framework is to close the gap between academic research and real world settings. To this end, the datasets provide high-resolution raw images, camera parameters and high quality annotations. DeepSportradar currently supports four challenging tasks related to basketball: ball 3D localization, camera calibration, player instance segmentation and player re-identification. For each of the four tasks, a detailed description of the dataset, objective, performance metrics, and the proposed baseline method are provided. To encourage further research on advanced methods for sport understanding, a competition is organized as part of the MMSports workshop from the ACM Multimedia 2022 conference, where participants have to develop state-of-the-art methods to solve the above tasks. The four datasets, development kits and baselines are publicly available.			arxiv	['Vladimir Somers', 'Maxime Istasse', 'Carlo Del Don', 'Davide Zambrano']	221.0
480	D$^{\bf{3}}$: Duplicate Detection Decontaminator for Multi-Athlete Tracking in Sports Videos	Rui He	2022-09-25 15:46:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12248v1	Tracking multiple athletes in sports videos is a very challenging Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) task, since athletes often have the same appearance and are intimately covered with each other, making a common occlusion problem becomes an abhorrent duplicate detection. In this paper, the duplicate detection is newly and precisely defined as occlusion misreporting on the same athlete by multiple detection boxes in one frame. To address this problem, we meticulously design a novel transformer-based Duplicate Detection Decontaminator (D$^3$) for training, and a specific algorithm Rally-Hungarian (RH) for matching. Once duplicate detection occurs, D$^3$ immediately modifies the procedure by generating enhanced boxes losses. RH, triggered by the team sports substitution rules, is exceedingly suitable for sports videos. Moreover, to complement the tracking dataset that without shot changes, we release a new dataset based on sports video named RallyTrack. Extensive experiments on RallyTrack show that combining D$^3$ and RH can dramatically improve the tracking performance with 9.2 in MOTA and 4.5 in HOTA. Meanwhile, experiments on MOT-series and DanceTrack discover that D$^3$ can accelerate convergence during training, especially save up to 80 percent of the original training time on MOT17. Finally, our model, which is trained only with volleyball videos, can be applied directly to basketball and soccer videos for MAT, which shows priority of our method. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/heruihr/rallytrack.			arxiv	['Zehua Fu', 'Qingjie Liu', 'Yunhong Wang', 'Xunxun Chen']	222.0

However, multi-actor tracking over humans with similar appearance and nonlinear movement can still be very challenging even for the state-of-the-art tracking algorithm. Current motion-based tracking algorithms often use Kalman Filter to predict the motion of an object, however, its linear movement assumption can cause failure in tracking when the target is not moving linearly. And for multi-players tracking over the sports field, because the players in the same team are usually wearing the same color of jersey, making re-identification even harder both in the short term and long term in the tracking process. In this work, we proposed a motionbased tracking algorithm and three post-processing pipelines for three sports including basketball, football, and volleyball, we successfully handle the tracking of the non-linear movement of players on the sports fields. Experiments result on the testing set of ECCV DeeperAction Challenge SportsMOT Dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves a HOTA of 73.968, ranking 3rd place on the 2022 Sportsmot workshop final leaderboard.			arxiv	['Cheng-Yen Yang', 'Jenq-Neng Hwang', 'Pyong-Kun Kim', 'Kwangju Kim', 'Kyoungoh Lee']	223.0

This technology has a very wide application in sports analysis, games, virtual reality, human animation and other fields. The traditional three-dimensional small target detection technology has the disadvantages of high cost, low precision and inconvenience, so it is difficult to apply in practice. With the development of machine learning and deep learning, the technology of computer vision algorithms is becoming more mature. Creating an immersive media experience is considered to be a very important research work in sports. The main work is to explore and solve the problem of football detection under the multiple cameras, aiming at the research and implementation of the live broadcast system of football matches. Using multi cameras detects a target ball and determines its position in three dimension with the occlusion, motion, low illumination of the target object. This paper designed and implemented football detection system under multiple cameras for the detection and capture of targets in real-time matches. The main work mainly consists of three parts, football detector, single camera detection, and multi-cameras detection. The system used bundle adjustment to obtain the three-dimensional position of the target, and the GPU to accelerates data pre-processing and achieve accurate real-time capture of the target. By testing the system, it shows that the system can accurately detect and capture the moving targets in 3D. In addition, the solution in this paper is reusable for large-scale competitions, like basketball and soccer. The system framework can be well transplanted into other similar engineering project systems. It has been put into the market.			arxiv	['Tianfang Zhang', 'Zhongfeng Kang', 'Wenhan Zhang']	224.0

One important task in this context is the performance measurement of individual players to provide reports and log files for subsequent analysis. During sport events like basketball, this involves the re-identification of players during a match either from multiple camera viewpoints or from a single camera viewpoint at different times. In this work, we investigate whether it is possible to transfer the out-standing zero-shot performance of pre-trained CLIP models to the domain of player re-identification. For this purpose we reformulate the contrastive language-to-image pre-training approach from CLIP to a contrastive image-to-image training approach using the InfoNCE loss as training objective. Unlike previous work, our approach is entirely class-agnostic and benefits from large-scale pre-training. With a fine-tuned CLIP ViT-L/14 model we achieve 98.44 % mAP on the MMSports 2022 Player Re-Identification challenge. Furthermore we show that the CLIP Vision Transformers have already strong OCR capabilities to identify useful player features like shirt numbers in a zero-shot manner without any fine-tuning on the dataset. By applying the Score-CAM algorithm we visualise the most important image regions that our fine-tuned model identifies when calculating the similarity score between two images of a player.			arxiv	['Fabian Deuser', 'Norbert Oswald']	225.0
484	SportsMOT: A Large Multi-Object Tracking Dataset in Multiple Sports Scenes	Yutao Cui	2023-04-11 12:07:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05170v2	Multi-object tracking in sports scenes plays a critical role in gathering players statistics, supporting further analysis, such as automatic tactical analysis. Yet existing MOT benchmarks cast little attention on the domain, limiting its development. In this work, we present a new large-scale multi-object tracking dataset in diverse sports scenes, coined as \emph{SportsMOT}, where all players on the court are supposed to be tracked. It consists of 240 video sequences, over 150K frames (almost 15\times MOT17) and over 1.6M bounding boxes (3\times MOT17) collected from 3 sports categories, including basketball, volleyball and football. Our dataset is characterized with two key properties: 1) fast and variable-speed motion and 2) similar yet distinguishable appearance. We expect SportsMOT to encourage the MOT trackers to promote in both motion-based association and appearance-based association. We benchmark several state-of-the-art trackers and reveal the key challenge of SportsMOT lies in object association. To alleviate the issue, we further propose a new multi-object tracking framework, termed as \emph{MixSort}, introducing a MixFormer-like structure as an auxiliary association model to prevailing tracking-by-detection trackers. By integrating the customized appearance-based association with the original motion-based association, MixSort achieves state-of-the-art performance on SportsMOT and MOT17. Based on MixSort, we give an in-depth analysis and provide some profound insights into SportsMOT. The dataset and code will be available at https://deeperaction.github.io/datasets/sportsmot.html.			arxiv	['Chenkai Zeng', 'Xiaoyu Zhao', 'Yichun Yang', 'Gangshan Wu', 'Limin Wang']	226.0
485	About latent roles in forecasting players in team sports	Luca Scofano	2023-04-17 13:33:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08272v3	Forecasting players in sports has grown in popularity due to the potential for a tactical advantage and the applicability of such research to multi-agent interaction systems. Team sports contain a significant social component that influences interactions between teammates and opponents. However, it still needs to be fully exploited. In this work, we hypothesize that each participant has a specific function in each action and that role-based interaction is critical for predicting players' future moves. We create RolFor, a novel end-to-end model for Role-based Forecasting. RolFor uses a new module we developed called Ordering Neural Networks (OrderNN) to permute the order of the players such that each player is assigned to a latent role. The latent role is then modeled with a RoleGCN. Thanks to its graph representation, it provides a fully learnable adjacency matrix that captures the relationships between roles and is subsequently used to forecast the players' future trajectories. Extensive experiments on a challenging NBA basketball dataset back up the importance of roles and justify our goal of modeling them using optimizable models. When an oracle provides roles, the proposed RolFor compares favorably to the current state-of-the-art (it ranks first in terms of ADE and second in terms of FDE errors). However, training the end-to-end RolFor incurs the issues of differentiability of permutation methods, which we experimentally review. Finally, this work restates differentiable ranking as a difficult open problem and its great potential in conjunction with graph-based interaction models.

Fans consistently hold high expectations for athletes, anticipating exceptional performances week after week. This ongoing phenomenon sometimes gives rise to highly negative sentiments, with the worst-case scenario involving the occurrence of hate speech. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is widely recognized as one of the most popular sports leagues globally. However, an unfortunate aspect that has emerged in recent years is the presence of abusive fans within the league. Consequently, the focus of this research is to identify which NBA athletes experience abuse on Twitter and delve deeper into the underlying reasons behind such mistreatment. To address the research questions at hand, the study employs a curated set of keywords to query the Twitter API, gathering a comprehensive collection of tweets that potentially contain hate speech directed toward NBA players. A deep learning classification model is implemented, effectively identifying tweets that genuinely exhibit hate speech. We further use keyword search methods to detect the specific groups that are targeted by hate speech the most and identify topics of hate speech tweets. The findings of our research indicate that certain groups of athletes are particularly vulnerable to hate speech from fans. Racism, physique shaming, play style, and anti-LGBTQ remarks are the major themes. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of the challenges faced by NBA athletes in the digital space and provide a foundation for developing strategies to combat hate speech and foster a more inclusive environment for all individuals involved in the NBA community.			arxiv	['Samuel Nuamah-Amoabeng', 'Hanjia Lyu', 'Jiebo Luo']	228.0
487	A Spectral Approach for the Dynamic Bradley-Terry Model	Xin-Yu Tian	2023-07-31 13:25:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16642v2	The dynamic ranking, due to its increasing importance in many applications, is becoming crucial, especially with the collection of voluminous time-dependent data. One such application is sports statistics, where dynamic ranking aids in forecasting the performance of competitive teams, drawing on historical and current data. Despite its usefulness, predicting and inferring rankings pose challenges in environments necessitating time-dependent modeling. This paper introduces a spectral ranker called Kernel Rank Centrality, designed to rank items based on pairwise comparisons over time. The ranker operates via kernel smoothing in the Bradley-Terry model, utilizing a Markov chain model. Unlike the maximum likelihood approach, the spectral ranker is nonparametric, demands fewer model assumptions and computations, and allows for real-time ranking. We establish the asymptotic distribution of the ranker by applying an innovative group inverse technique, resulting in a uniform and precise entrywise expansion. This result allows us to devise a new inferential method for predictive inference, previously unavailable in existing approaches. Our numerical examples showcase the ranker's utility in predictive accuracy and constructing an uncertainty measure for prediction, leveraging data from the National Basketball Association (NBA). The results underscore our method's potential compared to the gold standard in sports, the Arpad Elo rating system.			arxiv	['Jian Shi', 'Xiaotong Shen', 'Kai Song']	229.0
488	Optimizing Offensive Gameplan in the National Basketball Association with Machine Learning	Eamon Mukhopadhyay	2023-08-13 22:03:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06851v2	Throughout the analytical revolution that has occurred in the NBA, the development of specific metrics and formulas has given teams, coaches, and players a new way to see the game. However - the question arises - how can we verify any metrics? One method would simply be eyeball approximation (trying out many different gameplans) and/or trial and error - an estimation-based and costly approach. Another approach is to try to model already existing metrics with a unique set of features using machine learning techniques. The key to this approach is that with these features that are selected, we can try to gauge the effectiveness of these features combined, rather than using individual analysis in simple metric evaluation. If we have an accurate model, it can particularly help us determine the specifics of gameplan execution. In this paper, the statistic ORTG (Offensive Rating, developed by Dean Oliver) was found to have a correlation with different NBA playtypes using both a linear regression model and a neural network regression model, although ultimately, a neural network worked slightly better than linear regression. Using the accuracy of the models as a justification, the next step was to optimize the output of the model with test examples, which would demonstrate the combination of features to best achieve a highly functioning offense.			arxiv	[]	230.0
489	Analysis of ELO Rating Scheme in MOBA Games	Yuhan Song	2023-10-18 03:38:41	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13719v1	ELO rating system is proposed by Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-American physics professor. Originally, it was proposed for the ranking system of chess players, but it was soon adapted to many other zero-sum sports fields like football, baseball, basketball , etc. Nowadays, besides the traditional sports games, computer/video games are also playing an important role in social lives especially among the teenagers. In most of the online competition games, player's performance is usually scored and recorded by the game's ranking system. Meanwhile, ranking system like ladder in Dota is not the only the metric for the players to evaluate their gaming strength, an ELO rating score based on players in-game performance is also a decisive factor for gamers' matching. Namely, the matching system will refer to players' score in the ranking system and performance score system to ensure the matched players will promisingly undergo a balanced game without one team dramatically overwhelming the other. ELO scheme and its variants in modern online competition games aims to ensuring the expected winning rate for each team approaches 50\%. However, ELO rating is also causing compliments among players. In this research, I will dig into the advantages and drawbacks of leveraging ELO ranking system in online games and why it is still employed by game developers despite the fact that it is disliked by most of the players. Also, a new effort based rating scheme will be proposed and compared with ELO scheme under the simulation environment.			arxiv	[]	231.0
490	Linking Surface Facts to Large-Scale Knowledge Graphs	Gorjan Radevski	2023-10-23 13:18:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14909v1	"Open Information Extraction (OIE) methods extract facts from natural language text in the form of (""subject""; ""relation""; ""object"") triples. These facts are, however, merely surface forms, the ambiguity of which impedes their downstream usage; e.g., the surface phrase ""Michael Jordan"" may refer to either the former basketball player or the university professor. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), on the other hand, contain facts in a canonical (i.e., unambiguous) form, but their coverage is limited by a static schema (i.e., a fixed set of entities and predicates). To bridge this gap, we need the best of both worlds: (i) high coverage of free-text OIEs, and (ii) semantic precision (i.e., monosemy) of KGs. In order to achieve this goal, we propose a new benchmark with novel evaluation protocols that can, for example, measure fact linking performance on a granular triple slot level, while also measuring if a system has the ability to recognize that a surface form has no match in the existing KG. Our extensive evaluation of several baselines show that detection of out-of-KG entities and predicates is more difficult than accurate linking to existing ones, thus calling for more research efforts on this difficult task. We publicly release all resources (data, benchmark and code) on https://github.com/nec-research/fact-linking."			arxiv	['Kiril Gashteovski', 'Chia-Chien Hung', 'Carolin Lawrence', 'Goran Glavaš']	232.0
491	Improving the Aggregation and Evaluation of NBA Mock Drafts	Jared D. Fisher	2023-10-25 17:43:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16813v1	Many enthusiasts and experts publish forecasts of the order players are drafted into professional sports leagues, known as mock drafts. Using a novel dataset of mock drafts for the National Basketball Association (NBA), we analyze authors' mock draft accuracy over time and ask how we can reasonably use information from multiple authors. To measure how accurate mock drafts are, we assume that both mock drafts and the actual draft are ranked lists, and we propose that rank-biased distance (RBD) of Webber et al. (2010) is the appropriate error metric for mock draft accuracy. This is because RBD allows mock drafts to have a different length than the actual draft, accounts for players not appearing in both lists, and weights errors early in the draft more than errors later on. We validate that mock drafts, as expected, improve in accuracy over the course of a season, and that accuracy of the mock drafts produced right before their drafts is fairly stable across seasons. To be able to combine information from multiple mock drafts into a single consensus mock draft, we also propose a ranked-list combination method based on the ideas of ranked-choice voting. We show that our method provides improved forecasts over the standard Borda count combination method used for most similar analyses in sports, and that either combination method provides a more accurate forecast over time than any single author.			arxiv	['Colin Montague']	233.0

In this study, a Multi-Agent Statistically Discriminative Sub-Trajectory Mining (MA-Stat-DSM) method is proposed that takes a set of binary-labelled agent trajectory matrices as input and incorporates Hausdorff distance to identify sub-matrices that statistically significantly discriminate between the two groups of labelled trajectory matrices. Utilizing 2015/16 SportVU NBA tracking data, agent trajectory matrices representing attacks consisting of the trajectories of five agents (the ball, shooter, last passer, shooter defender, and last passer defender), were truncated to correspond to the time interval following the receipt of the ball by the last passer, and labelled as effective or ineffective based on a definition of attack effectiveness that we devise in the current study. After identifying appropriate parameters for MA-Stat-DSM by iteratively applying it to all matches involving the two top- and two bottom-placed teams from the 2015/16 NBA season, the method was then applied to selected matches and could identify and visualize the portions of plays, e.g., involving passing, on-, and/or off-the-ball movements, which were most relevant in rendering attacks effective or ineffective.			arxiv	['Vo Nguyen Le Duy', 'Yasuo Tabei', 'Ichiro Takeuchi', 'Keisuke Fujii']	234.0

However, accurately estimating the position of a radio transmitter using a remote sensor is not an easy task, as many factors contribute to the highly dynamic behavior of radio signals. In this study, we investigate techniques to use a mobile robot to explore an outdoor area and localize the radio source using sparse Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements. We propose a novel radio source localization method with fast turnaround times and reduced complexity compared to the state-of-the-art. Our technique uses RSSI measurements collected while the robot completed a sparse trajectory using a coverage path planning map. The mean RSSI within each grid cell was used to find the most likely cell containing the source. Three techniques were analyzed with the data from eight field tests using a mobile robot. The proposed method can localize a gas source in a basketball field with a 1.2 m accuracy and within three minutes of convergence time, whereas the state-of-the-art active sensing technique took more than 30 minutes to reach a source estimation accuracy below 1 m.			arxiv	['Vu Phi Tran', 'Sreenatha Anavatti', 'Kathryn Kasmarik', 'Matthew Garratt']	235.0
494	A Networks and Machine Learning Approach to Determine the Best College Coaches of the 20th-21st Centuries	Tian-Shun Jiang	2014-04-08 22:04:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2885v1	Our objective is to find the five best college sports coaches of past century for three different sports. We decided to look at men's basketball, football, and baseball. We wanted to use an approach that could definitively determine team skill from the games played, and then use a machine-learning algorithm to calculate the correct coach skills for each team in a given year. We created a networks-based model to calculate team skill from historical game data. A digraph was created for each year in each sport. Nodes represented teams, and edges represented a game played between two teams. The arrowhead pointed towards the losing team. We calculated the team skill of each graph using a right-hand eigenvector centrality measure. This way, teams that beat good teams will be ranked higher than teams that beat mediocre teams. The eigenvector centrality rankings for most years were well correlated with tournament performance and poll-based rankings. We assumed that the relationship between coach skill $C_s$, player skill $P_s$, and team skill $T_s$ was $C_s \cdot P_s = T_s$. We then created a function to describe the probability that a given score difference would occur based on player skill and coach skill. We multiplied the probabilities of all edges in the network together to find the probability that the correct network would occur with any given player skill and coach skill matrix. We was able to determine player skill as a function of team skill and coach skill, eliminating the need to optimize two unknown matrices. The top five coaches in each year were noted, and the top coach of all time was calculated by dividing the number of times that coach ranked in the yearly top five by the years said coach had been active.			arxiv	['Zachary Polizzi', 'Christopher Yuan']	236.0

The present work focuses on performing visual analytics to evaluate the value of any kind of event occurring in a sports match with a continuous parameter space. Here, the continuous parameter space involves the time, location, score, and other parameters. Because the spatiotemporal data used in such analytics is a low-level representation and has a very large size, however, traditional analytics may need to discretize the continuous parameter space (e.g., subdivide the playing area) or use a local feature to limit the analysis to specific events (e.g., only shots). These approaches make evaluation impossible for any kind of event with a continuous parameter space. To solve this problem, we consider a whole match as a Markov chain of significant events, so that event values can be estimated with a continuous parameter space by solving the Markov chain with a machine learning model. The significant events are first extracted by considering the time-varying distribution of players to represent the whole match. Then, the extracted events are redefined as different states with the continuous parameter space and built as a Markov chain so that a Markov reward process can be applied. Finally, the Markov reward process is solved by a customized fitted-value iteration algorithm so that the event values with the continuous parameter space can be predicted by a regression model. As a result, the event values can be visually inspected over the whole playing field under arbitrary given conditions. Experimental results with real soccer data show the effectiveness of the proposed system.			arxiv	['Takayuki Osogami', 'Tetsuro Morimura']	237.0
496	The Advantage of Playing Home in NBA: Microscopic, Team-Specific and Evolving Features	Haroldo V. Ribeiro	2016-03-25 18:57:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08821v1	The idea that the success rate of a team increases when playing home is broadly accepted and documented for a wide variety of sports. Investigations on the so-called home advantage phenomenon date back to the 70's and every since has attracted the attention of scholars and sport enthusiasts. These studies have been mainly focused on identifying the phenomenon and trying to correlate it with external factors such as crowd noise and referee bias. Much less is known about the effects of home advantage in the microscopic dynamics of the game (within the game) or possible team-specific and evolving features of this phenomenon. Here we present a detailed study of these previous features in the National Basketball Association (NBA). By analyzing play-by-play events of more than sixteen thousand games that span thirteen NBA seasons, we have found that home advantage affects the microscopic dynamics of the game by increasing the scoring rates and decreasing the time intervals between scores of teams playing home. We verified that these two features are different among the NBA teams, for instance, the scoring rate of the Cleveland Cavaliers team is increased 0.16 points per minute (on average the seasons 2004-05 to 2013-14) when playing home, whereas for the New Jersey Nets (now the Brooklyn Nets) this rate increases in only 0.04 points per minute. We further observed that these microscopic features have evolved over time in a non-trivial manner when analyzing the results team-by-team. However, after averaging over all teams some regularities emerge; in particular, we noticed that the average differences in the scoring rates and in the characteristic times (related to the time intervals between scores) have slightly decreased over time, suggesting a weakening of the phenomenon.			arxiv	['Satyam Mukherjee', 'Xiao Han T.

497	Game Plan: What AI can do for Football, and What Football can do for AI	Karl Tuyls	2020-11-18 10:26:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09192v1	The rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has opened unprecedented analytics possibilities in various team and individual sports, including baseball, basketball, and tennis. More recently, AI techniques have been applied to football, due to a huge increase in data collection by professional teams, increased computational power, and advances in machine learning, with the goal of better addressing new scientific challenges involved in the analysis of both individual players' and coordinated teams' behaviors. The research challenges associated with predictive and prescriptive football analytics require new developments and progress at the intersection of statistical learning, game theory, and computer vision. In this paper, we provide an overarching perspective highlighting how the combination of these fields, in particular, forms a unique microcosm for AI research, while offering mutual benefits for professional teams, spectators, and broadcasters in the years to come. We illustrate that this duality makes football analytics a game changer of tremendous value, in terms of not only changing the game of football itself, but also in terms of what this domain can mean for the field of AI. We review the state-of-the-art and exemplify the types of analysis enabled by combining the aforementioned fields, including illustrative examples of counterfactual analysis using predictive models, and the combination of game-theoretic analysis of penalty kicks with statistical learning of player attributes. We conclude by highlighting envisioned downstream impacts, including possibilities for extensions to other sports (real and virtual).			arxiv	['Shayegan Omidshafiei', 'Paul Muller', 'Zhe Wang', 'Jerome Connor', 'Daniel Hennes', 'Ian Graham', 'William Spearman', 'Tim Waskett', 'Dafydd Steele', 'Pauline Luc', 'Adria Recasens', 'Alexandre Galashov', 'Gregory Thornton', 'Romuald Elie', 'Pablo Sprechmann', 'Pol Moreno', 'Kris Cao', 'Marta Garnelo', 'Praneet Dutta', 'Michal Valko', 'Nicolas Heess', 'Alex Bridgland', 'Julien Perolat', 'Bart De Vylder', 'Ali Eslami', 'Mark Rowland', 'Andrew Jaegle', 'Remi Munos', 'Trevor Back', 'Razia Ahamed', 'Simon Bouton', 'Nathalie Beauguerlange', 'Jackson Broshear', 'Thore Graepel', 'Demis Hassabis']	239.0
498	The Anatomy of Corner 3s in the NBA: What makes them efficient, how are they generated and how can defenses respond?	Konstantinos Pelechrinis	2021-05-26 18:37:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12785v1	Modern basketball is all about creating efficient shots, that is, shots with high payoff. This is not necessarily equivalent to creating looks with the highest probability of success. In particular, the two most efficient shots in the NBA - which are shots from the paint, i.e., extremely close to the basket, and three-point shots from the corner, i.e., at least 22 feet apart - have completely different spatial profiles when it comes to their distance from the basket. The latter also means that they are pretty much at the opposing ends of the spectrum when it comes to their probability of being made. Due to their efficiency, these are the most sought after shots from the offense, while the defense is trying to contain them. However, in order to contain them one needs to first understand what makes them efficient in the first place and how they are generated. In this study we focus on the corner three point shots and using player tracking data we show that the main factor for their efficiency - contrary to the belief from the sports mass media - is not the shorter distance to the basket compared to three-point shots above the break, but rather the fact that they are assisted at a very high rate (more than 90\%). Furthermore, we analyze the movement of the shooter and his defender and find that more than half of these shots involve a shooter anchored at the corner waiting for the kick out pass. We finally define a simplified game between the offense and defense in these situation and we find that the Nash Equilibrium supports either committing to the corner shooter or to the drive to the basket, and not lingering between the two, which is what we observed from the defenses in our dataset.			arxiv	['Kirk Goldsberry']	240.0
499	PGD: A Large-scale Professional Go Dataset for Data-driven Analytics	Yifan Gao	2022-04-30 12:53:04	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00254v1	Lee Sedol is on a winning streak--does this legend rise again after the competition with AlphaGo? Ke Jie is invincible in the world championship--can he still win the title this time? Go is one of the most popular board games in East Asia, with a stable professional sports system that has lasted for decades in China, Japan, and Korea. There are mature data-driven analysis technologies for many sports, such as soccer, basketball, and esports. However, developing such technology for Go remains nontrivial and challenging due to the lack of datasets, meta-information, and in-game statistics. This paper creates the Professional Go Dataset (PGD), containing 98,043 games played by 2,148 professional players from 1950 to 2021. After manual cleaning and labeling, we provide detailed meta-information for each player, game, and tournament. Moreover, the dataset includes analysis results for each move in the match evaluated by advanced AlphaZero-based AI. To establish a benchmark for PGD, we further analyze the data and extract meaningful in-game features based on prior knowledge related to Go that can indicate the game status. With the help of complete meta-information and constructed in-game features, our results prediction system achieves an accuracy of 75.30%, much higher than several state-of-the-art approaches (64%-65%). As far as we know, PGD is the first dataset for data-driven analytics in Go and even in board games. Beyond this promising result, we provide more examples of tasks that benefit from our dataset. The ultimate goal of this paper is to bridge this ancient game and the modern data science community. It will advance research on Go-related analytics to enhance the fan experience, help players improve their ability, and facilitate other promising aspects. The dataset will be made publicly available.			arxiv	[]	241.0
