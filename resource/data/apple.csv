1	QuickScan is in v8! - My 100% free iOS scanner with OCR (text recognition) gets a major update. Still no ads, no data collection, no subs, donation-based. Now with Folders, Signatures import, improved scan quality, Interactive Widgets, improved Export Favorites (paperless-ngx), auto filename, ...	Unknown	2024-01-07 07:17:03	https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/190mkuf/quickscan_is_in_v8_my_100_free_ios_scanner_with/	üëã, almost 4 years ago, during lockdown, I created QuickScan, a free iOS scanner (with OCR), to help people who cannot afford the right tools to study/work from home. 2 years ago I posted here about the v4, a major update with a brand new user interface which set the foundation for many new features to come. 1+ year ago came v5 then v6 adding widgets, shortcuts, improved OCR, automation, and a lot more. Last December, I released v7 which brought the so useful Export Favorite functionality that has been so well received. 6 months ago came v7.5 with the signing documents feature, FaceID document protection, and more‚Ä¶ Thank you all for the incredible feedback so far!! This is amazing! [Link to QuickScan v8 on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1513790291) Today, I‚Äôd like to talk about the just released v8, and everything that has been added since v7. I put a lot of work into it, motivated by all your nice feedback.I believe now, more than ever, that it can compete with the expensive scanner apps out there. But of course, you'll be the judge of that. Anyway, it's still free, without any ads and without any data collection. Everything happens on your device.I supported the development costs myself, with the help of donations by generous users. # What‚Äôs new in v8: * Folders: QuickScan finally welcomes a useful folder hierarchy. And with automation, you can even have your Export Favorite place your scans in a preconfigured folder. * Export Favorites: Configure multiple favorite export destination with custom settings (color/black&white/export format/file name/OCR/auto-delete/‚Ä¶) ‚û°Ô∏è Now with paperless-ngx support. * Signatures: Import existing signatures, from a photo/image/PDF, or by using your device‚Äôs camera to take a photo of an handwritten signature! And then of course, you can apply them on your documents. Before you could only draw a signature with your finger. * Improved scan quality, making text more visible and sharper * Many improvements all over the app: performance ++, design, ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd like to tell you a bit more about the advanced automation features, with a great example illustrating the possibilities: You can now accomplish an end-to-end process: scan your document > press save >>> your document is automatically: 1. OCR‚Äôd, with the recognized text integrated into the created PDF (search/select/copy&paste in the PDF) 2. named based on a predefined pattern 3. transformed into black&white/grayscale/colors/.., and resolution/quality adjusted 4. uploaded to your favorite location 5. deleted from your scan list on your device (optional), or placed in a preconfigured folder in QuickScan‚Ä¶ and all this happened by just pressing ‚Äòsave‚Äô. That is a real time saver. And with **‚ÄòScan To‚Äô widgets/shortcuts**: * You configure a widget/shortcut to be associated with an Export Favorite * Start a scan using a specific widget/shortcut * All the automation described above will be done according to the Export Favorite associated to the widget/shortcut Example : Scan To work, Scan To my family drive, Scan To receipts, Send by mail to my boss‚Ä¶ # QuickScan key features are: * Scan with your device's camera (with automatic edges detection and automatic angle correction) * Import existing PDF (from Files) or existing photos (from Files/Photos) or from any app (QuickScan integrates into the iOS Share Sheet). You can even combine them (also with scans) into one document. You can also reorder the pages with a nicely animated Drag & Drop. QuickScan can detect edges and deskew any imported image. * Scan history: the app keeps (on device) a list (with optional folders) of your previous scans such that they remain available for whenever you need them. With the recently deleted section, you avoid deleting precious scans by accident. * **Recognize text (OCR)** on anything (scans / photos / PDF). Language can be detected automatically. Happens on-device. * **Integrate the recognized text into the exported PDF such that it becomes searchable** (search/select/copy & paste) when you open it with any PDF reader. Yes!! * Export to .TXT (text), .JPG (images), or to searchable .PDF (as detailed previously) * PDF password protection: protect your PDF with a password. Anyone trying to open the file needs the password. * **Automatic file naming**: configure a pattern with date/time/text/counter that suits your needs, and your scans will be named accordingly * Apply filters (colors, grayscale, B&W, size, compression) on images and instantly preview the output file size. You can also crop / rotate the pages. * Document enhancer: improve scan quality for documents by removing shadows, making text sharper and more visible, ‚Ä¶ * Preview the OCR results and copy them to the pasteboard * Configure **Export Favorites**, such that when you export the scan, it directly saves it in the configured folder (or email) with specific settings. This one is a real time saver. * **Cloud upload**: iCloud Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive/Google Drive/**WebDAV**/pCloud/NAS (Synology, Nextcloud‚Ä¶)/SMB/SD/**Email**/**paperless-ngx...** and more via WebDAV (DEVONthink...) * Configure the PDF print size (A4, US Letter, ...) * Siri shortcuts that can be configured with an Export Favorite * Home & Lock screen **widgets** that can be configured **with an Export Favorite**, or interactive widget to choose the Favorite right from your home/lock screen * **Automation** (auto-export, auto-delete, auto-smart-filename, ‚Ä¶) * **Signatures** (sign documents on the fly with preconfigured signatures, drawn or imported) * Document & signatures protection with **Face ID** / Touch ID * **Zero data collection policy**: Everything happens locally, on your device. No server. Your data is safe and your privacy matters. It's built for, and only for iOS. This makes the experience of using it so much better. I hope you like the app, and that it will continue to reach the people in-need for a free scanner for their studies/work/whatever. The in-app purchases are donations, for the people who can afford to support the project ‚ò∫Ô∏è. And yes - because some will ask - there are some incentives in the app to donate (like changing the app colors or disabling donation demands. All are non-essential.). Why? it‚Äôs been almost 4 years of development, and the great majority of the costs are on me, the rest comes from donations. Help on that part is consequently appreciated. Your feedback & support is VERY welcome, I love and will continue to improve the app based on your amazing suggestions. Was my post too long? I understand, then just test the app and tell me what you think ‚ò∫Ô∏è. [Link to QuickScan v8 on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1513790291) I wish you all a happy new year üéâü•≥, and can‚Äôt wait to bring more updates to the app (I am already working on new features).	13.0	t3_190mkuf	reddit

Like many others, I spend way too much time mindlessly scrolling through my phone and not enough time doing things beneficial to me, like exercising, being outside and being present. After calculating how much time I was due to spend on my phone over my lifetime (around 24 years! ü§¢) and seeing my average daily steps taking a steady decline, I decided to build something to try and combat this. Introducing... # Fitlock FitLock is a highly customisable app blocker that uses Apple Health and Screen Time to unlock whichever selection of apps you decide for a specified time whenever you reach your fitness goal via a number of different health metrics. Currently, you can set goals with step count, calorie count, exercise time, stand time, cycle distance and move distance. However, the plan is to add more in the future with the addition of support for wheelchair users. Some examples of schedules you could create are: Unlock Instagram & TikTok for 30 minutes each time you hit 2000 steps in a day, or, unlock a food delivery service on Friday if you complete an hour of exercise. # Features **Schedules**: Create multiple fully customisable schedules to fit around your routine. **Block Any App**: Fitlock uses Apple's Screen Time API to block any you choose. **Secure Data**: No data used on this app is stored or shared with anyone, it all remains private and secure on your device. Screen time and app data is also sandboxed by Apple, so I couldn't look at it even if I wanted to. **Health Goals**: Create fully customisable health goals to fit your personal goals utilising Apple Health. **Health Goal Progress**: Display your current health goal progress when viewing a blocked app. **Suggested Goals**: Calculates your current activity levels for your selected health goal and suggest recommended levels for your apps unlock time. **Statistics**: Displays analytics of your current screen time for each app and your current activity levels to compare how you are progressing. **Notifications**: Receive notifications when your schedules have started, ended, and when you have unlocked some app viewing time. **Strict Mode**: Prevent yourself from being able to opt out of the schedule by stopping the ability of editing a schedule while it is active and removing the ability to delete any applications. **Moderate Mode**: Block apps until health goals are reached, but if you'd really like to change the schedule while it is active, you can. **Lenient Mode**: You are still presented with your current health goal progress when attempting to open a blocked app, but if you'd like to unlock the app for an extra 10 minutes, you can. **Light/Dark Mode**: Use Fitlock with a beautiful dark or light mode depending on your preferences. **No Account Creation**: Data is all stored on your device and no account creation is required to use Fitlock.

10	Localizing Small Apples in Complex Apple Orchard Environments	Christian Wilms	2022-02-23 09:25:37	http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11372v1	The localization of fruits is an essential first step in automated agricultural pipelines for yield estimation or fruit picking. One example of this is the localization of apples in images of entire apple trees. Since the apples are very small objects in such scenarios, we tackle this problem by adapting the object proposal generation system AttentionMask that focuses on small objects. We adapt AttentionMask by either adding a new module for very small apples or integrating it into a tiling framework. Both approaches clearly outperform standard object proposal generation systems on the MinneApple dataset covering complex apple orchard environments. Our evaluation further analyses the improvement w.r.t. the apple sizes and shows the different characteristics of our two approaches.			arxiv	['Robert Johanson', 'Simone Frintrop']	0.0
11	Design of an Intelligent Vision Algorithm for Recognition and Classification of Apples in an Orchard Scene	Hamid Majidi Balanji	2021-10-07 07:31:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03232v1	Apple is one of the remarkable fresh fruit that contains a high degree of nutritious and medicinal value. Hand harvesting of apples by seasonal farmworkers increases physical damages on the surface of these fruits, which causes a great loss in marketing quality. The main objective of this study is focused on designing a robust vision algorithm for robotic apple harvesters. The proposed algorithm is able to recognize and classify 4-classes of objects found in an orchard scene including apples, leaves, trunk and branches, and sky into two apples and non-apples classes. 100 digital images of Red Delicious apples and 100 digital images of Golden Delicious apples were selected among 1000 captured images of apples from 18 apple gardens in West Azerbaijan, Iran. An image processing algorithm is proposed for segmentation and extraction of the image classes based on the color characteristics of mentioned classes. Invariant-Momentums were chosen as the extracted features from the segmented classes, e.g. apples. Multilayer Feedforward Neural Networks, MFNNs, were used as an artificial intelligence tool for the recognition and classification of image classes.			arxiv	['Alaeedin Rahmani Didar', 'Mohamadali Hadad Derafshi']	1.0
12	O2RNet: Occluder-Occludee Relational Network for Robust Apple Detection in Clustered Orchard Environments	Pengyu Chu	2023-03-08 20:46:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04884v1	Automated apple harvesting has attracted significant research interest in recent years due to its potential to revolutionize the apple industry, addressing the issues of shortage and high costs in labor. One key technology to fully enable efficient automated harvesting is accurate and robust apple detection, which is challenging due to complex orchard environments that involve varying lighting conditions and foliage/branch occlusions. Furthermore, clustered apples are common in the orchard, which brings additional challenges as the clustered apples may be identified as one apple. This will cause issues in localization for subsequent robotic operations. In this paper, we present the development of a novel deep learning-based apple detection framework, Occluder-Occludee Relational Network (O2RNet), for robust detection of apples in such clustered environments. This network exploits the occuluder-occludee relationship modeling head by introducing a feature expansion structure to enable the combination of layered traditional detectors to split clustered apples and foliage occlusions. More specifically, we collect a comprehensive apple orchard image dataset under different lighting conditions (overcast, front lighting, and back lighting) with frequent apple occlusions. We then develop a novel occlusion-aware network for apple detection, in which a feature expansion structure is incorporated into the convolutional neural networks to extract additional features generated by the original network for occluded apples. Comprehensive evaluations are performed, which show that the developed O2RNet outperforms state-of-the-art models with a higher accuracy of 94\% and a higher F1-score of 0.88 on apple detection.			arxiv	['Zhaojian Li', 'Kaixiang Zhang', 'Dong Chen', 'Kyle Lammers', 'Renfu Lu']	2.0

Particularly used for Apple iOS, sandboxing prevents apps from executing potentially dangerous actions, by defining rules in a sandbox profile. Investigating Apple's built-in sandbox profiles is difficult as they are compiled and stored in binary format. We present SandBlaster, a software bundle that is able to reverse/decompile Apple binary sandbox profiles to their original human readable SBPL (SandBox Profile Language) format. We use SandBlaster to reverse all built-in Apple iOS binary sandbox profiles for iOS 7, 8 and 9. Our tool is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to provide a full reversing of the Apple sandbox, shedding light into the inner workings of Apple sandbox profiles and providing essential support for security researchers and professionals interested in Apple security mechanisms.			arxiv	['Luke Deshotels', 'Mihai Bucicoiu', 'William Enck', 'Lucas Davi', 'Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi']	4.0

16	Real-Time Apple Detection System Using Embedded Systems With Hardware Accelerators: An Edge AI Application	Vittorio Mazzia	2020-04-28 10:40:01	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13410v1	"Real-time apple detection in orchards is one of the most effective ways of estimating apple yields, which helps in managing apple supplies more effectively. Traditional detection methods used highly computational machine learning algorithms with intensive hardware set up, which are not suitable for infield real-time apple detection due to their weight and power constraints. In this study, a real-time embedded solution inspired from ""Edge AI"" is proposed for apple detection with the implementation of YOLOv3-tiny algorithm on various embedded platforms such as Raspberry Pi 3 B+ in combination with Intel Movidius Neural Computing Stick (NCS), Nvidia's Jetson Nano and Jetson AGX Xavier. Data set for training were compiled using acquired images during field survey of apple orchard situated in the north region of Italy, and images used for testing were taken from widely used google data set by filtering out the images containing apples in different scenes to ensure the robustness of the algorithm. The proposed study adapts YOLOv3-tiny architecture to detect small objects. It shows the feasibility of deployment of the customized model on cheap and power-efficient embedded hardware without compromising mean average detection accuracy (83.64%) and achieved frame rate up to 30 fps even for the difficult scenarios such as overlapping apples, complex background, less exposure of apple due to leaves and branches. Furthermore, the proposed embedded solution can be deployed on the unmanned ground vehicles to detect, count, and measure the size of the apples in real-time to help the farmers and agronomists in their decision making and management skills."			arxiv	['Francesco Salvetti', 'Aleem Khaliq', 'Marcello Chiaberge']	6.0

One key enabling technology towards automated harvesting is accurate and robust apple detection, which poses great challenges as a result of the complex orchard environment that involves varying lighting conditions and foliage/branch occlusions. This letter reports on the development of a novel deep learning-based apple detection framework named DeepApple. Specifically, we first collect a comprehensive apple orchard dataset for 'Gala' and 'Blondee' apples, using a color camera, under different lighting conditions (sunny vs. overcast and front lighting vs. back lighting). We then develop a novel suppression Mask R-CNN for apple detection, in which a suppression branch is added to the standard Mask R-CNN to suppress non-apple features generated by the original network. Comprehensive evaluations are performed, which show that the developed suppression Mask R-CNN network outperforms state-of-the-art models with a higher F1-score of 0.905 and a detection time of 0.25 second per frame on a standard desktop computer.			arxiv	['Zhaojian Li', 'Kyle Lammers', 'Renfu Lu', 'Xiaoming Liu']	7.0
18	Assigning Apples to Individual Trees in Dense Orchards using 3D Color Point Clouds	Mouad Zine-El-Abidine	2020-12-26 11:28:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13721v1	We propose a 3D color point cloud processing pipeline to count apples on individual apple trees in trellis structured orchards. Fruit counting at the tree level requires separating trees, which is challenging in dense orchards. We employ point clouds acquired from the leaf-off orchard in winter period, where the branch structure is visible, to delineate tree crowns. We localize apples in point clouds acquired in harvest period. Alignment of the two point clouds enables mapping apple locations to the delineated winter cloud and assigning each apple to its bearing tree. Our apple assignment method achieves an accuracy rate higher than 95%. In addition to presenting a first proof of feasibility, we also provide suggestions for further improvement on our apple assignment pipeline.			arxiv	['Helin Dutagaci', 'Gilles Galopin', 'David Rousseau']	8.0

While Apple provides a stalking detection feature within its ecosystem, billions of Android users are still left in the dark. Apple recently released the Android app ""Tracker Detect,"" which does not deliver a convincing feature set for stalking protection. We reverse engineer Apple's tracking protection in iOS and discuss its features regarding stalking detection.

29	AirGuard -- Protecting Android Users From Stalking Attacks By Apple Find My Devices	Alexander Heinrich	2022-02-23 22:31:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11813v1	"Finder networks in general, and Apple's Find My network in particular, can pose a grave threat to users' privacy and even health if these networks are abused for stalking. Apple's release of the AirTag, a very affordable tracker covered by the nearly ubiquitous Find My network, amplified this issue. While Apple provides a stalking detection feature within its ecosystem, billions of Android users are still left in the dark. Apple recently released the Android app ""Tracker Detect,"" which does not deliver a convincing feature set for stalking protection. We reverse engineer Apple's tracking protection in iOS and discuss its features regarding stalking detection. We design ""AirGuard"" and release it as an Android app to protect against abuse by Apple tracking devices. We compare the performance of our solution with the Apple-provided one in iOS and study the use of AirGuard in the wild over multiple weeks using data contributed by tens of thousands of active users."			arxiv	['Niklas Bittner', 'Matthias Hollick']	9.0
30	Specific heat of apple at different moisture contents and temperatures	Viacheslav Mykhailyk	2013-05-06 21:57:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1340v2	This work discusses results of experimental investigations of the specific heat, $C$, of apple in a wide interval of moisture contents ($W=0-0.9$) and temperatures ($T = 283-363$ K). The obtained data reveal the important role of the bound water in determination of $C(W,T)$ behaviour. The additive model for description of $C(W)$ dependence in the moisture range of $0.1<W<1.0$ was applied, where the apple was considered as a mixture of water and hydrated apple material (water plasticised apple) with specific heat $C_h$. The difference between $C_h$ and specific heat of dry apple, $\Delta Cb=C_h-C_d$, was proposed as a measure of the excess contribution of bound water to the specific heat. The estimated amounts of bound water $W_b$ were comparable with the monolayer moisture content in apple. The analytical equation was proposed for approximation of $C(W,T)$ dependencies in the studied intervals of moisture content and temperature.			arxiv	['Nikolai Lebovka']	10.0
31	Stem-Calyx Recognition of an Apple using Shape Descriptors	S. H. Mohana	2015-01-06 05:51:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01083v1	This paper presents a novel method to recognize stem - calyx of an apple using shape descriptors. The main drawback of existing apple grading techniques is that stem - calyx part of an apple is treated as defects, this leads to poor grading of apples. In order to overcome this drawback, we proposed an approach to recognize stem-calyx and differentiated from true defects based on shape features. Our method comprises of steps such as segmentation of apple using grow-cut method, candidate objects such as stem-calyx and small defects are detected using multi-threshold segmentation. The shape features are extracted from detected objects using Multifractal, Fourier and Radon descriptor and finally stem-calyx regions are recognized and differentiated from true defects using SVM classifier. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using experiments conducted on apple image dataset and results exhibit considerable improvement in recognition of stem-calyx region compared to other techniques.			arxiv	['C.

32	System Design and Control of an Apple Harvesting Robot	Kaixiang Zhang	2020-10-21 20:15:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11296v1	There is a growing need for robotic apple harvesting due to decreasing availability and rising cost in labor. Towards the goal of developing a viable robotic system for apple harvesting, this paper presents synergistic mechatronic design and motion control of a robotic apple harvesting prototype, which lays a critical foundation for future advancements. Specifically, we develop a deep learning-based fruit detection and localization system using an RGB-D camera. A three degree-of-freedom manipulator is then designed with a hybrid pneumatic/motor actuation mechanism to achieve fast and dexterous movements. A vacuum-based end-effector is used for apple detaching. These three components are integrated into a robotic apple harvesting prototype with simplicity, compactness, and robustness. Moreover, a nonlinear velocity-based control scheme is developed for the manipulator to achieve accurate and agile motion control. Test experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the developed apple harvesting robot.			arxiv	['Kyle Lammers', 'Pengyu Chu', 'Zhaojian Li', 'Renfu Lu']	12.0
33	S$^3$AD: Semi-supervised Small Apple Detection in Orchard Environments	Robert Johanson	2023-11-08 21:25:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05029v1	Crop detection is integral for precision agriculture applications such as automated yield estimation or fruit picking. However, crop detection, e.g., apple detection in orchard environments remains challenging due to a lack of large-scale datasets and the small relative size of the crops in the image. In this work, we address these challenges by reformulating the apple detection task in a semi-supervised manner. To this end, we provide the large, high-resolution dataset MAD comprising 105 labeled images with 14,667 annotated apple instances and 4,440 unlabeled images. Utilizing this dataset, we also propose a novel Semi-Supervised Small Apple Detection system S$^3$AD based on contextual attention and selective tiling to improve the challenging detection of small apples, while limiting the computational overhead. We conduct an extensive evaluation on MAD and the MSU dataset, showing that S$^3$AD substantially outperforms strong fully-supervised baselines, including several small object detection systems, by up to $14.9\%$. Additionally, we exploit the detailed annotations of our dataset w.r.t. apple properties to analyze the influence of relative size or level of occlusion on the results of various systems, quantifying current challenges.			arxiv	['Christian Wilms', 'Ole Johannsen', 'Simone Frintrop']	13.0
