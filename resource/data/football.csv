0	Football is becoming more predictable; Network analysis of 88 thousands matches in 11 major leagues	Victor Martins Maimone	2019-08-23 19:25:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08991v2	In recent years excessive monetization of football and professionalism among the players has been argued to have affected the quality of the match in different ways. On the one hand, playing football has become a high-income profession and the players are highly motivated; on the other hand, stronger teams have higher incomes and therefore afford better players leading to an even stronger appearance in tournaments that can make the game more imbalanced and hence predictable. To quantify and document this observation, in this work we take a minimalist network science approach to measure the predictability of football over 26 years in major European leagues. We show that over time, the games in major leagues have indeed become more predictable. We provide further support for this observation by showing that inequality between teams has increased and the home-field advantage has been vanishing ubiquitously. We do not include any direct analysis on the effects of monetization on football's predictability or therefore, lack of excitement, however, we propose several hypotheses which could be tested in future analyses.

1	Do people actually underrate Inter players?	:SerieA:Serie A	2024-01-03 12:47:29	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18ximg5/do_people_actually_underrate_inter_players/	For example: When people talk about the best signings of the summer window. I hear names like Kane, Bellingham and Rice etc. But no one mentioned the free signing Thuram, who has 13 G/A overall. Or last year when Osimhen was hitting his best form and became the Top Scorer of Serie A, people are comparing him to Haaland. But this season when Lautaro scored 15 Goals in 16 Games. People just ignore it. So my question is do people underrate Inter Players, when yes, why?			reddit	36.0	t3_18ximg5
2	Why does no one mention how the camera angle of stadium play an important role on the quality of the game?	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-03 19:59:39	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18xsg8w/why_does_no_one_mention_how_the_camera_angle_of/	Probably an unpopular opinion here and I haven't seen someone mention it before, but some of the things that annoys me is when they decide to change the camera angle of a stadium at the start of the season There are some stadiums that I enjoyed how they were broadcasted, but when they changed the angle it just became a bit weird * Anfield * Lyon stadium * Old tottenham stadium * Anoeta, and probably most of spanish stadiums around 2018 I just don't like that trend, and there are some stadiums that are classic and will be weird to have a different camera angle for it * Old trafford * Stamford bridge * Goodison park , etc.. Did you also notice that and find it a bit annoying?			reddit	8.0	t3_18xsg8w
3	A Reinforcement Learning Based Approach to Play Calling in Football	Preston Biro	2021-03-11 20:23:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06939v1	With the vast amount of data collected on football and the growth of computing abilities, many games involving decision choices can be optimized. The underlying rule is the maximization of an expected utility of outcomes and the law of large numbers. The data available allows us to compute with high accuracy the probabilities of outcomes of decisions and the well defined points system in the game allows us to have the necessary terminal utilities. With some well established theory we can then optimize choices at a single play level.	['Stephen G. Walker']	73.0	arxiv		
4	"Origin of the phrase ""he leapt like a salmon"""	Unknown	2024-01-04 22:30:50	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18yq0or/origin_of_the_phrase_he_leapt_like_a_salmon/	I have heard a few people use this comparison for when a player gets some great air getting their head on the ball. I have tried to track down some sort of origin for this phrase being popularised, but I am coming up short. Can anyone think of an interview with a player or commentator who has used this phrase? Or does anyone have any other example that we might be able pin the popularisation of this phrase to?			reddit	0.0	t3_18yq0or
5	Google Research Football: A Novel Reinforcement Learning Environment	Karol Kurach	2019-07-25 16:39:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11180v2	Recent progress in the field of reinforcement learning has been accelerated by virtual learning environments such as video games, where novel algorithms and ideas can be quickly tested in a safe and reproducible manner. We introduce the Google Research Football Environment, a new reinforcement learning environment where agents are trained to play football in an advanced, physics-based 3D simulator. The resulting environment is challenging, easy to use and customize, and it is available under a permissive open-source license. In addition, it provides support for multiplayer and multi-agent experiments. We propose three full-game scenarios of varying difficulty with the Football Benchmarks and report baseline results for three commonly used reinforcement algorithms (IMPALA, PPO, and Ape-X DQN). We also provide a diverse set of simpler scenarios with the Football Academy and showcase several promising research directions.

8	A Bayesian Mean-Value Approach with a Self-Consistently Determined Prior Distribution for the Ranking of College Football Teams	James R. Ashburn	2006-07-07 03:42:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0607064v2	We introduce a Bayesian mean-value approach for ranking all college football teams using only win-loss data. This approach is unique in that the prior distribution necessary to handle undefeated and winless teams is calculated self-consistently. Furthermore, we will show statistics supporting the validity of the prior distribution. Finally, a brief comparison with other football rankings will be presented.	['Paul M. Colvert']	18.0	arxiv

10	Here's why I think Kylian Mbappe should move to Liverpool and its the only correct move for competitive balance in world football.	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-06 08:32:26	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18zvhji/heres_why_i_think_kylian_mbappe_should_move_to/	Here's why I think Mbappe should move to Liverpool and its the only correct move for competitive balance in world football: 1. Bayern will never sanction a move for him, and I don't think Mbappe wants to go from one horse league to another. 2. Barca are broke, Atletico are not prestigious enough. 3. Serie A clubs like Juve, Inter, Milan also do not posses the financial muscle to afford him. 4. That leaves the PL clubs, among which United/Chelsea are too shit for him to consider, City has his rival Haaland playing, Arsenal has FFP issues, Spurs/Newcastle are not gonna entice him and that leaves only Liverpool! So its either moving to Madrid, staying at PSG or coming to Liverpool: 1. Scenario - stays at PSG: He's reaching the ceiling of his potential to grow in Ligue 1 away from worldwide attention and he needs to move in order to evolve as well as start increasing his legacy as a player if he truly wants to contend for one of the greatest players of all-time. 2. Scenario - comes to Liverpool: He will play in the most popular league in the world, with his rival Haaland against him for another title winning side of Man City, its the perfect blockbuster. --- Now comes the nightmare final scenario - Goes to Real Madrid: This is the last straw that will break things apart. If he goes there, then there is no side stopping Madrid to completely decimate the Europe for a decade to come. Real Madrid will have these players under their disposal if things go according to plan: - Mbappe (25) - Vini (23) - Rodrygo (23) - Endrick (17) - Bellingham (20) - Guler (18) - Valverde (25) - Tchouameni (23) - Camavinga (20) - Militao (25) - Davies (23) ? - Yoro (18) ? How is anyone in their wildest dream can compete against this monster team that will all come in their prime together while gelling on chemistry for decade to come? It will ruin the Champions League forever to Mercedes F1 levels. Mbappe, has to come to Liverpool.			reddit	30.0	t3_18zvhji
11	Distinguishing Between Roles of Football Players in Play-by-play Match Event Data	Bart Aalbers	2018-09-13 20:43:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05173v1	Over the last few decades, the player recruitment process in professional football has evolved into a multi-billion industry and has thus become of vital importance. To gain insights into the general level of their candidate reinforcements, many professional football clubs have access to extensive video footage and advanced statistics. However, the question whether a given player would fit the team's playing style often still remains unanswered. In this paper, we aim to bridge that gap by proposing a set of 21 player roles and introducing a method for automatically identifying the most applicable roles for each player from play-by-play event data collected during matches.

13	Design and Implementation of A Soccer Ball Detection System with Multiple Cameras	Lei Li	2023-01-31 22:04:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00123v1	The detection of small and medium-sized objects in three dimensions has always been a frontier exploration problem. This technology has a very wide application in sports analysis, games, virtual reality, human animation and other fields. The traditional three-dimensional small target detection technology has the disadvantages of high cost, low precision and inconvenience, so it is difficult to apply in practice. With the development of machine learning and deep learning, the technology of computer vision algorithms is becoming more mature. Creating an immersive media experience is considered to be a very important research work in sports. The main work is to explore and solve the problem of football detection under the multiple cameras, aiming at the research and implementation of the live broadcast system of football matches. Using multi cameras detects a target ball and determines its position in three dimension with the occlusion, motion, low illumination of the target object. This paper designed and implemented football detection system under multiple cameras for the detection and capture of targets in real-time matches. The main work mainly consists of three parts, football detector, single camera detection, and multi-cameras detection. The system used bundle adjustment to obtain the three-dimensional position of the target, and the GPU to accelerates data pre-processing and achieve accurate real-time capture of the target. By testing the system, it shows that the system can accurately detect and capture the moving targets in 3D. In addition, the solution in this paper is reusable for large-scale competitions, like basketball and soccer. The system framework can be well transplanted into other similar engineering project systems. It has been put into the market.	['Tianfang Zhang', 'Zhongfeng Kang', 'Wenhan Zhang']	94.0	arxiv		
14	FOOCTTS: Generating Arabic Speech with Acoustic Environment for Football Commentator	Massa Baali	2023-06-07 12:33:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07936v1	This paper presents FOOCTTS, an automatic pipeline for a football commentator that generates speech with background crowd noise. The application gets the text from the user, applies text pre-processing such as vowelization, followed by the commentator's speech synthesizer. Our pipeline included Arabic automatic speech recognition for data labeling, CTC segmentation, transcription vowelization to match speech, and fine-tuning the TTS. Our system is capable of generating speech with its acoustic environment within limited 15 minutes of football commentator recording. Our prototype is generalizable and can be easily applied to different domains and languages.	['Ahmed Ali']	24.0	arxiv

16	Seasonal Linear Predictivity in National Football Championships	Giuseppe Jurman	2015-11-19 17:14:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06262v1	Predicting the results of sport matches and competitions is an arising research field, benefiting from the growing amount of available data and the novel data analytics techniques. Excellent forecasts can be achieved by advanced machine learning methods applied to detailed historical data, especially in very popular sports such as football (soccer). Here we show that, despite the large number of confounding factors, the results of a football team in longer competitions (e.g., a national league) follow a basically linear trend useful for predictive purposes, too. In support of this claim, we present a set of experiments of linear regression on a database collecting the yearly results of 707 teams playing in 22 divisions from 11 countries, in 20 football seasons.

17	Do you think City is trying to do what Madrid did with Brazilian wonder-kids to Argentinians?	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-27 03:20:24	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18rqf8p/do_you_think_city_is_trying_to_do_what_madrid_did/	Real Madrid’s recent transfer policy centers around young Brazilians. Vinicius Junior in 2018, Rodrygo in 2019, Eder Militao in 2019. Renier Jesus in 2020. And Endrick in 2022. The get all of these players before they become established stars and some like Vini and Rodrygo before Europe even. And the seeds gave fruit. Vini is now the world’s best winger and only cost €45 million. Rodrygo is a prolific and performing right winger and only cost €40 million. Eder Militao is a top 5 world center back and only cost like €50 million. Renier Jesus flopped hard and Endrick is yet to prove himself, but these investments have shown to have lots of worth. They were big factors in guiding Madrid to another UCL. Brazil + Real Madrid is becoming a brand. Is Man City trying this with Argentines? They signed Alvarez last year and he’s been performing brilliantly for them, he’s very similar to Rodrygo. They signed Perrone who is developing and have now signed Everechhi a highly talented wonder kid from Boca. They are also thinking of signing Barco. Do you guys think Man City is trying to build a reputation in a Football hotbed like Argentina (like how Real Madrid did in Brazil?) after all Alvarez said that it was the positive history of Argentines in man city like aguero and Zabaletta that lead him to choose them. What do you guys think? Man City and Real Madrid are the 2 best clubs in the world right now, and seem to have the market for 2 of footballs’s greatest hotbeds in the continent of South America. Edit; sorry I made a typo: it’s Echeverri from River Plate, thx for correcting me			reddit	20.0	t3_18rqf8p

19	An Empirical Study on Google Research Football Multi-agent Scenarios	Yan Song	2023-05-16 14:18:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09458v1	Few multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) research on Google Research Football (GRF) focus on the 11v11 multi-agent full-game scenario and to the best of our knowledge, no open benchmark on this scenario has been released to the public. In this work, we fill the gap by providing a population-based MARL training pipeline and hyperparameter settings on multi-agent football scenario that outperforms the bot with difficulty 1.0 from scratch within 2 million steps. Our experiments serve as a reference for the expected performance of Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO), a state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm where each agent tries to maximize its own policy independently across various training configurations. Meanwhile, we open-source our training framework Light-MALib which extends the MALib codebase by distributed and asynchronized implementation with additional analytical tools for football games. Finally, we provide guidance for building strong football AI with population-based training and release diverse pretrained policies for benchmarking. The goal is to provide the community with a head start for whoever experiment their works on GRF and a simple-to-use population-based training framework for further improving their agents through self-play. The implementation is available at https://github.com/Shanghai-Digital-Brain-Laboratory/DB-Football.
