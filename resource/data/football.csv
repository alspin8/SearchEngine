1	Super League will happen anyway	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-21 16:01:55	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18nqbyg/super_league_will_happen_anyway/	Even if you have the most pessimist view of how it will kickstart it will still be watched , even if it starts off literally with only ( probably not ) Spanish and Italians teams. Think about it , even if its only Spanish and Italian clubs its still the best shot from among all other leagues in Europe at rivaling the English PL , people will tune in to see this new interesting thing happen , it will surely grab the curiosity of fans ( yes people say they will boycott but reality dictates that most of these people will watch anyway and there will be viewership which will bring big money. Once these clubs have enough money to rival the PL clubs every transfer market there will be a power shift because most of the Spanish and Italian clubs can offer players better ''quality of life'' perks like weather , night life and in most cases ( if its not Man Utd and Liverpool ) more historic platform football wise , not to mention that some of the best coaches and players in the top clubs in England are Spanish. Once that happens the PL , German and French clubs will magically realize they always wanted to be in the Super League. Is a question of how long it will take rather than if it happens. My personal opinion is that Super League and FIFA/UEFA should work together instead of damaging each other because everything points to the Super League becoming a reality. I was against a Super League idea when it was proposed as a closed league but im not going to lie i like the new proposed open competition , you get to see the biggest clubs play each other more often instead of watching top teams score 5 or 4 past lower clubs constantly , your club gets more money and the general spread of income is more spread around different nations and ''smaller'' clubs becoming richer. I can understand the English point of view , nobody wants to lose monopoly but if you want to be mature you have to admit that in the long run this will make a better spectacle than what is football today. You can argue that the Super League is not perfect, but what is ? The Super League is a better proposal than the new UEFA Champions League as a format and also financially if you objective and honest about this subject.	0	reddit	
2	The classification of football patterns	V. Braungart	2006-06-08 16:14:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606193v1	We prove that every spherical football (also known as a spherical soccer ball) is a branched cover, branched only in the vertices, of the standard football made up of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. We also give examples showing that the corresponding result is not true for footballs of higher genera. Moreover, we classify the possible pairs (k,l) for which football patterns on the sphere exist satisfying a natural generalisation of the usual incidence relation between pentagons and hexagons to k-gons and l-gons.		arxiv	['D.

6	Networks of international football: communities, evolution and globalization of the game	Yang Li	2022-05-21 13:43:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10599v1	As the most popular sport around the globe, the game of football has recently intrigued much research interest to explore and distill useful and appealing information from the sport. Network science and graph-centric methods have been previously applied to study the importance of football players and teams. In this paper, for the first time we study the macroscopic evolution of the football society from a complex network point of view. Football game records within a time window of over a century were collected and expressed in a graph format, where participant teams are represented by graph nodes and the games between them are the graph edges. We carry out community detection and temporal analysis to reveal the dynamic features and the community structures embedded within the football network, offering the evidence of a continuously expanding football society. Spatio-temporal analysis is also implemented to unveil the temporal states that represent distinct development stages in the football history. Our analysis suggests that the evolution of the game receives considerable impact not only from major sport events, but also from multiple social and political incidents. The game of football and its evolution reflect significant historical transitions and turning points, and can provide a novel perspective for the study of the worldwide globalization process.		arxiv	['Gonzalo Mateos']
7	Network analysis of the worldwide footballer transfer market	Ming-Xia Li	2018-11-01 10:16:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00300v1	The transfer of football players is an important part in football games. Most studies on the transfer of football players focus on the transfer system and transfer fees but not on the transfer behavior itself. Based on the 470,792 transfer records from 1990 to 2016 among 23,605 football clubs in 206 countries and regions, we construct a directed footballer transfer network (FTN), where the nodes are the football clubs and the links correspond to the footballer transfers. A systemic analysis is conduced on the topological properties of the FTN. We find that the in-degrees, out-degrees, in-strengths and out-strengths of nodes follow bimodal distributions (a power law with exponential decay), while the distribution of link weights has a power-law tail. We further figure out the correlations between node degrees, node strengths and link weights. We also investigate the general characteristics of different measures of network centrality. Our network analysis of the global footballer transfer market sheds new lights into the investigation of the characteristics of transfer activities.		arxiv	['Wei-Xing Zhou', 'H. Eugene Stanley']
8	Pricing Football Players using Neural Networks	Sourya Dey	2017-11-16 00:14:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05865v2	We designed a multilayer perceptron neural network to predict the price of a football (soccer) player using data on more than 15,000 players from the football simulation video game FIFA 2017. The network was optimized by experimenting with different activation functions, number of neurons and layers, learning rate and its decay, Nesterov momentum based stochastic gradient descent, L2 regularization, and early stopping. Simultaneous exploration of various aspects of neural network training is performed and their trade-offs are investigated. Our final model achieves a top-5 accuracy of 87.2% among 119 pricing categories, and places any footballer within 6.32% of his actual price on average.		arxiv	[]
9	Small angle limits of Hamilton's footballs	Yanir A. Rubinstein	2019-05-02 17:27:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00865v1	Compact Ricci solitons on surfaces have at most two cone points, and are known as Hamilton's footballs. In this note we completely describe the degenerations of these footballs as one or both of the cone angles approaches zero. In particular, we show that Hamilton's famous non-compact cigar soliton is the Gromov--Hausdorff limit of Hamilton's compact conical teardrop solitons.		arxiv	['Kewei Zhang']
10	The Socceral Force	Norbert Bátfai	2010-04-12 16:24:54	http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2003v2	We have an audacious dream, we would like to develop a simulation and virtual reality system to support the decision making in European football (soccer). In this review, we summarize the efforts that we have made to fulfil this dream until recently. In addition, an introductory version of FerSML (Footballer and Football Simulation Markup Language) is presented in this paper.		arxiv	[]

13	Predicting football tables by a maximally parsimonious model	Kjetil Haugen	2018-05-23 02:25:04	http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08937v1	This paper presents some useful mathematical results involved in football table prediction. In addition, some empirical results indicate that an alternative methodology for football table prediction may produce high quality forecasts with far less resource usage than conventional methods.		arxiv	['Brynjulf Owren']
14	Seasonal Linear Predictivity in National Football Championships	Giuseppe Jurman	2015-11-19 17:14:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06262v1	Predicting the results of sport matches and competitions is an arising research field, benefiting from the growing amount of available data and the novel data analytics techniques. Excellent forecasts can be achieved by advanced machine learning methods applied to detailed historical data, especially in very popular sports such as football (soccer). Here we show that, despite the large number of confounding factors, the results of a football team in longer competitions (e.g., a national league) follow a basically linear trend useful for predictive purposes, too. In support of this claim, we present a set of experiments of linear regression on a database collecting the yearly results of 707 teams playing in 22 divisions from 11 countries, in 20 football seasons.		arxiv	[]
15	Predictive modelling of football injuries	Stylianos Kampakis	2016-09-20 11:58:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07480v1	The goal of this thesis is to investigate the potential of predictive modelling for football injuries. This work was conducted in close collaboration with Tottenham Hotspurs FC (THFC), the PGA European tour and the participation of Wolverhampton Wanderers (WW). Three investigations were conducted: 1. Predicting the recovery time of football injuries using the UEFA injury recordings: The UEFA recordings is a common standard for recording injuries in professional football. For this investigation, three datasets of UEFA injury recordings were available. Different machine learning algorithms were used in order to build a predictive model. The performance of the machine learning models is then improved by using feature selection conducted through correlation-based subset feature selection and random forests. 2. Predicting injuries in professional football using exposure records: The relationship between exposure (in training hours and match hours) in professional football athletes and injury incidence was studied. A common problem in football is understanding how the training schedule of an athlete can affect the chance of him getting injured. The task was to predict the number of days a player can train before he gets injured. 3. Predicting intrinsic injury incidence using in-training GPS measurements: A significant percentage of football injuries can be attributed to overtraining and fatigue. GPS data collected during training sessions might provide indicators of fatigue, or might be used to detect very intense training sessions which can lead to overtraining. This research used GPS data gathered during training sessions of the first team of THFC, in order to predict whether an injury would take place during a week.		arxiv	[]

19	Explaining the difference between men's and women's football	Luca Pappalardo	2021-01-05 17:25:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01662v1	Women's football is gaining supporters and practitioners worldwide, raising questions about what the differences are with men's football. While the two sports are often compared based on the players' physical attributes, we analyze the spatio-temporal events during matches in the last World Cups to compare male and female teams based on their technical performance. We train an artificial intelligence model to recognize if a team is male or female based on variables that describe a match's playing intensity, accuracy, and performance quality. Our model accurately distinguishes between men's and women's football, revealing crucial technical differences, which we investigate through the extraction of explanations from the classifier's decisions. The differences between men's and women's football are rooted in play accuracy, the recovery time of ball possession, and the players' performance quality. Our methodology may help journalists and fans understand what makes women's football a distinct sport and coaches design tactics tailored to female teams.		arxiv	['Alessio Rossi', 'Giuseppe Pontillo', 'Michela Natilli', 'Paolo Cintia']
