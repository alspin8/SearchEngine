0	Football is becoming more predictable; Network analysis of 88 thousands matches in 11 major leagues	Victor Martins Maimone	2019-08-23 19:25:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08991v2	In recent years excessive monetization of football and professionalism among the players has been argued to have affected the quality of the match in different ways. On the one hand, playing football has become a high-income profession and the players are highly motivated; on the other hand, stronger teams have higher incomes and therefore afford better players leading to an even stronger appearance in tournaments that can make the game more imbalanced and hence predictable. To quantify and document this observation, in this work we take a minimalist network science approach to measure the predictability of football over 26 years in major European leagues. We show that over time, the games in major leagues have indeed become more predictable. We provide further support for this observation by showing that inequality between teams has increased and the home-field advantage has been vanishing ubiquitously. We do not include any direct analysis on the effects of monetization on football's predictability or therefore, lack of excitement, however, we propose several hypotheses which could be tested in future analyses.

1	Do people actually underrate Inter players?	:SerieA:Serie A	2024-01-03 12:47:29	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18ximg5/do_people_actually_underrate_inter_players/	For example: When people talk about the best signings of the summer window. I hear names like Kane, Bellingham and Rice etc. But no one mentioned the free signing Thuram, who has 13 G/A overall. Or last year when Osimhen was hitting his best form and became the Top Scorer of Serie A, people are comparing him to Haaland. But this season when Lautaro scored 15 Goals in 16 Games. People just ignore it. So my question is do people underrate Inter Players, when yes, why?			reddit	36.0	t3_18ximg5

3	A Reinforcement Learning Based Approach to Play Calling in Football	Preston Biro	2021-03-11 20:23:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06939v1	With the vast amount of data collected on football and the growth of computing abilities, many games involving decision choices can be optimized. The underlying rule is the maximization of an expected utility of outcomes and the law of large numbers. The data available allows us to compute with high accuracy the probabilities of outcomes of decisions and the well defined points system in the game allows us to have the necessary terminal utilities. With some well established theory we can then optimize choices at a single play level.	['Stephen G. Walker']	73.0	arxiv

We introduce the Google Research Football Environment, a new reinforcement learning environment where agents are trained to play football in an advanced, physics-based 3D simulator. The resulting environment is challenging, easy to use and customize, and it is available under a permissive open-source license. In addition, it provides support for multiplayer and multi-agent experiments. We propose three full-game scenarios of varying difficulty with the Football Benchmarks and report baseline results for three commonly used reinforcement algorithms (IMPALA, PPO, and Ape-X DQN). We also provide a diverse set of simpler scenarios with the Football Academy and showcase several promising research directions.

10	Here's why I think Kylian Mbappe should move to Liverpool and its the only correct move for competitive balance in world football.	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-06 08:32:26	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18zvhji/heres_why_i_think_kylian_mbappe_should_move_to/	Here's why I think Mbappe should move to Liverpool and its the only correct move for competitive balance in world football: 1. Bayern will never sanction a move for him, and I don't think Mbappe wants to go from one horse league to another. 2. Barca are broke, Atletico are not prestigious enough. 3. Serie A clubs like Juve, Inter, Milan also do not posses the financial muscle to afford him. 4. That leaves the PL clubs, among which United/Chelsea are too shit for him to consider, City has his rival Haaland playing, Arsenal has FFP issues, Spurs/Newcastle are not gonna entice him and that leaves only Liverpool! So its either moving to Madrid, staying at PSG or coming to Liverpool: 1. Scenario - stays at PSG: He's reaching the ceiling of his potential to grow in Ligue 1 away from worldwide attention and he needs to move in order to evolve as well as start increasing his legacy as a player if he truly wants to contend for one of the greatest players of all-time. 2. Scenario - comes to Liverpool: He will play in the most popular league in the world, with his rival Haaland against him for another title winning side of Man City, its the perfect blockbuster. --- Now comes the nightmare final scenario - Goes to Real Madrid: This is the last straw that will break things apart. If he goes there, then there is no side stopping Madrid to completely decimate the Europe for a decade to come. Real Madrid will have these players under their disposal if things go according to plan: - Mbappe (25) - Vini (23) - Rodrygo (23) - Endrick (17) - Bellingham (20) - Guler (18) - Valverde (25) - Tchouameni (23) - Camavinga (20) - Militao (25) - Davies (23) ? - Yoro (18) ? How is anyone in their wildest dream can compete against this monster team that will all come in their prime together while gelling on chemistry for decade to come? It will ruin the Champions League forever to Mercedes F1 levels. Mbappe, has to come to Liverpool.			reddit	30.0	t3_18zvhji
11	Distinguishing Between Roles of Football Players in Play-by-play Match Event Data	Bart Aalbers	2018-09-13 20:43:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05173v1	Over the last few decades, the player recruitment process in professional football has evolved into a multi-billion industry and has thus become of vital importance. To gain insights into the general level of their candidate reinforcements, many professional football clubs have access to extensive video footage and advanced statistics. However, the question whether a given player would fit the team's playing style often still remains unanswered. In this paper, we aim to bridge that gap by proposing a set of 21 player roles and introducing a method for automatically identifying the most applicable roles for each player from play-by-play event data collected during matches.

13	Design and Implementation of A Soccer Ball Detection System with Multiple Cameras	Lei Li	2023-01-31 22:04:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00123v1	The detection of small and medium-sized objects in three dimensions has always been a frontier exploration problem. This technology has a very wide application in sports analysis, games, virtual reality, human animation and other fields. The traditional three-dimensional small target detection technology has the disadvantages of high cost, low precision and inconvenience, so it is difficult to apply in practice. With the development of machine learning and deep learning, the technology of computer vision algorithms is becoming more mature. Creating an immersive media experience is considered to be a very important research work in sports. The main work is to explore and solve the problem of football detection under the multiple cameras, aiming at the research and implementation of the live broadcast system of football matches. Using multi cameras detects a target ball and determines its position in three dimension with the occlusion, motion, low illumination of the target object. This paper designed and implemented football detection system under multiple cameras for the detection and capture of targets in real-time matches. The main work mainly consists of three parts, football detector, single camera detection, and multi-cameras detection. The system used bundle adjustment to obtain the three-dimensional position of the target, and the GPU to accelerates data pre-processing and achieve accurate real-time capture of the target. By testing the system, it shows that the system can accurately detect and capture the moving targets in 3D. In addition, the solution in this paper is reusable for large-scale competitions, like basketball and soccer. The system framework can be well transplanted into other similar engineering project systems. It has been put into the market.	['Tianfang Zhang', 'Zhongfeng Kang', 'Wenhan Zhang']	94.0	arxiv

16	Seasonal Linear Predictivity in National Football Championships	Giuseppe Jurman	2015-11-19 17:14:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06262v1	Predicting the results of sport matches and competitions is an arising research field, benefiting from the growing amount of available data and the novel data analytics techniques. Excellent forecasts can be achieved by advanced machine learning methods applied to detailed historical data, especially in very popular sports such as football (soccer). Here we show that, despite the large number of confounding factors, the results of a football team in longer competitions (e.g., a national league) follow a basically linear trend useful for predictive purposes, too. In support of this claim, we present a set of experiments of linear regression on a database collecting the yearly results of 707 teams playing in 22 divisions from 11 countries, in 20 football seasons.

17	Do you think City is trying to do what Madrid did with Brazilian wonder-kids to Argentinians?	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-27 03:20:24	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18rqf8p/do_you_think_city_is_trying_to_do_what_madrid_did/	Real Madrid’s recent transfer policy centers around young Brazilians. Vinicius Junior in 2018, Rodrygo in 2019, Eder Militao in 2019. Renier Jesus in 2020. And Endrick in 2022. The get all of these players before they become established stars and some like Vini and Rodrygo before Europe even. And the seeds gave fruit. Vini is now the world’s best winger and only cost €45 million. Rodrygo is a prolific and performing right winger and only cost €40 million. Eder Militao is a top 5 world center back and only cost like €50 million. Renier Jesus flopped hard and Endrick is yet to prove himself, but these investments have shown to have lots of worth. They were big factors in guiding Madrid to another UCL. Brazil + Real Madrid is becoming a brand. Is Man City trying this with Argentines? They signed Alvarez last year and he’s been performing brilliantly for them, he’s very similar to Rodrygo. They signed Perrone who is developing and have now signed Everechhi a highly talented wonder kid from Boca. They are also thinking of signing Barco. Do you guys think Man City is trying to build a reputation in a Football hotbed like Argentina (like how Real Madrid did in Brazil?) after all Alvarez said that it was the positive history of Argentines in man city like aguero and Zabaletta that lead him to choose them. What do you guys think? Man City and Real Madrid are the 2 best clubs in the world right now, and seem to have the market for 2 of footballs’s greatest hotbeds in the continent of South America.

In this work, we fill the gap by providing a population-based MARL training pipeline and hyperparameter settings on multi-agent football scenario that outperforms the bot with difficulty 1.0 from scratch within 2 million steps. Our experiments serve as a reference for the expected performance of Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO), a state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm where each agent tries to maximize its own policy independently across various training configurations. Meanwhile, we open-source our training framework Light-MALib which extends the MALib codebase by distributed and asynchronized implementation with additional analytical tools for football games. Finally, we provide guidance for building strong football AI with population-based training and release diverse pretrained policies for benchmarking. The goal is to provide the community with a head start for whoever experiment their works on GRF and a simple-to-use population-based training framework for further improving their agents through self-play. The implementation is available at https://github.com/Shanghai-Digital-Brain-Laboratory/DB-Football.

38	Willian had the skillset, athleticism and work ethic to be a superstar but his decision making and game intelligence let him down so much.	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-04 04:09:30	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18y3uhg/willian_had_the_skillset_athleticism_and_work/	His talent work ethic and physical attributes are a major reason why he's still decent in the premier league at am advanced age. He was rapid, could stop and start on a dime, accelerated from a stop almost faster than anyone else I've seen, press resistant, great ball striking, good range of passing, high work rate but unfortunately he was just horrible at decision making and had mediocre in game intelligence. In his prime at chelsea he constantly constantly messed up counter attacks, had a very poor sense of positioning and making off ball runs, and despite being good at ball striking and having a great passing range lacked the vision to be a consistent creative outlet. This is one of the reasons why fans of other teams think he used to be great and chelsea fans used to not like him as much. He was genuinely skilled and super talented, just not the smartest guy on the pitch.			reddit	7.0	t3_18y3uhg

Saudi Arabia doesn’t want anyone with Atatürk (Founder of Turkey) banner and etc. They also say that İstiklal Marşı (National Anthem) will not sung before match. Both teams are in their hotels right now. (There is one hour until the match starts.) Galatasaray said that they wont be starting match before training with Atatürk t-shirts. Most possible thing that can happen for this match is canceling it right now This is a scandal. UPDATE: Match is cancelled. UPDATE 2: Saudi Arabia rejected Galatasarays private planes departure. They say that the air traffic is too busy now. They also keep Fenerbahçe in country. UPDATE 3: TFF President Mehmet Büyükekşi pass out at hotel. Officials called an ambulance for him. It looks like he understood that he has to resignate.			reddit	35.0	t3_18trhdb

67	Eric Dier - what next for him?	Unknown	2023-12-29 16:06:37	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18tqirh/eric_dier_what_next_for_him/	As the title suggests. I wondered where people thought he may go next really. Thinking about what he offers - pretty much can only play in the centre of a three or possibly defensive midfield, which maybe means Italy or lower half prem teams, but none really play a back 3 in the prem atm. In terms of what he offers, you get a player with great leadership, really nice distribution short or long. Aerial ability perfectly decent but not a strong one on one tackler. On the downside I'm not sure how press resistant he is, he's slow which will be an issue to any team attempting a high line, and if he were to be moved into midfield it's a long time since he's played there so very much an unproven quantity. Can he do the stones style role of playing in a 4 and tucking in as part of a double pivot in possession? I'm not sure what his potential is picking up the ball on the half turn, and equally not sure he can still be a decent 6. I'm interested to know people's thoughts. I think he's got a lot of talent but maybe not specific traits that suit the modern game? The only top side in the prem playing a low block counter attack style that would suit him are united, and that would be a hugely long shot move. I'd be intrigued to know if he could play as a single pivot in a 433 but it's a long shot. What does everyone think?			reddit	1.0	t3_18tqirh

My question is, do you think that there are any real differentiators to these groups? Is there any of them that actually justifies their existence by having something in their methodology that is doing things differently?

76	Why don't we have a ratio of individual goals scored/team goals scored	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-27 12:43:28	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18rzvgu/why_dont_we_have_a_ratio_of_individual_goals/	"When we have discussion about players we always have raw stats (total of goals, assists and at best goals/assists per game, but i think it will be better to have goals/assists per minutes played) but we never have a ratio vs team goals scored. Some players really benefits from their teams style of play (Haaland for Man City for instance) but others don't (Hazard during his Chelsea time with a very defensive side). With expected goals/assists it kind of balance this problem but does not account for other factors. Example, if you play with Salah at Liverpool you know you will have more space because defenders will focus on him, even if they are far, they will keep an eye on him. Another exemple, if you play with very aggressive and technical players, you will have more penalties given to you and it increases your goals scored amount. So a bit of a controversial take to finish but if we take Messi and Ronaldo, I think that they had massively benefit, in terms of stats, from their superteam goal scoring machine but we never take that into account. Messi for Argentina : 0,58 goals per game VS Messi for Barcelona : 0,86 goals Ronaldo for Portugal : 0,62 goals per game Vs Ronaldo for Real Madrid : 1,03 goals per game Vs Ronaldo for Juventus : 0,75 goals per game Hazard for Chelsea : 0,31 goal per game (but to be fair he has also 0,26 assists per game) Torres for a defensive Liverpool Benitez side : 0,57 goals per game (just needed another exemple) We can see that it makes a huge difference, if we can have a ratio it will balance things out and helps us make better comparaison, some players stats are really helped by their teams offensive tactic, the players they play with, where they play (it is easier to score in Bundesliga), etc. I hope one day that we will have more context on stats in football, it really feels ""cheap"" and ""childish"" sometimes."			reddit	3.0	t3_18rzvgu

Vinicius Junior in 2018, Rodrygo in 2019, Eder Militao in 2019. Renier Jesus in 2020. And Endrick in 2022. The get all of these players before they become established stars and some like Vini and Rodrygo before Europe even. And the seeds gave fruit. Vini is now the world’s best winger and only cost €45 million. Rodrygo is a prolific and performing right winger and only cost €40 million. Eder Militao is a top 5 world center back and only cost like €50 million. Renier Jesus flopped hard and Endrick is yet to prove himself, but these investments have shown to have lots of worth. They were big factors in guiding Madrid to another UCL. Brazil + Real Madrid is becoming a brand. Is Man City trying this with Argentines? They signed Alvarez last year and he’s been performing brilliantly for them, he’s very similar to Rodrygo. They signed Perrone who is developing and have now signed Everechhi a highly talented wonder kid from Boca. They are also thinking of signing Barco. Do you guys think Man City is trying to build a reputation in a Football hotbed like Argentina (like how Real Madrid did in Brazil?) after all Alvarez said that it was the positive history of Argentines in man city like aguero and Zabaletta that lead him to choose them. What do you guys think? Man City and Real Madrid are the 2 best clubs in the world right now, and seem to have the market for 2 of footballs’s greatest hotbeds in the continent of South America.

Juventus, Milan, Barcelona, Man United, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Liverpool, for god's sake even Paris Saint Germain, all of them have been falling and falling, losing players, appeal, tradition, fans. The Messi and Ronaldo's era was quite long, and probably destroyed many other players in the meanwhile, but they were part of a larger design, they played against and with the likes of Nesta, Maldini, Scholes, Keane, Giggs, Ronaldinho, Cannavaro, Del Piero, Totti, Buffon and so on, leaving a permanent mark. The class of 90s has been quite disappointing and no one has really replaced the old legends, leaving a generational void. The super league, the downward spiral of certain domestic championships, the diminishing importance of the Champions League and the increase of black swans events like multiple balloon d'ors winners, repeted consecutive champions league winners, legends leaving their historical clubs or joining rivals or playing in Arabia for money, no players actually caring about glory, alongside the disillusion and diminishing cultural importance of the sport (younger generations care more about Fortnite thsn football) and the lack of personality by football figures have destroyed the beauty of this game.

81	Rodri is not as good as people claim he is	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-28 10:36:48	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18sqzu3/rodri_is_not_as_good_as_people_claim_he_is/	Before y'all down vote and comment to tell me I'm the dumbest mfer alive, hear me out. Rodri is undeniably a world class player. His ability to retain the ball is amazing. He can cope with being left all alone in midfield... Against weaker teams. Which is impressive, don't get me wrong. You can't expect a midfielder to hold the entire midfield of a top team alone. But here is my first problem with what people claim of Rodri. People pretend that Rodri single handedly bosses the midfield against top teams. And sure, he might have 1 game once in a while where he does that. Great players have great moments. But that does *not* mean he is capable of regularly doing that. In my opinion, no one is capable of regularly bossing a midfield around by themselves. Yet, mostly city fans to be fair, have been claiming this for a while and I'm getting quite tired of seeing it. No, Rodri vs the entire Arsenal midfield isn't going to win. He's not THAT good. My second complaint about what people say about Rodri is that he's better than Haaland or De Bruyne because City can win without either of them, but not without Rodri. And I'm sorry, but that's a non sequitur argument. A non sequitur argument is an argument where the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. Rodri being more important to that City team is the logical conclusion. Now you can argue that him being more important makes him better, but that I would disagree with also. I think Rodri is more important because of Pep's system requiring a DM, but they only have Rodri. Let me elaborate on that before you try to call me stupid though. Who do Manchester City have when Grealish is out? Doku and Foden. Who do City have when Haaland is out? Alvarez, potentially the third best striker in the world. Who do they have when Bernardo Silva is out? Again, Foden can play that position. Who do City have when Nunes or Kovacic are out? They have Rico Lewis. Who do Manchester City have to control the attack? When he's not injured, De Bruyne. Arguably the best creative midfielder in the world right now. Now don't get me wrong, not all players I have named are worldclass. But you would all agree with me if I said they are good enough at what they do to fall in, right? But who do City have as back up for Rodri? Philips... Kelvin Philips. So I really, truly, must beg the question whether Rodri is as important to City as he is because he's on level with Lothar Matthaus (I've seen some idiot actually claim this) or if it's because City have no back up DM. In my opinion, it's the latter. Again, Rodri is worldclass, but he's NOT the best player in the world. And no, him being more important for City than Haaland, when City have the third best striker in the world coming off the bench, is not a great argument for why he's *better*.			reddit	37.0	t3_18sqzu3
82	Why does football not allow more contact	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-28 01:08:28	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18sgx27/why_does_football_not_allow_more_contact/	Hey I never liked football as a kid due to football culture and have always much preferred rugby which I played through my childhood but recently I've been enjoying watching football but I can not get over the fact that if players make slight contact they will both dive to the floor. I understand that tripping and holding someone would ruin the ball play but shouldering and pushing someone I feel would not hinder the sport and that if u fall to the ground when u could of stayed up should be severely punished. There are many sports that play like football but have more contact like ice hockey which is played the same with and without contact so I feel like greater contact would not hurt football. Is this a common line of thought with football fans or am to used to the contact of rugby			reddit	15.0	t3_18sgx27

89	The death of team spirit? Your opinions	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-26 13:18:44	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18r7ypp/the_death_of_team_spirit_your_opinions/	Been closely following some of the recent matches, so there's quite a lot to unpack. &#x200B; Firstly, Liverpool vs. MC. Quite the spectacle, but I couldn't help feeling frustrated with Liverpool's performance. Defense was shaky at best, and Van Dijk seemed off his game (not the first time this season). Felt like watching a replay of some of their earlier matches. Remember the stats from ESPN showing a 12% decrease in their defensive efficiency compared to last season? &#x200B; Moving on to Real Madrid, their performance against Barça was an impressive showcase of tactical prowess, but there seemed to be a lack of consistent energy. Yes, Benzema scored a stunning goal, but overall, something felt missing. According to Marca, Barcelona’s ball possession has decreased by 8% this season. Speaking of broadcasts, I had a hard time catching the games during my stay in Mexico. If I hadn’t perused the tips at [https://onlinetvcast.com/guides/how-to-watch-espn-in-mexico-easily-in-2023-tested-solution](https://onlinetvcast.com/guides/how-to-watch-espn-in-mexico-easily-in-2023-tested-solution), I would’ve been left on a 2-week ESPN diet, which is not something I’m accustomed to. No bueno, ESPN. &#x200B; Back to the matches, I also have to mention Chelsea. In short, they’re in need of a revamp. The recent 2-2 draw against a team they should’ve steamrolled through is a testament to that. The Athletic recently pointed out their lack of strategic depth, and I can’t disagree. &#x200B; On a more positive note, Bayern Munich continues their impressive streak, e.g., their recent 5-0 win. Lewandowski’s absence was hardly felt, all due respect. IIRC Bundesliga's stats, the team’s goal conversion rate has increased by 15%. &#x200B; Last but not least is PSG. They seem to be on a winning trajectory now, but I find their current lack of teamwork to be a glaring pitfall. Right now, the team feels more like a group of stars than a cohesive unit. Neymar and Mbappe’s aren’t gelling as well as what we saw last season. &#x200B; All in all, I see the season as a rollercoaster with more downs than ups. Do you think it’s a matter of losing team spirit for the sake of individual brilliance or a season-long phase?			reddit	6.0	t3_18r7ypp

91	Why is Central America so bad at football	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-24 18:49:53	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18q18ne/why_is_central_america_so_bad_at_football/	Latin America is usually considered to be the most talented and football-obsessed region in the world, and while most of the attention is usually on South America, many people associate Central America with them. However, South America has many world cups, and is competitive on a national and league level. However, in CONCACAF Central America has 0 gold cups. Jamaica's been to 2 Gold cup Finals, winning none which is about the same as Central American nations. However, in the Caribbean, there are more popular sports such as Cricket and Athletics, in Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic Baseball is bigger. Mexico and USA dominate the Gold Cup and while Mexico is understandable, Football is only the 4th or 5th most popular sport in the USA, even Canada has 1 Gold Cup and hockey is the biggest sport there. On a Club level, they do not fare much better, with Mexico and USA dominating and Caribbean countries having a similar level of success as Central America except Costa Rica, which falls behind the USA and Mexico. I really do not understand why this happens, every reason I can think of also applies to many South American and other countries. for example, one could say Central American countries are poor and corrupt, but this is also the case in South America where football is arguably played at the highest average level &#x200B; The small population size can be blamed as Central America can be dwarfed in comparison to USA, Mexico and even Canada. However, this does not stop South America where the 2 largest countries are Brazil (by miles) and Argentina. However, Uruguay with about 2% of Brazils population has more Copa Americas and won the World Cup twice (was world champions 4 times). Furthermore, in the Copa America and club level all countries in South America are relatively competitive in CONMEBOL despite the population disparity, as all except for one have won the Copa America. Also as stated before, Caribbean countries have a similar population, on average less actually and this small population competes for bigger sports (in my country cricket). but play at a similar level to Central American nations in CONCACAF. To an extent, this population disparity exists in every region, but aside from Oceania when Australia was still in it, none are dominated by one country &#x200B; Maybe its because the domestic leagues are poor in comparison to South America and Europe, this may be true, as I heard in Central America professional leagues are not very developed, but they are much more developed compared to the Caribbean, in many of these countries teams don't have proper stadiums or even broadcasting, but still have similar levels of success in the CONCACAF champions league compared to Central America, except for Costa Rica as stated before. So while a lack of good leagues to develop players is a factor, it is a problem that is worse in other CONCACAF countries &#x200B; so please help me understand, why is Central America so bad at football despite being a nation where football is popular. in a region which is usually talented. By the way, no hate is intended, I still believe Central America is slightly better on average than the Caribbean but the reason I am making this is because I used to think Central America was on Par with Mexico and South American nations, but that is not the case.			reddit	63.0	t3_18q18ne

I feel as if puttimg him in a position where there isn't so much pressure on him to shoot rather than to make play could very well make his performance skyrocket. Looking back at a Joelinton heatmap circa 2019, we could see some form of echo between his performance and Højlund. Seeing as Højlund tends to make fast runs at the ball into the box and taking advantages of loose balls, considering a more playmaking CAM position could be a good call for ten Hag's Man United, which can take advantage of his spearing runs as well as his offensive awareness while easing some of the pressure for him to shoot and giving him more of an incentive to pass. This is just an opinion of mine, so please tell me what you think.			reddit	1.0	t3_18qfpp1

MetLife is accessible via public transport. Probably the best option, but it could have a weather issue due to it not having climate control in case of an emergency. Also time zones could mess with Europe, plus it isn’t central. Edit: nyc is no longer world’s capital Los Angeles, America’s 2nd biggest metro area and also very prevalent. Great football scene. SoFi is amazing, but isn’t mainly for soccer and that issue is still there. Probably would the be nearly the best venue but time zones once again could mess with TV viewership in optimizing this game for Europe means kick off will need to be at peak daytime which would be awful for the players. Dallas: least prevalent city of the 3, but has the biggest stadium in terms of capacity. Also is central, has climate control in the stadium to avoid all weather issues, and has time zones which work to make it so the game’s optimized for Europe but also is at afternoon for kick off so the players can have good conditions.

Often Nottingham Forest games (don't talk to me about today) as my brother works there, but I've also been to many London clubs since moving to uni (Chelsea, Charlton, Millwall) as well as some random matches here and there (Blackburn, Stoke). There's nothing I love more than the matchday experience. The emanance of anticipation in the town centre, adhering to a trail of eager fans marching in droves to the stadium. The congregation in the pub catching the end of the half 12 kick, refreshing the socials to get team news. The pre-match music, walkouts, chanting, and everything that follows. Being from the North, I naturally also have a huge soft spot for any stadium that does chips and gravy. I'm a simple man. Sitting down at half time with chips and gravy observing the details of the stadium against a rusted and weathered seat, the scarf and food warming me up from the bitter 4pm Winter cold. I love it all. However, I don't drive. Though I live in London for uni, that'll get me a lot of opportunities to go to many clubs, and there's also good transport links from the city which'll make any stadium South of Birmingham relatively easy to access. However, trains are so very expensive, even with a railcard, and tickets can also be over £25 even for League Two clubs nowadays, let alone the hundred or so pounds you're paying for Prem clubs through third parties. Does anyone have any tips on accessing cheap tickets, especially for Premier League clubs? And also any tips for travelling around the country on matchday etc. Thank you.			reddit	4.0	t3_18pjmpe

This is usually down to being a one club city and having a 52k stadium. Hertha Berlin play in a 70k seater and are based in the capital of the biggest economy in Europe.

110	Impact of velocity and impact angle on football shot accuracy during fundamental trainings	Rahman Sahinler	2023-02-07 12:24:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03426v1	The purpose of this research is to create a machine learning-based smart coaching approach for football that can replace manual analysis with real-time feedback for trainers. In-depth analysis of football player data by humans is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires a lot of effort. This exploratory study demonstrates the feasibility of using a machine learning algorithm to enhance the effectiveness of player monitoring and training. The suggested approach uses machine learning to generate analytical insights and enable long-term monitoring of player performance. In the future, machine learning could use this technique to offer constructive criticism of football players. The system incorporates a homemade ball-throwing mechanism capable of launching the ball in a variety of directions and at varying velocities. The ball kicker is equipped with a gyroscope and accelerometer sensors for measuring velocity and acceleration. The gathered data is filtered initially, and then the data that has been processed is fed into the machine-learning algorithm. The algorithm will be trained on player performance data and will be able to provide real-time feedback to coaches on player performance and potential areas for improvement. Additionally, the system will be able to track player progress over time and provide coaches with a comprehensive view of player development. The ultimate goal is to improve player performance and reduce the workload for coaches by automating the analysis process.

111	Deep Generative Multi-Agent Imitation Model as a Computational Benchmark for Evaluating Human Performance in Complex Interactive Tasks: A Case Study in Football	Chaoyi Gu	2023-03-23 15:01:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13323v1	Evaluating the performance of human is a common need across many applications, such as in engineering and sports. When evaluating human performance in completing complex and interactive tasks, the most common way is to use a metric having been proved efficient for that context, or to use subjective measurement techniques. However, this can be an error prone and unreliable process since static metrics cannot capture all the complex contexts associated with such tasks and biases exist in subjective measurement. The objective of our research is to create data-driven AI agents as computational benchmarks to evaluate human performance in solving difficult tasks involving multiple humans and contextual factors. We demonstrate this within the context of football performance analysis. We train a generative model based on Conditional Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) Model on a large player and ball tracking dataset. The trained model is used to imitate the interactions between two teams and predict the performance from each team. Then the trained Conditional VRNN Model is used as a benchmark to evaluate team performance. The experimental results on Premier League football dataset demonstrates the usefulness of our method to existing state-of-the-art static metric used in football analytics.

112	Here Comes the STRAIN: Analyzing Defensive Pass Rush in American Football with Player Tracking Data	Quang Nguyen	2023-05-17 14:52:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10262v3	In American football, a pass rush is an attempt by the defensive team to disrupt the offense and prevent the quarterback (QB) from completing a pass. Existing metrics for assessing pass rush performance are either discrete-time quantities or based on subjective judgment. Using player tracking data, we propose STRAIN, a novel metric for evaluating pass rushers in the National Football League (NFL) at the continuous-time within-play level. Inspired by the concept of strain rate in materials science, STRAIN is a simple and interpretable means for measuring defensive pressure in football. It is a directly-observed statistic as a function of two features: the distance between the pass rusher and QB, and the rate at which this distance is being reduced. Our metric possesses great predictability of pressure and stability over time. We also fit a multilevel model for STRAIN to understand the defensive pressure contribution of every pass rusher at the play-level. We apply our approach to NFL data and present results for the first eight weeks of the 2021 regular season. In particular, we provide comparisons of STRAIN for different defensive positions and play outcomes, and rankings of the NFL's best pass rushers according to our metric.	['Ronald Yurko', 'Gregory J.

113	A network-based ranking system for American college football	Juyong Park	2005-05-24 17:07:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505169v4	American college football faces a conflict created by the desire to stage national championship games between the best teams of a season when there is no conventional playoff system to decide which those teams are. Instead, ranking of teams is based on their record of wins and losses during the season, but each team plays only a small fraction of eligible opponents, making the system underdetermined or contradictory or both. It is an interesting challenge to create a ranking system that at once is mathematically well-founded, gives results in general accord with received wisdom concerning the relative strengths of the teams, and is based upon intuitive principles, allowing it to be accepted readily by fans and experts alike. Here we introduce a one-parameter ranking method that satisfies all of these requirements and is based on a network representation of college football schedules.	['M. E. J. Newman']	98.0	arxiv

It turns out that in particular the tails of the distributions are not well described by independent Bernoulli trials, but rather well modeled by negative binomial or generalized extreme value distributions. To understand this behavior from first principles, we suggest to modify the Bernoulli random process to include a simple component of self-affirmation which seems to describe the data surprisingly well and allows to interpret the observed deviation from Gaussian statistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood as special cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score data from many leagues in Europe as well as from international tournaments and found the proposed models to be applicable rather universally. In particular, here we compare men's and women's leagues and the separate German leagues during the cold war times and find some remarkable differences.

115	Toward reducing impact induced brain injury: Lessons from a computational study of army and football helmet pads	W. C. Moss	2012-04-12 15:18:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2753v1	We use computational simulations to compare the impact response of different football and U.S. Army helmet pad materials. We conduct experiments to characterize the material response of different helmet pads. We simulate experimental helmet impact tests performed by the U.S. Army to validate our methods. We then simulate a cylindrical impactor striking different pads. The acceleration history of the impactor is used to calculate the Head Injury Criterion for each pad. We conduct sensitivity studies exploring the effects of pad composition, geometry, and material stiffness. We find that: (1) The football pad materials do not outperform the currently used military pad material in militarily-relevant impact scenarios; (2) Optimal material properties for a pad depend on impact energy; and (3) Thicker pads perform better at all velocities. Our analysis suggests that by using larger helmet shells with correspondingly thicker pads, impact-induced traumatic brain injury may be significantly reduced.

The algorithm starts with an initial population including three different groups of teams: the wealthiest (strongest), the regular, the poorest (weakest). Each individual of population constitute a football team while each player is an indication of a player in a post. The optimization can hopefully occurs when the competition among the teams in all the leagues is imitated as the strongest teams usually purchase the best players of the regular teams and in turn, regular teams purchase the best players of the weakest who should always discover young players instead of buying professionals. It has been shown that the algorithm can hopefully converge to an acceptable solution solving various benchmarks. Key words: Heuristic Algorithms	[]	101.0	arxiv

In this paper we analyse the available data on football world championships since 1930 until today. Our goal is to rank the national teams based on all matches during the championships. For this purpose, we apply the PageRank with restarts algorithm to a graph built from the games played during the tournaments. Several statistics such as matches won and goals scored are combined in different metrics that assign weights to the links in the graph. Finally, our results indicate that the Random walk approach with the use of right metrics can indeed produce relevant rankings comparable to the FIFA official all-time ranking board.

118	MORE: Merged Opinions Reputation Model	Nardine Osman	2015-03-31 14:39:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.09066v1	Reputation is generally defined as the opinion of a group on an aspect of a thing. This paper presents a reputation model that follows a probabilistic modelling of opinions based on three main concepts: (1) the value of an opinion decays with time, (2) the reputation of the opinion source impacts the reliability of the opinion, and (3) the certainty of the opinion impacts its weight with respect to other opinions. Furthermore, the model is flexible with its opinion sources: it may use explicit opinions or implicit opinions that can be extracted from agent behavior in domains where explicit opinions are sparse. We illustrate the latter with an approach to extract opinions from behavioral information in the sports domain, focusing on football in particular. One of the uses of a reputation model is predicting behavior. We take up the challenge of predicting the behavior of football teams in football matches, which we argue is a very interesting yet difficult approach for evaluating the model.

However, most of the duration of a football game is spent away from the boxes, passing the ball around. The way teams pass the ball around is the most characteristic measurement of what a team's ""unique style"" is. In the present work we analyse passing sequences at the player level, using the different passing frequencies as a ""digital fingerprint"" of a player's style. The resulting numbers provide an adequate feature set which can be used in order to construct a measure of similarity between players. Armed with such a similarity tool, one can try to answer the question: Who might possibly replace Xavi at FC Barcelona?"	['Raúl Sánchez Navarro']	104.0	arxiv		
120	Competitive balance measures and the Uncertainty of Outcome Hypothesis in European football	Vasileios Manasis	2015-07-02 15:44:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00634v2	Competitive balance is an important concept for professional sports and one of the key issues that European football has to address in order to ensure its long-term prosperity. However, the quantification of competitive balance is not an easy task. The difficulties are mainly associated with its multi-dimensionality character as well as the structure of each particular sport. This article uses data from eight domestic leagues over 60 years to identify the best index for a holistic view of competitive balance in European football. The findings support the longstanding Uncertainty of Outcome Hypothesis using indices designed for the important three identified levels of competition and offering a weighting pattern for ranking places. Important conclusions may be derived concerning the relative importance of different aspects of competitive balance depending on the specific features of the best index.

The proposed method is fully automatic in contrast to the current state of the art which requires manual initialization of point correspondences between the image and the static model. Automatic registration using existing approaches has been difficult due to the lack of sufficient point correspondences. We investigate an alternate approach exploiting the edge information from the line markings on the field. We formulate the registration problem as a nearest neighbour search over a synthetically generated dictionary of edge map and homography pairs. The synthetic dictionary generation allows us to exhaustively cover a wide variety of camera angles and positions and reduce this problem to a minimal per-frame edge map matching procedure. We show that the per-frame results can be improved in videos using an optimization framework for temporal camera stabilization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting extensive results on a dataset collected from matches of football World Cup 2014.	['Bharath Bhat', 'Vineet Gandhi', 'C. V.

Because of its marketing value, sports clubs are also motivated in creating and maintaining a stable audience in social media. In this paper, we analyze followers of prominent footballs clubs on Twitter by obtaining their home locations. We then measure how city size is connected to the number of followers using the theory of urban scaling. The results show that the scaling exponents of club followers depend on the income of a country. These findings could be used to understand the structure and potential growth areas of global football audiences.	['Attila Soti', 'Gabor Vattay']	107.0	arxiv

The method is implemented in the R add-on package GJRM and allows for modelling linear and non-linear dependence through the use of several copulae. Moreover, the parameters of the marginal distributions of the count responses and of the copula can be specified as flexible functions of covariates. Motivated by a football application, we also discuss an extension which forces the regression coefficients of the marginal (linear) predictors to be equal via a suitable penalisation. Model fitting is based on a trust region algorithm which estimates simultaneously all the parameters of the joint models. We investigate the proposal's empirical performance in two simulation studies, the first one designed for arbitrary count data, the other one reflecting football-specific settings. Finally, the method is applied to FIFA World Cup data, showing its competitiveness to the standard approach with regard to predictive performance.

Alcohol consumption often comes along with social events as it helps people to increase their sociability and to overcome their inhibitions. On the other hand we know that increased alcohol consumption can lead to serious health issues, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and diseases of the digestive system, to mention a few. This work examines alcohol consumption during the FIFA Football World Cup 2018, particularly the usage of alcohol related information on Twitter. For this we analyse the tweeting behaviour and show that the tournament strongly increases the interest in beer. Furthermore we show that countries who had to leave the tournament at early stage might have done something good to their fans as the interest in beer decreased again.

We model the game of football as a multi-stage game which is made up from a Bayesian game to model the pre-match decisions and a stochastic game to model the in-match state transitions and decisions. Using this formulation, we propose a method to predict the probability of game outcomes and the payoffs of team actions. Building upon this, we develop algorithms to optimise team formation and in-game tactics with different objectives. Empirical evaluation of our approach on real-world datasets from 760 matches shows that by using optimised tactics from our Bayesian and stochastic games, we can increase a team chances of winning by up to 16.1\% and 3.4\% respectively.

Specifically, we are concerned about the re-start of the Spanish national football league, La Liga, which is currently -May 2020- stopped with 11 fixtures remaining. Our model includes two additional states of an individual, confined and quarantined, which are reached when an individual presents COVID-19 symptoms or has undergone a virus test with a positive result. The model also accounts for the interaction dynamics of players, considering three different sources of infection: the player social circle, the contact with his/her team colleagues during training sessions, and the interaction with rivals during a match. Our results highlight the influence of the days between matches, the frequency of virus tests and their sensitivity on the number of players infected at the end of the season. Following our findings, we finally present a variety of strategies to minimize the probability that COVID-19 propagates in case the season of La Liga was re-started after the current lockdown.

However, existing orientation estimation methods, which are based on computer-vision techniques, still have a lot of room for improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this article presents the first deep learning model for estimating orientation directly from video footage. By approaching this challenge as a classification problem where classes correspond to orientation bins, and by introducing a cyclic loss function, a well-known convolutional network is refined to provide player orientation data. The model is trained by using ground-truth orientation data obtained from wearable EPTS devices, which are individually compensated with respect to the perceived orientation in the current frame. The obtained results outperform previous methods; in particular, the absolute median error is less than 12 degrees per player. An ablation study is included in order to show the potential generalization to any kind of football video footage.

Using Deep Learning to Value Defensive Actions in Football Event-Data	Charbel Merhej	2021-06-03 12:18:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01786v1	Objectively quantifying the value of player actions in football (soccer) is a challenging problem. To date, studies in football analytics have mainly focused on the attacking side of the game, while there has been less work on event-driven metrics for valuing defensive actions (e.g., tackles and interceptions). Therefore in this paper, we use deep learning techniques to define a novel metric that values such defensive actions by studying the threat of passages of play that preceded them. By doing so, we are able to value defensive actions based on what they prevented from happening in the game. Our Defensive Action Expected Threat (DAxT) model has been validated using real-world event-data from the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 English Premier League seasons, and we combine our model outputs with additional features to derive an overall rating of defensive ability for players. Overall, we find that our model is able to predict the impact of defensive actions allowing us to better value defenders using event-data.

We cluster these data based on a tailor-made dissimilarity measure. In order to decide between the many available clustering methods and to choose an appropriate number of clusters, we use the approach by Akhanli and Hennig (2020). This is based on several validation criteria that refer to different desirable characteristics of a clustering. These characteristics are chosen based on the aim of clustering, and this allows to define a suitable validation index as weighted average of calibrated individual indexes measuring the desirable features. We derive two different clusterings. The first one is a partition of the data set into major groups of essentially different players, which can be used for the analysis of a team's composition. The second one divides the data set into many small clusters (with 10 players on average), which can be used for finding players with a very similar profile to a given player. It is discussed in depth what characteristics are desirable for these clusterings. Weighting the criteria for the second clustering is informed by a survey of football experts.

134	The Second-Order Football-Pool Problem and the Optimal Rate of Generalized-Covering Codes	Dor Elimelech	2022-10-02 14:23:10	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00531v1	The goal of the classic football-pool problem is to determine how many lottery tickets are to be bought in order to guarantee at least $n-r$ correct guesses out of a sequence of $n$ games played. We study a generalized (second-order) version of this problem, in which any of these $n$ games consists of two sub-games. The second-order version of the football-pool problem is formulated using the notion of generalized-covering radius, recently proposed as a fundamental property of linear codes. We consider an extension of this property to general (not necessarily linear) codes, and provide an asymptotic solution to our problem by finding the optimal rate function of second-order covering codes given a fixed normalized covering radius. We also prove that the fraction of second-order covering codes among codes of sufficiently large rate tends to $1$ as the code length tends to $\infty$.	['Moshe Schwartz']	119.0	arxiv		
135	Going for GOAL: A Resource for Grounded Football Commentaries	Alessandro Suglia	2022-11-08 20:04:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04534v1	Recent video+language datasets cover domains where the interaction is highly structured, such as instructional videos, or where the interaction is scripted, such as TV shows. Both of these properties can lead to spurious cues to be exploited by models rather than learning to ground language. In this paper, we present GrOunded footbAlL commentaries (GOAL), a novel dataset of football (or `soccer') highlights videos with transcribed live commentaries in English. As the course of a game is unpredictable, so are commentaries, which makes them a unique resource to investigate dynamic language grounding. We also provide state-of-the-art baselines for the following tasks: frame reordering, moment retrieval, live commentary retrieval and play-by-play live commentary generation. Results show that SOTA models perform reasonably well in most tasks. We discuss the implications of these results and suggest new tasks for which GOAL can be used.

136	Location analysis of players in UEFA EURO 2020 and 2022 using generalized valuation of defense by estimating probabilities	Rikuhei Umemoto	2022-11-30 12:43:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00021v1	Analyzing defenses in team sports is generally challenging because of the limited event data. Researchers have previously proposed methods to evaluate football team defense by predicting the events of ball gain and being attacked using locations of all players and the ball. However, they did not consider the importance of the events, assumed the perfect observation of all 22 players, and did not fully investigated the influence of the diversity (e.g., nationality and sex). Here, we propose a generalized valuation method of defensive teams by score-scaling the predicted probabilities of the events. Using the open-source location data of all players in broadcast video frames in football games of men's Euro 2020 and women's Euro 2022, we investigated the effect of the number of players on the prediction and validated our approach by analyzing the games. Results show that for the predictions of being attacked, scoring, and conceding, all players' information was not necessary, while that of ball gain required information on three to four offensive and defensive players. With game analyses we explained the excellence in defense of finalist teams in Euro 2020. Our approach might be applicable to location data from broadcast video frames in football games.

137	Optimal selection of the starting lineup for a football team	Soudeep Deb	2023-03-22 08:49:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12385v2	The success of a football team depends on various individual skills and performances of the selected players as well as how cohesively they perform. We propose a two-stage process for selecting optimal playing eleven of a football team from its pool of available players. In the first stage a LASSO-induced modified multinomial logistic regression model is derived to analyse the probabilities of the three possible outcomes. The model considers strengths of the players in the team as well as those of the opponent, home advantage, and also the effects of individual players and player combinations beyond the recorded performances of these players. In the second stage, a GRASP-type meta-heuristic is implemented for the team selection which maximises its probability of winning. The work is illustrated with English Premier League data from 2008/09 to 2015/16. The application demonstrates that the model in the first stage furnishes valuable insights about the deciding factors for different teams whereas the optimisation steps can be effectively used to determine the best possible starting lineup under various circumstances. We propose a measure of efficiency in team selection by the team management and analyse the performance of the teams on this front.	['Shubhabrata Das']	122.0	arxiv		
138	European Football Player Valuation: Integrating Financial Models and Network Theory	Albert Cohen	2023-12-15 22:16:25	http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16179v1	"This paper presents a new framework for player valuation in European football by fusing principles from financial mathematics and network theory. The valuation model leverages a ""passing matrix"" to encapsulate player interactions on the field, utilizing centrality measures to quantify individual influence. Unlike traditional approaches, this model is both metric-driven and cohort-free, providing a dynamic and individualized framework for ascertaining a player's fair market value. The methodology is empirically validated through a case study in European football, employing real-world match and financial data. The paper advances the disciplines of sports analytics and financial mathematics by offering a cross-disciplinary mechanism for player valuation, and also links together two well-known econometric methods in marginal revenue product and expected present valuation."

139	Protocol for an Observational Study on the Effects of Playing High School Football on Later Life Cognitive Functioning and Mental Health	Sameer K. Deshpande	2016-07-06 19:37:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01756v1	A potential causal relationship between head injuries sustained by NFL players and later-life neurological decline may have broad implications for participants in youth and high school football programs. However, brain trauma risk at the professional level may be different than that at the youth and high school levels and the long-term effects of participation at these levels is as-yet unclear. To investigate the effect of playing high school football on later life depression and cognitive functioning, we propose a retrospective observational study using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) of graduates from Wisconsin high schools in 1957. We compare 1,153 high school males who played varsity football to 2,751 male students who did not. 1,951 of the control subjects did not play any sport and the remaining 800 controls played a non-contact sport. We focus on two primary outcomes measured at age 65: a composite cognitive outcome measuring verbal fluency and memory and the modified CES-D depression score. To control for potential confounders we adjust for pre-exposure covariates such as IQ with matching and model-based covariate adjustment. We will conduct an ordered testing procedure that uses all 2,751 controls while controlling for possible unmeasured differences between students who played sports and those who did not. We will quantitatively assess the sensitivity of the results to potential unmeasured confounding. The study will also consider several secondary outcomes of clinical interest such as aggression and heavy drinking. The rich set of pre-exposure variables, relatively unbiased sampling, and longitudinal nature of the WLS dataset make the proposed analysis unique among related studies that rely primarily on convenience samples of football players with reported neurological symptoms.

140	Large Scale Diverse Combinatorial Optimization: ESPN Fantasy Football Player Trades	Aaron Baughman	2021-11-04 13:39:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02859v3	Even skilled fantasy football managers can be disappointed by their mid-season rosters as some players inevitably fall short of draft day expectations. Team managers can quickly discover that their team has a low score ceiling even if they start their best active players. A novel and diverse combinatorial optimization system proposes high volume and unique player trades between complementary teams to balance trade fairness. Several algorithms create the valuation of each fantasy football player with an ensemble of computing models: Quantum Support Vector Classifier with Permutation Importance (QSVC-PI), Quantum Support Vector Classifier with Accumulated Local Effects (QSVC-ALE), Variational Quantum Circuit with Permutation Importance (VQC-PI), Hybrid Quantum Neural Network with Permutation Importance (HQNN-PI), eXtreme Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGB), and Subject Matter Expert (SME) rules. The valuation of each player is personalized based on league rules, roster, and selections. The cost of trading away a player is related to a team's roster, such as the depth at a position, slot count, and position importance. Teams are paired together for trading based on a cosine dissimilarity score so that teams can offset their strengths and weaknesses. A knapsack 0-1 algorithm computes outgoing players for each team. Postprocessors apply analytics and deep learning models to measure 6 different objective measures about each trade. Over the 2020 and 2021 National Football League (NFL) seasons, a group of 24 experts from IBM and ESPN evaluated trade quality through 10 Football Error Analysis Tool (FEAT) sessions. Our system started with 76.9% of high-quality trades and was deployed for the 2021 season with 97.3% of high-quality trades. To increase trade quantity, our quantum, classical, and rules-based computing have 100% trade uniqueness. We use Qiskit's quantum simulators throughout our work.

Comparing the Information Content of Games in the Four Major US Sports	Julian Wolfson	2015-01-28 16:31:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07179v1	"In the four major North American professional sports (baseball, basketball, football, and hockey), the primary purpose of the regular season is to determine which teams most deserve to advance to the playoffs. Interestingly, while the ultimate goal of identifying the best teams is the same, the number of regular season games played differs dramatically between the sports, ranging from 16 (football) to 82 (basketball and hockey) to 162 (baseball). Though length of season is partially determined by many factors including travel logistics, rest requirements, playoff structure and television contracts, it is hard to reconcile the 10-fold difference in the number of games between, for example, the NFL and MLB unless football games are somehow more ""informative"" than baseball games. In this paper, we aim to quantify the amount of information games yield about the relative strength of the teams involved. Our strategy is to assess how well simple paired comparison models fitted from $X%$ of the games within a season predict the outcomes of the remaining $(100-X)%$ of games, for multiple values of $X$. We compare the resulting predictive accuracy curves between seasons within the same sport and across all four sports, and find dramatic differences in the amount of information yielded by individual game results in the four major U.S. sports."

142	Robust analysis of second-leg home advantage in UEFA football through better nonparametric confidence intervals for binary regression functions	Gery Geenens	2017-01-26 02:49:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07555v1	In international football (soccer), two-legged knockout ties, with each team playing at home in one leg and the final outcome decided on aggregate, are common. Many players, managers and followers seem to believe in the `second-leg home advantage', i.e. that it is beneficial to play at home on the second leg. A more complex effect than the usual and well-established home advantage, it is harder to identify, and previous statistical studies did not prove conclusive about its actuality. Yet, given the amount of money handled in international football competitions nowadays, the question of existence or otherwise of this effect is of real import. As opposed to previous research, this paper addresses it from a purely nonparametric perspective and brings a very objective answer, not based on any particular model specification which could orientate the analysis in one or the other direction. Along the way, the paper reviews the well-known shortcomings of the Wald confidence interval for a proportion, suggests new nonparametric confidence intervals for conditional probability functions, revisits the problem of the bias when building confidence intervals in nonparametric regression, and provides a novel bootstrap-based solution to it. Finally, the new intervals are used in a careful analysis of game outcome data for the UEFA Champions and Europa leagues from 2009/10 to 2014/15. A slight `second-leg home advantage' is evidenced.

143	Predictive modelling of training loads and injury in Australian football	David L. Carey	2017-06-14 07:09:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04336v1	To investigate whether training load monitoring data could be used to predict injuries in elite Australian football players, data were collected from elite athletes over 3 seasons at an Australian football club. Loads were quantified using GPS devices, accelerometers and player perceived exertion ratings. Absolute and relative training load metrics were calculated for each player each day (rolling average, exponentially weighted moving average, acute:chronic workload ratio, monotony and strain). Injury prediction models (regularised logistic regression, generalised estimating equations, random forests and support vector machines) were built for non-contact, non-contact time-loss and hamstring specific injuries using the first two seasons of data. Injury predictions were generated for the third season and evaluated using the area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUC). Predictive performance was only marginally better than chance for models of non-contact and non-contact time-loss injuries (AUC$<$0.65). The best performing model was a multivariate logistic regression for hamstring injuries (best AUC=0.76). Learning curves suggested logistic regression was underfitting the load-injury relationship and that using a more complex model or increasing the amount of model building data may lead to future improvements. Injury prediction models built using training load data from a single club showed poor ability to predict injuries when tested on previously unseen data, suggesting they are limited as a daily decision tool for practitioners. Focusing the modelling approach on specific injury types and increasing the amount of training data may lead to the development of improved predictive models for injury prevention.

144	Passive Cervical Spine Ligaments Provide Stability during Head Impacts in Vivo	Calvin Kuo	2019-04-02 18:17:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03102v1	It has long been suggested that neck muscle strength and anticipatory cocontraction can decrease head motions during head impacts. Here, we quantify the relative angular impulse contributions of neck soft tissue to head stabilization using a musculoskeletal model with Hill-type muscles and rate-dependent ligaments. We simulated sagittal extension and lateral flexion mild experimental head impacts performed on 10 subjects with relaxed or cocontracted muscles, and median American football head impacts. We estimated angular impulses from active muscle, passive muscle, and ligaments during head impact acceleration and deceleration phases. During the acceleration phase, active musculature produced resistive angular impulses that were 30% of the impact angular impulse in experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. This was reduced below 20% in football impacts. During the deceleration phase, active musculature stabilized the head with 50% of the impact angular impulse in experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. However, passive ligaments provided greater stabilizing angular impulses in football impacts. The redistribution of stabilizing angular impulses results from ligament and muscle dependence on lengthening rate, where ligaments stiffen substantially compared to active muscle at high lengthening rates. Thus, ligaments provide relatively greater deceleration impulses in these impacts, which limits the effectiveness of muscle strengthening or anticipated activations.

145	Alterations in Structural Correlation Networks with Prior Concussion in Collision-Sport Athletes	Muhammad Usman Sadiq	2019-04-18 17:34:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10924v1	Several studies have used structural correlation networks, derived from anatomical covariance of brain regions, to analyze neurologic changes associated with multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia and breast cancer [1][2]. Graph-theoretical analyses of human brain structural networks have consistently shown the characteristic of small-worldness that reflects a network with both high segregation and high integration. A large neuroimaging literature on football players, with and without history of concussion, has shown both functional and anatomical changes. Here we use graph-based topological properties of anatomical correlation networks to study the effect of prior concussion in collision-sport athletes. 40 high school collision-sport athletes (23 male football, 17 female soccer; CSA) without self-reported history of concussion (HOC-), 18 athletes (13 male football, 5 female soccer) with self-reported history of concussion (HOC+) and 24 healthy controls (19 male, 5 female; CN) participated in imaging sessions before the beginning of a competition season. The extracted residual volumes for each group were used for building the correlation networks and their small-worldness, , is calculated. The small-worldness of CSA without prior history of concussion, , is significantly greater than that of controls, . CSA with prior history have significantly higher (vs. 95% confidence interval) small-worldness compared to HOC+, over a range of network densities. The longer path lengths in HOC+ group could indicate disrupted neuronal integration relative to healthy controls.

146	Evaluating probabilistic forecasts of football matches: The case against the Ranked Probability Score	Edward Wheatcroft	2019-08-23 19:04:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08980v1	A scoring rule is a function of a probabilistic forecast and a corresponding outcome that is used to evaluate forecast performance. A wide range of scoring rules have been defined over time and there is some debate as to which are the most appropriate for evaluating the performance of forecasts of sporting events. This paper focuses on forecasts of the outcomes of football matches. The ranked probability score (RPS) is often recommended since it is `sensitive to distance', that is it takes into account the ordering in the outcomes (a home win is `closer' to a draw than it is to an away win, for example). In this paper, this reasoning is disputed on the basis that it adds nothing in terms of the actual aims of using scoring rules. A related property of scoring rules is locality. A scoring rule is local if it only takes the probability placed on the outcome into consideration. Two simulation experiments are carried out in the context of football matches to compare the performance of the RPS, which is non-local and sensitive to distance, the Brier score, which is non-local and insensitive to distance, and the ignorance score, which is local and insensitive to distance. The ignorance score is found to outperform both the RPS and the Brier score, casting doubt on the value of non-locality and sensitivity to distance as properties of scoring rules in this context.

147	"""Does 4-4-2 exist?"" -- An Analytics Approach to Understand and Classify Football Team Formations in Single Match Situations"	Eric Müller-Budack	2019-09-02 16:14:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00412v1	The chances to win a football match can be significantly increased if the right tactic is chosen and the behavior of the opposite team is well anticipated. For this reason, every professional football club employs a team of game analysts. However, at present game performance analysis is done manually and therefore highly time-consuming. Consequently, automated tools to support the analysis process are required. In this context, one of the main tasks is to summarize team formations by patterns such as 4-4-2. In this paper, we introduce an analytics approach that automatically classifies and visualizes the team formation based on the players' position data. We focus on single match situations instead of complete halftimes or matches to provide a more detailed analysis. A detailed analysis of individual match situations depending on ball possession and match segment length is provided. For this purpose, a visual summary is utilized that summarizes the team formation in a match segment. An expert annotation study is conducted that demonstrates 1) the complexity of the task and 2) the usefulness of the visualization of single situations to understand team formations. The suggested classification approach outperforms existing methods for formation classification. In particular, our approach gives insights about the shortcomings of using patterns like 4-4-2 to describe team formations.	['Jonas Theiner', 'Robert Rein', 'Ralph Ewerth']	132.0	arxiv		
148	Prevention of Traumatic Brain Injury with Liquid Shock Absorption	Hossein Vahid Alizadeh	2019-10-17 05:47:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07722v1	The discovery that repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can result in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in high risk contact sports has led to increased scrutiny of head protective gear. In this work, we asked if it was physically possible to prevent mTBI in American football with helmets alone. Here, we show that modern helmets of several types are unlikely to prevent mTBI from high speed collisions as might be seen in the NFL, but that introducing liquid as an energy absorbing medium can dramatically reduce the forces of impact across a spectrum of impact severities. We hypothesized that a helmet which transmits a nearly constant force during football impacts is sufficient to reduce biomechanical loading in the brain below the threshold of mTBI. To test this hypothesis, we first show that the optimal impact force transmitted to the head, in terms of brain strain, is in fact a constant force profile. Then, to generate a constant force with a helmet, we implement a computational model of a fluid-based shock absorber that adapts passively to any given impact speed. Computer simulation of head impacts with liquid shock absorption indicate that, at the highest impact speed, the average brain tissue strain is reduced by 27.6% $\pm$ 9.3 compared to existing helmet padding that is available on the market. These simulations are based on the NFL's helmet test protocol and predict that adding liquid shock absorbers could reduce the number of concussions by at least 75%. Taken together, these results suggest that the majority of mTBI in football could be prevented with more efficient helmet technology.	['Michael G. Fanton', 'August G.

149	Robustness of football passing networks against continuous node and link removals	Genki Ichinose	2020-03-27 10:05:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13465v2	We can construct passing networks when we regard a player as a node and a pass as a link in football games. Thus, we can analyze the networks by using tools developed in network science. Among various metrics characterizing a network, centrality metrics have often been used to identify key players in a passing network. However, a tolerance to players being marked or passes being blocked in a passing network, namely the robustness of the network, has been poorly understood so far. Because the robustness of a passing network can be connected to the increase of ball possession, it would be deeply related to the outcome of a game. Here, we developed position-dependent passing networks of 45 matches by 18 teams belonging to the Japan Professional Football League. Then, nodes or links were continuously removed from the passing networks by two removal methods so that we could evaluate the robustness of these networks against the removals. The results show that these passing networks commonly contain hubs (key players making passes). Then, we analyzed the most robust networks in detail and found that their full backs increase the robustness by often invoking a heavier emphasis on attack. Moreover, we showed that the robustness of the passing networks and the team performance have a positive correlation.	['Tomohiro Tsuchiya', 'Shunsuke Watanabe']	134.0	arxiv		
150	Validation and Comparison of Instrumented Mouthguards for Measuring Head Kinematics and Assessing Brain Deformation in Football Impacts	Yuzhe Liu	2020-08-05 01:41:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01903v2	Because of the relatively rigid coupling between the upper dentition and the skull, instrumented mouthguards have been shown to be a viable way of measuring head impact kinematics for assisting in understanding the underlying biomechanics of concussions. This has led various companies and institutions to further develop instrumented mouthguards. However, their use as a research tool for understanding concussive impacts makes quantification of their accuracy critical, especially given the conflicting results from various recent studies. Here we present a study that uses a pneumatic impactor to deliver impacts characteristic to football to a Hybrid III headform, in order to validate and compare five of the most commonly used instrumented mouthguards. We found that all tested mouthguards gave accurate measurements for the peak angular acceleration (mean relative error, MRE < 13%), the peak angular velocity (MRE < 8%), brain injury criteria values (MRE < 13%) and brain deformation (described as maximum principal strain and fiber strain, calculated by a convolutional neural network based brain model, MRE < 9%). Finally, we found that the accuracy of the measurement varies with the impact locations yet is not sensitive to the impact velocity for the most part.	['August G.

151	G-Elo: Generalization of the Elo algorithm by modelling the discretized margin of victory	Leszek Szczecinski	2020-10-20 03:55:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11187v3	In this work we develop a new algorithm for rating of teams (or players) in one-on-one games by exploiting the observed difference of the game-points (such as goals), also known as a margin of victory (MOV). Our objective is to obtain the Elo-style algorithm whose operation is simple to implement and to understand intuitively. This is done in three steps: first, we define the probabilistic model between the teams' skills and the discretized MOV variable: this generalizes the model underpinning the Elo algorithm, where the MOV variable is discretized into three categories (win/loss/draw). Second, with the formal probabilistic model at hand, the optimization required by the maximum likelihood rule is implemented via stochastic gradient; this yields simple on-line equations for the rating updates which are identical in their general form to those characteristic of the Elo algorithm: the main difference lies in the way the scores and the expected scores are defined. Third, we propose a simple method to estimate the coefficients of the model, and thus define the operation of the algorithm; it is done in a closed form using the historical data so the algorithm is tailored to the sport of interest and the coefficients defining its operation are determined in entirely transparent manner. The alternative, optimization-based strategy to find the coefficients is also presented. We show numerical examples based on the results of the association football of the English Premier League and the American football of the National Football League.	[]	136.0	arxiv		
152	Time-series Imputation of Temporally-occluded Multiagent Trajectories	Shayegan Omidshafiei	2021-06-08 09:58:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04219v1	In multiagent environments, several decision-making individuals interact while adhering to the dynamics constraints imposed by the environment. These interactions, combined with the potential stochasticity of the agents' decision-making processes, make such systems complex and interesting to study from a dynamical perspective. Significant research has been conducted on learning models for forward-direction estimation of agent behaviors, for example, pedestrian predictions used for collision-avoidance in self-driving cars. However, in many settings, only sporadic observations of agents may be available in a given trajectory sequence. For instance, in football, subsets of players may come in and out of view of broadcast video footage, while unobserved players continue to interact off-screen. In this paper, we study the problem of multiagent time-series imputation, where available past and future observations of subsets of agents are used to estimate missing observations for other agents. Our approach, called the Graph Imputer, uses forward- and backward-information in combination with graph networks and variational autoencoders to enable learning of a distribution of imputed trajectories. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of football matches, using a projective camera module to train and evaluate our model for the off-screen player state estimation setting. We illustrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches, including those hand-crafted for football.

153	Frame by frame completion probability of an NFL pass	Gustavo Pompeu da Silva	2021-09-16 15:34:56	http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08051v1	American football is an increasingly popular sport, with a growing audience in many countries in the world. The most watched American football league in the world is the United States' National Football League (NFL), where every offensive play can be either a run or a pass, and in this work we focus on passes. Many factors can affect the probability of pass completion, such as receiver separation from the nearest defender, distance from receiver to passer, offense formation, among many others. When predicting the completion probability of a pass, it is essential to know who the target of the pass is. By using distance measures between players and the ball, it is possible to calculate empirical probabilities and predict very accurately who the target will be. The big question is: how likely is it for a pass to be completed in an NFL match while the ball is in the air? We developed a machine learning algorithm to answer this based on several predictors. Using data from the 2018 NFL season, we obtained conditional and marginal predictions for pass completion probability based on a random forest model. This is based on a two-stage procedure: first, we calculate the probability of each offensive player being the pass target, then, conditional on the target, we predict completion probability based on the random forest model. Finally, the general completion probability can be calculated using the law of total probability. We present animations for selected plays and show the pass completion probability evolution.

During this observation period, the 2016 UEFA European Football Championship took place, which affected significantly the habit of the residents, despite the fact that not a single match was played in the city. We evaluated the fans' behavior in Budapest, during and after the Hungarian matches, and found that the mobile phone network activity reflects the football fans' behavior, demonstrating the potential of mobile phone network data within a social sensing system. The Call Detail Records are enriched with mobile phone properties to analyze the subscribers' devices. Applying the device information (Type Allocation Code) from the activity records, the Subscriber Identity Modules, that do not operate in cell phones are omitted from mobility analyses, allowing to focus on people. The mobile phone price is proposed and evaluated as a socioeconomic indicator, and correlation between the phone price and the mobility customs have been found. We also found that, beside the cell phone price, the subscriber age and the subscription type also have an effect on the mobility. On the other hand, these do not seem to affect the interest in football.	['Imre Felde']	139.0	arxiv		
155	A Survey on Video Action Recognition in Sports: Datasets, Methods and Applications	Fei Wu	2022-06-02 13:19:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01038v1	To understand human behaviors, action recognition based on videos is a common approach. Compared with image-based action recognition, videos provide much more information. Reducing the ambiguity of actions and in the last decade, many works focused on datasets, novel models and learning approaches have improved video action recognition to a higher level. However, there are challenges and unsolved problems, in particular in sports analytics where data collection and labeling are more sophisticated, requiring sport professionals to annotate data. In addition, the actions could be extremely fast and it becomes difficult to recognize them. Moreover, in team sports like football and basketball, one action could involve multiple players, and to correctly recognize them, we need to analyse all players, which is relatively complicated. In this paper, we present a survey on video action recognition for sports analytics. We introduce more than ten types of sports, including team sports, such as football, basketball, volleyball, hockey and individual sports, such as figure skating, gymnastics, table tennis, tennis, diving and badminton.

156	Preliminary Examination of Guardian Cap Head Impact Data Using Instrumented Mouthguards	Kristen G. Quigley	2023-02-21 22:44:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11038v1	Purpose The objective of this study is to present preliminary on-field head kinematics data for NCAA Division I American football players through closely matched pre-season workouts both with and without Guardian Caps (GCs). Methods 42 NCAA Division I American football players wore instrumented mouthguards (iMMs) for 6 closely matched workouts, 3 in traditional helmets (PRE) and 3 with GCs (POST) affixed to the exterior of their helmets. This includes 7 players who had consistent data through all workouts. Results There was no significant difference between the collapsed mean values for the entire sample between PRE and POST for peak linear acceleration (PLA) (PRE=16.3, POST=17.2Gs; p=0.20), Peak Angular Acceleration (PAA) (PRE=992.1, POST=1029.4rad/s2; p=0.51 and the total amount of impacts (PRE=9.3, POST=9.7; p=0.72). Similarly, no difference was observed between PRE and POST for PLA (PRE=16.1, POST=17.2Gs; p=0.32), PAA (PRE=951.2, POST=1038.0rad/s2; p=0.29 and total impacts (PRE=9.6, POST=9.7; p=0.32) between sessions for the 7 repeated players. Conclusion These data suggest no difference in head kinematics data (PLA, PAA and total impacts) when GCs are worn. This study suggests GCs are not effective in reducing the magnitude of head impacts experienced by NCAA Division I American football players.	['Dustin Hopfe', 'Madison R.

157	Embedding Contextual Information through Reward Shaping in Multi-Agent Learning: A Case Study from Google Football	Chaoyi Gu	2023-03-25 10:21:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15471v3	Artificial Intelligence has been used to help human complete difficult tasks in complicated environments by providing optimized strategies for decision-making or replacing the manual labour. In environments including multiple agents, such as football, the most common methods to train agents are Imitation Learning and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, the agents trained by Imitation Learning cannot outperform the expert demonstrator, which makes humans hardly get new insights from the learnt policy. Besides, MARL is prone to the credit assignment problem. In environments with sparse reward signal, this method can be inefficient. The objective of our research is to create a novel reward shaping method by embedding contextual information in reward function to solve the aforementioned challenges. We demonstrate this in the Google Research Football (GRF) environment. We quantify the contextual information extracted from game state observation and use this quantification together with original sparse reward to create the shaped reward. The experiment results in the GRF environment prove that our reward shaping method is a useful addition to state-of-the-art MARL algorithms for training agents in environments with sparse reward signal.

158	Adaptive action supervision in reinforcement learning from real-world multi-agent demonstrations	Keisuke Fujii	2023-05-22 13:33:37	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13030v4	Modeling of real-world biological multi-agents is a fundamental problem in various scientific and engineering fields. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework to generate flexible and diverse behaviors in cyberspace; however, when modeling real-world biological multi-agents, there is a domain gap between behaviors in the source (i.e., real-world data) and the target (i.e., cyberspace for RL), and the source environment parameters are usually unknown. In this paper, we propose a method for adaptive action supervision in RL from real-world demonstrations in multi-agent scenarios. We adopt an approach that combines RL and supervised learning by selecting actions of demonstrations in RL based on the minimum distance of dynamic time warping for utilizing the information of the unknown source dynamics. This approach can be easily applied to many existing neural network architectures and provide us with an RL model balanced between reproducibility as imitation and generalization ability to obtain rewards in cyberspace. In the experiments, using chase-and-escape and football tasks with the different dynamics between the unknown source and target environments, we show that our approach achieved a balance between the reproducibility and the generalization ability compared with the baselines. In particular, we used the tracking data of professional football players as expert demonstrations in football and show successful performances despite the larger gap between behaviors in the source and target environments than the chase-and-escape task.

159	A Strategic Framework for Optimal Decisions in Football 1-vs-1 Shot-Taking Situations: An Integrated Approach of Machine Learning, Theory-Based Modeling, and Game Theory	Calvin C. K. Yeung	2023-07-27 09:42:25	http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14732v1	Complex interactions between two opposing agents frequently occur in domains of machine learning, game theory, and other application domains. Quantitatively analyzing the strategies involved can provide an objective basis for decision-making. One such critical scenario is shot-taking in football, where decisions, such as whether the attacker should shoot or pass the ball and whether the defender should attempt to block the shot, play a crucial role in the outcome of the game. However, there are currently no effective data-driven and/or theory-based approaches to analyzing such situations. To address this issue, we proposed a novel framework to analyze such scenarios based on game theory, where we estimate the expected payoff with machine learning (ML) models, and additional features for ML models were extracted with a theory-based shot block model. Conventionally, successes or failures (1 or 0) are used as payoffs, while a success shot (goal) is extremely rare in football. Therefore, we proposed the Expected Probability of Shot On Target (xSOT) metric to evaluate players' actions even if the shot results in no goal; this allows for effective differentiation and comparison between different shots and even enables counterfactual shot situation analysis. In our experiments, we have validated the framework by comparing it with baseline and ablated models. Furthermore, we have observed a high correlation between the xSOT and existing metrics. This alignment of information suggests that xSOT provides valuable insights. Lastly, as an illustration, we studied optimal strategies in the World Cup 2022 and analyzed a shot situation in EURO 2020.	['Keisuke Fujii']	144.0	arxiv		
160	SciSports: Learning football kinematics through two-dimensional tracking data	Anatoliy Babic	2018-08-14 06:40:01	http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04550v1	SciSports is a Dutch startup company specializing in football analytics. This paper describes a joint research effort with SciSports, during the Study Group Mathematics with Industry 2018 at Eindhoven, the Netherlands. The main challenge that we addressed was to automatically process empirical football players' trajectories, in order to extract useful information from them. The data provided to us was two-dimensional positional data during entire matches. We developed methods based on Newtonian mechanics and the Kalman filter, Generative Adversarial Nets and Variational Autoencoders. In addition, we trained a discriminator network to recognize and discern different movement patterns of players. The Kalman-filter approach yields an interpretable model, in which a small number of player-dependent parameters can be fit; in theory this could be used to distinguish among players. The Generative-Adversarial-Nets approach appears promising in theory, and some initial tests showed an improvement with respect to the baseline, but the limits in time and computational power meant that we could not fully explore it. We also trained a Discriminator network to distinguish between two players based on their trajectories; after training, the network managed to distinguish between some pairs of players, but not between others. After training, the Variational Autoencoders generated trajectories that are difficult to distinguish, visually, from the data. These experiments provide an indication that deep generative models can learn the underlying structure and statistics of football players' trajectories. This can serve as a starting point for determining player qualities based on such trajectory data.

162	TacticAI: an AI assistant for football tactics	Zhe Wang	2023-10-16 16:25:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10553v2	Identifying key patterns of tactics implemented by rival teams, and developing effective responses, lies at the heart of modern football. However, doing so algorithmically remains an open research challenge. To address this unmet need, we propose TacticAI, an AI football tactics assistant developed and evaluated in close collaboration with domain experts from Liverpool FC. We focus on analysing corner kicks, as they offer coaches the most direct opportunities for interventions and improvements. TacticAI incorporates both a predictive and a generative component, allowing the coaches to effectively sample and explore alternative player setups for each corner kick routine and to select those with the highest predicted likelihood of success. We validate TacticAI on a number of relevant benchmark tasks: predicting receivers and shot attempts and recommending player position adjustments. The utility of TacticAI is validated by a qualitative study conducted with football domain experts at Liverpool FC. We show that TacticAI's model suggestions are not only indistinguishable from real tactics, but also favoured over existing tactics 90% of the time, and that TacticAI offers an effective corner kick retrieval system. TacticAI achieves these results despite the limited availability of gold-standard data, achieving data efficiency through geometric deep learning.

The probability density functions (PDFs) of goals scored cannot be fitted over their entire ranges by Poisson or negative binomial distributions; here, we compare the PDFs with those arising from extremal statistics. In addition, we show that it is sufficient to model English top division and FA Cup matches in the seasons of 1970/71 to 2000/01 on Poisson or negative binomial distributions, as reported in analyses of earlier seasons, and that these are not consistent with extremal statistics.

The compactification manifold has the topology of a two-sphere, and is stabilized by a bulk cosmological constant and magnetic flux. The geometry of the sphere is locally round except for conical singularities at the locations of two antipodal branes, deforming the sphere into an American-style football. The bulk magnetic flux needs to be fine-tuned to obtain flat geometry on the branes. Once this is done, the brane geometry is insensitive to the brane vacuum energy, which only affects the conical deficit angle of the extra dimensions. Solutions of this form provide a new arena in which to explore brane-world phenomenology and the effects of extra dimensions on the cosmological constant problem.	['Monica M. Guica']	150.0	arxiv

As a consequence, we obtain the football solution with 4D Minkowski space as a new supersymmetric background that preserves 4D N=1 SUSY. In the presence of brane multiplets, we derive the 4D effective supergravity action for the football background and show that the remaining modulus can be stabilized by a bulk non-perturbative correction with brane uplifting potentials at a zero vacuum energy. We find that the U(1)_R mediation can be a dominant source of SUSY breaking for a brane scalar with nonzero R charge.	[]	152.0	arxiv		
168	Synthesis of supervised classification algorithm using intelligent and statistical tools	Ali Douik	2009-12-11 18:14:29	http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2302v1	A fundamental task in detecting foreground objects in both static and dynamic scenes is to take the best choice of color system representation and the efficient technique for background modeling. We propose in this paper a non-parametric algorithm dedicated to segment and to detect objects in color images issued from a football sports meeting. Indeed segmentation by pixel concern many applications and revealed how the method is robust to detect objects, even in presence of strong shadows and highlights. In the other hand to refine their playing strategy such as in football, handball, volley ball, Rugby..., the coach need to have a maximum of technical-tactics information about the on-going of the game and the players. We propose in this paper a range of algorithms allowing the resolution of many problems appearing in the automated process of team identification, where each player is affected to his corresponding team relying on visual data. The developed system was tested on a match of the Tunisian national competition. This work is prominent for many next computer vision studies as it's detailed in this study.

The two extra dimensions topologically represent a 2-torus which is stabilized by a bulk cosmological constant and magnetic flux. The torus has positive constant curvature almost everywhere, except for a single conical singularity at the location of the brane. In contradistinction to the football shaped case, there is no fine-tuning required for the brane tension. We also present some plausibility arguments why the model should not suffer from serious stability issues.	['Gunther Cornelissen']	154.0	arxiv

The resulting network or graph provides a direct visual inspection of a team's strategy, from which we can identify play pattern, determine hot-spots on the play and localize potential weaknesses. Using different centrality measures, we can also determine the relative importance of each player in the game, the `popularity' of a player, and the effect of removing players from the game.

In a series of six variations on this theme, we prove corresponding results for principal bundles over the following schemes and stacks: (1) a line modulo the group of nth roots of unity; (2) a football, that is, an orbifold of genus zero with two marked points; (3) a gerbe over a football whose structure group is the nth roots of unity; (4) a chain of lines meeting in nodes; (5) a line modulo an action of a split torus; and (6) a chain modulo an action of a split torus. We also prove that the automorphism groups of such bundles are smooth, affine, and connected.	['Michael Thaddeus']	156.0	arxiv

We investigate the problem of producing an automated system to make the same evaluation of passes. We present a model that constructs numerical predictor variables from spatiotemporal match data using feature functions based on methods from computational geometry, and then learns a classification function from labelled examples of the predictor variables. Furthermore, the learned classifiers are analysed to determine if there is a relationship between the complexity of the algorithm that computed the predictor variable and the importance of the variable to the classifier. Experimental results show that we are able to produce a classifier with 85.8% accuracy on classifying passes as Good, OK or Bad, and that the predictor variables computed using complex methods from computational geometry are of moderate importance to the learned classifiers. Finally, we show that the inter-rater agreement on pass classification between the machine classifier and a human observer is of similar magnitude to the agreement between two observers.

Here we use Japanese and German football data to investigate correlates between temporal patterns of formation changes across matches and match results. We found that individual teams and managers both showed win-stay lose-shift behavior, a type of reinforcement learning. In other words, they tended to stick to the current formation after a win and switch to a different formation after a loss. In addition, formation changes did not statistically improve the results of succeeding matches.The results indicate that a swift implementation of a new formation in the win-stay lose-shift manner may not be a successful managerial rule of thumb.

Through skill and chance, the script of each game is dynamically written in real time by players acting out possible trajectories allowed by a sport's rules. By properly characterizing a given sport's ecology of `game stories', we are able to capture the sport's capacity for unfolding interesting narratives, in part by contrasting them with random walks. Here, we explore the game story space afforded by a data set of 1,310 Australian Football League (AFL) score lines. We find that AFL games exhibit a continuous spectrum of stories rather than distinct clusters. We show how coarse-graining reveals identifiable motifs ranging from last minute comeback wins to one-sided blowouts. Through an extensive comparison with biased random walks, we show that real AFL games deliver a broader array of motifs than null models, and we provide consequent insights into the narrative appeal of real games.

Especially, we find that there exists a characteristic interpersonal distance $ r\simeq 500 $ cm below which the circular variance for their alignment decreases rapidly. By introducing the order parameter $ \phi(t) $ in order to measure degree of alignment of players' velocity vectors, we also find that the angle distribution between the nearest players' velocity vectors becomes wrapped Cauchy ($ \phi \lesssim 0.7 $) and the mixture of von Mises and wrapped Cauchy distributions ($ \phi \gtrsim 0.7 $), respectively. To understand these findings, we construct a simple model for the motion of the two interacting players with the following rules: chasing between the players and the reset of the chasing. We numerically show that our model successfully reproduce the results obtained from the actual data. Moreover, from the numerical study, we find that there is another characteristic distance $ r\simeq 1000 $ cm below which player's chasing starts.	['Yoshihiro Yamazaki']	163.0	arxiv

The second variation makes use of in-play probabilities of match outcome to evaluate an expected points plus-minus rating. We use the ratings to examine who are the best players in European football, and demonstrate how the players' ratings evolve over time. Finally, we shed light on the debate regarding which is the strongest league. The model suggests the English Premier League is the strongest, with the German Bundesliga a close runner-up.

Whitaker	2017-09-25 13:47:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00001v2	We consider the task of determining a football player's ability for a given event type, for example, scoring a goal. We propose an interpretable Bayesian model which is fit using variational inference methods. We implement a Poisson model to capture occurrences of event types, from which we infer player abilities. Our approach also allows the visualisation of differences between players, for a specific ability, through the marginal posterior variational densities. We then use these inferred player abilities to extend the Bayesian hierarchical model of Baio and Blangiardo (2010) which captures a team's scoring rate (the rate at which they score goals). We apply the resulting scheme to the English Premier League, capturing player abilities over the 2013/2014 season, before using output from the hierarchical model to predict whether over or under 2.5 goals will be scored in a given game in the 2014/2015 season. This validates our model as a way of providing insights into team formation and the individual success of sports teams.	['Ricardo Silva', 'Daniel Edwards', 'Ioannis Kosmidis']	165.0	arxiv

183	Unsupervised Methods for Identifying Pass Coverage Among Defensive Backs with NFL Player Tracking Data	Rishav Dutta	2019-06-26 22:48:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11373v3	"Analysis of player tracking data for American football is in its infancy, since the National Football League (NFL) released its Next Gen Stats tracking data publicly for the first time in December 2018. While tracking datasets in other sports often contain detailed annotations of on-field events, annotations in the NFL's tracking data are limited. Methods for creating these annotations typically require extensive human labeling, which is difficult and expensive. We begin tackling this class of problems by creating annotations for pass coverage types by defensive backs using unsupervised learning techniques, which require no manual labeling or human oversight. We define a set of features from the NFL's tracking data that help distinguish between ""zone"" and ""man"" coverage. We use Gaussian mixture modeling and hierarchical clustering to create clusters corresponding to each group, and we assign the appropriate type of coverage to each cluster through qualitative analysis of the plays in each cluster. We find that the mixture model's ""soft"" cluster assignments allow for more flexibility when identifying coverage types. Our work makes possible several potential avenues of future NFL research, and we provide a basic exploration of these in this paper."	['Ronald Yurko', 'Samuel Ventura']	168.0	arxiv		
184	Fitting motion models to contextual player behavior	Bartholomew Spencer	2019-07-24 22:32:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10762v1	The objective of this study was to incorporate contextual information into the modelling of player movements. This was achieved by combining the distributions of forthcoming passing contests that players committed to and those they did not. The resultant array measures the probability a player would commit to forthcoming contests in their vicinity. Commitment-based motion models were fit on 46220 samples of player behavior in the Australian Football League. It was found that the shape of commitment-based models differed greatly to displacement-based models for Australian footballers. Player commitment arrays were used to measure the spatial occupancy and dominance of the attacking team. The spatial characteristics of pass receivers were extracted for 2934 passes. Positional trends in passing were identified. Furthermore, passes were clustered into three components using Gaussian mixture models. Passes in the AFL are most commonly to one-on-one contests or unmarked players. Furthermore, passes were rarely greater than 25 m.	['Karl Jackson', 'Sam Robertson']	169.0	arxiv		
185	SEED RL: Scalable and Efficient Deep-RL with Accelerated Central Inference	Lasse Espeholt	2019-10-15 08:32:45	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06591v2	We present a modern scalable reinforcement learning agent called SEED (Scalable, Efficient Deep-RL). By effectively utilizing modern accelerators, we show that it is not only possible to train on millions of frames per second but also to lower the cost of experiments compared to current methods. We achieve this with a simple architecture that features centralized inference and an optimized communication layer. SEED adopts two state of the art distributed algorithms, IMPALA/V-trace (policy gradients) and R2D2 (Q-learning), and is evaluated on Atari-57, DeepMind Lab and Google Research Football. We improve the state of the art on Football and are able to reach state of the art on Atari-57 three times faster in wall-time. For the scenarios we consider, a 40% to 80% cost reduction for running experiments is achieved. The implementation along with experiments is open-sourced so results can be reproduced and novel ideas tried out.	['Raphaël Marinier', 'Piotr Stanczyk', 'Ke Wang', 'Marcin Michalski']	170.0	arxiv		
186	The UEFA Champions League seeding is not strategy-proof since the 2015/16 season	László Csató	2019-12-14 08:23:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06804v3	Fairness has several interpretations in sports, one of them being that the rules should guarantee incentive compatibility, namely, a team cannot be worse off due to better results in any feasible scenario. The current seeding regime of the most prestigious annual European club football tournament, the UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) Champions League, is shown to violate this requirement since the 2015/16 season. In particular, if the titleholder qualifies for the first pot by being a champion in a high-ranked league, its slot is given to a team from a lower-ranked association, which can harm a top club from the domestic championship of the titleholder. However, filling all vacancies through the national leagues excludes the presence of perverse incentives. UEFA is encouraged to introduce this policy from the 2021-24 cycle onwards.	[]	171.0	arxiv		
187	Simulation-Based Decision Making in the NFL using NFLSimulatoR	Benjamin Williams	2021-02-03 02:44:01	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01846v3	In this paper, we introduce an R software package for simulating plays and drives using play-by-play data from the National Football League. The simulations are generated by sampling play-by-play data from previous football seasons.The sampling procedure adds statistical rigor to any decisions or inferences arising from examining the simulations. We highlight that the package is particularly useful as a data-driven tool for evaluating potential in-game strategies or rule changes within the league. We demonstrate its utility by evaluating the oft-debated strategy of $\textit{going for it}$ on fourth down and investigating whether or not teams should pass more than the current standard.

188	Collision Prediction and Prevention in Contact Sports Using RFID tags and Haptic Feedback	Moeen Mostafavi	2021-02-06 00:08:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03453v1	American football is a leading sport for contact-related injuries such as cervical spine injuries, some of which result from an unforeseen hit. The use of a feedback mechanism to alert an athlete of a potential hit may mitigate the risk for sport-related concussion and catastrophic injury by allowing athletes to effectively brace for an otherwise unforeseen impact. In this project, we created a proximity sensor system using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to send haptic feedback to the wearer before a potential impact. Our pilot test consisted of three participants who wore our novel sensor system, who ran simulated routes to represent player-to-player contact. Additionally, we used simulated data from a Network Live Football (NFL) league game to further validate our contact prediction algorithm. Results show that our method can predict players' collisions with less than 14% false-alarms.	['Fateme Nikseresht', 'Jacob Earl Resch', 'Laura Barnes', 'Mehdi Boukhechba']	173.0	arxiv		
189	Optimising Long-Term Outcomes using Real-World Fluent Objectives: An Application to Football	Ryan Beal	2021-02-18 16:42:04	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09469v1	In this paper, we present a novel approach for optimising long-term tactical and strategic decision-making in football (soccer) by encapsulating events in a league environment across a given time frame. We model the teams' objectives for a season and track how these evolve as games unfold to give a fluent objective that can aid in decision-making games. We develop Markov chain Monte Carlo and deep learning-based algorithms that make use of the fluent objectives in order to learn from prior games and other games in the environment and increase the teams' long-term performance. Simulations of our approach using real-world datasets from 760 matches shows that by using optimised tactics with our fluent objective and prior games, we can on average increase teams mean expected finishing distribution in the league by up to 35.6%.

190	Forecasting number of corner kicks taken in association football using compound Poisson distribution	Stan Yip	2021-12-24 08:50:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13001v3	This article presents a holistic compound Poisson regression model framework to forecast number of corner kicks taken in association football. Corner kick taken events are often decisive in the match outcome and inherently arrive in batch with serial clustering pattern. Providing parameter estimates with intuitive interpretation, a class of compound Poisson regression including a Bayesian implementation of geometric-Poisson distribution is introduced. With a varying shape parameter, the corner counts serial correlation between matches is handled naturally within the Bayesian model. In this study, information elicited from cross-market betting odds was used to improve the model predictability. Margin application methods to adjust market inefficiency in raw odds are also discussed.	['Yinghong Zou', 'Ronald Tsz Hin Hung', 'Ka Fai Cedric Yiu']	175.0	arxiv		
191	Prediction Model for the Africa Cup of Nations 2019 via Nested Poisson Regression	Lorenz A. Gilch	2019-05-08 13:10:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03628v1	This article is devoted to the forecast of the Africa Cup of Nations 2019 football tournament. It is based on a Poisson regression model that includes the Elo points of the participating teams as covariates and incorporates differences of team-specific skills. The proposed model allows predictions in terms of probabilities in order to quantify the chances for each team to reach a certain stage of the tournament. Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the outcome of each single match of the tournament and hence to simulate the whole tournament itself. The model is fitted on all football games on neutral ground of the participating teams since 2010.	[]	176.0	arxiv		
192	A regularized hidden Markov model for analyzing the 'hot shoe' in football	Marius Ötting	2019-11-19 08:02:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08138v1	Although academic research on the 'hot hand' effect (in particular, in sports, especially in basketball) has been going on for more than 30 years, it still remains a central question in different areas of research whether such an effect exists. In this contribution, we investigate the potential occurrence of a 'hot shoe' effect for the performance of penalty takers in football based on data from the German Bundesliga. For this purpose, we consider hidden Markov models (HMMs) to model the (latent) forms of players. To further account for individual heterogeneity of the penalty taker as well as the opponent's goalkeeper, player-specific abilities are incorporated in the model formulation together with a LASSO penalty. Our results suggest states which can be tied to different forms of players, thus providing evidence for the hot shoe effect, and shed some light on exceptionally well-performing goalkeepers, which are of potential interest to managers and sports fans.

193	Forecasting football matches by predicting match statistics	Edward Wheatcroft	2020-01-24 17:05:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09097v1	This paper considers the use of observed and predicted match statistics as inputs to forecasts of the outcomes of football matches. It is shown that, were it possible to know the match statistics in advance, highly informative forecasts of the match outcome could be made. Whilst, in practice, match statistics are never available prior to the match, this leads to a simple philosophy. If match statistics can be predicted pre-match, and if those predictions are accurate enough, it follows that informative match forecasts can be made. It is shown that Generalised Attacking Performance (GAP) ratings, introduced in a recent paper, provide a suitable methodology for predicting match statistics in advance and that they are informative enough to provide information beyond that reflected in the odds. A long term and robust gambling profit is demonstrated when the forecasts are combined with two betting strategies.	[]	178.0	arxiv		
194	Investigating the efficiency of the Asian handicap football betting market with ratings and Bayesian networks	Anthony Constantinou	2020-03-10 09:50:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09384v2	Despite the massive popularity of the Asian Handicap (AH) football (soccer) betting market, its efficiency has not been adequately studied by the relevant literature. This paper combines rating systems with Bayesian networks and presents the first published model specifically developed for prediction and assessment of the efficiency of the AH betting market. The results are based on 13 English Premier League seasons and are compared to the traditional market, where the bets are for win, lose or draw. Different betting situations have been examined including a) both average and maximum (best available) market odds, b) all possible betting decision thresholds between predicted and published odds, c) optimisations for both return-on-investment and profit, and d) simple stake adjustments to investigate how the variance of returns changes when targeting equivalent profit in both traditional and AH markets. While the AH market is found to share the inefficiencies of the traditional market, the findings reveal both interesting differences as well as similarities between the two.	[]	179.0	arxiv		
195	Predicting play calls in the National Football League using hidden Markov models	Marius Ötting	2020-03-24 11:48:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10791v1	In recent years, data-driven approaches have become a popular tool in a variety of sports to gain an advantage by, e.g., analysing potential strategies of opponents. Whereas the availability of play-by-play or player tracking data in sports such as basketball and baseball has led to an increase of sports analytics studies, equivalent datasets for the National Football League (NFL) were not freely available for a long time. In this contribution, we consider a comprehensive play-by-play NFL dataset provided by www.kaggle.com, comprising 289,191 observations in total, to predict play calls in the NFL using hidden Markov models. The resulting out-of-sample prediction accuracy for the 2018 NFL season is 71.5%, which is substantially higher compared to similar studies on play call predictions in the NFL.	[]	180.0	arxiv		
196	Asymmetries in football: The pass-goal paradox	D. R. Antequera	2020-05-21 17:50:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10816v1	"We investigate the relation between the number of passes made by a football team and the number of goals. We analyze the 380 matches of a complete season of the Spanish national league ""LaLiga"" (2018/2019). We observe how the number of scored goals is positively correlated with the number of passes made by a team. In this way, teams on the top (bottom) of the ranking at the end of the season make more (less) passes than the rest of the teams. However, we observe a strong asymmetry when the analysis is made depending on the part of the match. Interestingly, fewer passes are made on the second part of a match while, at the same time, more goals are scored. This paradox appears in the majority of teams, and it is independent of the number of passes made. These results confirm that goals in the first part of matches are more ""costly"" in terms of passes than those scored on second halves."	['D. Garrido', 'I. Echegoyen', 'R. Lopez del Campo', 'R.

197	Planning to Score a Goal in Robotic Football with Heuristic Search	Ivan Khokhlov	2020-08-03 12:56:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00851v2	This paper considers a problem of planning an attack in robotic football (RoboCup). The problem is reduced to finding a trajectory of the ball from its current position to the opponents goals. Heuristic search algorithm, i.e. A*, is used to find such a trajectory. For this algorithm to be applicable we introduce a discretized model of the environment, i.e. a graph, as well as the core search components: cost function and heuristic function. Both are designed to take into account all the available information of the game state. We extensively evaluate the suggested approach in simulation comparing it to a range of baselines. The result of the conducted evaluation clearly shows the benefit of utilizing heuristic search within the RoboCup context.	['Vladimir Litvinenko', 'Ilya Ryakin', 'Konstantin Yakovlev']	182.0	arxiv		
198	Wisdom of the crowds forecasting the 2018 FIFA Men's World Cup	Marco Henrique de Almeida Inácio	2020-08-29 16:23:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13005v1	The FIFA Men's World Cup Tournament (WCT) is the most important football (soccer) competition, attracting worldwide attention. A popular practice among football fans in Brazil is to organize contests in which each participant informs guesses on the final score of each match. The participants are then ranked according to some scoring rule. Inspired by these contests, we created a website to hold an online contest, in which participants were asked for their probabilities on the outcomes of upcoming matches of the WCT. After each round of the tournament, the ranking of all users based on a proper scoring rule were published. This paper studies the performance of some methods intended to extract the wisdom of the crowds, which are aggregated forecasts that uses some or all of the forecasts available. The later methods are compared to simpler forecasting strategies as well as to statistical prediction models. Our findings corroborate the hypothesis that, at least for sporting events, the wisdom of the crowds offers a competitive forecasting strategy. Specifically, some of these strategies were able to achieve high scores in our contest.

199	ARENA: A Data-driven Radio Access Networks Analysis of Football Events	Lanfranco Zanzi	2020-10-19 13:09:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09467v1	Mass events represent one of the most challenging scenarios for mobile networks because, although their date and time are usually known in advance, the actual demand for resources is difficult to predict due to its dependency on many different factors. Based on data provided by a major European carrier during mass events in a football stadium comprising up to 30.000 people, 16 base station sectors and $1$Km$^2$ area, we performed a data-driven analysis of the radio access network infrastructure dynamics during such events. Given the insights obtained from the analysis, we developed ARENA, a model-free deep learning Radio Access Network (RAN) capacity forecasting solution that, taking as input past network monitoring data and events context information, provides guidance to mobile operators on the expected RAN capacity needed during a future event. Our results, validated against real events contained in the dataset, illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution.
