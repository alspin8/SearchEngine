2	Need help with finding my position	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-09 14:52:27	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/192ggeu/need_help_with_finding_my_position/	Hi guys! Could you help me find my positions based on my strengths and weaknesses? Any help will be appreciated. I usually play as center-back (decently strong ok at height at 176 cm or 5'9), but I'm kinda getting tired of it. So, in my opinion, my strengths are: Quite fast (when dribbling I usually kick the ball on and chase after it), high stamina, used to be a crazy slide tackler (trying to quit that), can dribble (on a good day) and when given space I usually do very well, creating lots of chances and getting shots on target, can body people, decently powerful shot from range (let's not talk about accuracy) and sometimes I can make a few good runs Oh god here comes, weaknesses: COMPOSURE and decision making (have this inability to retain possession when pressed, and with the usually small school pitches, I am constantly under a lot of pressure, causing me to make many crucial mistakes), quite a few fouls, passing, usually dribbling, finishing under pressure (again the first 2) So I'm thinking to train myself to become better at shooting and dribbling to become a striker (there is a lot of competition in defence and don't think I'll ever be competent enough in midfield). Any suggestions on which position I should play or how to improve my weaknesses?	9.0	t3_192ggeu	reddit

It's been ""rumoured' that he doesn't actually coach the players. Only does the man management etc etc Similar with Gerrard with Beale as his coach. To me it seems crazy because how the hell do you know if some dudes a snake oil salesman without knowing whats BS and whats not by excelling at the role yourself? Am not saying he can't ever only focus on man management but at some point you gotta be able to deal with coaching side if needs be.

5	Question about offside rule and the 2022 WC Final	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-09 03:55:53	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1925dap/question_about_offside_rule_and_the_2022_wc_final/	Was looking at a video of Kolo Muani's last minute shot which Dibu miraculously saved in the 2022 World Cup Final and there's another French player (Mbappe I think) to the left of him who is in an offside position the moment that the pass (which is quite long) is made. Muani himself is clearly onside but I'm curious if he had scored it would have been disallowed because of the other player, given that had the ball been kicked just slightly to the left he would have been the recipient. Is an offside called only when a player receives it? Or can it be called the moment the passing player kicks? In which case there would have been no way of knowing which of the two players would have received it. Here's a good video of the play in slow mo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muPvADrwSYo&ab\_channel=LAMPUALADINIDX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muPvADrwSYo&ab_channel=LAMPUALADINIDX)	3.0	t3_1925dap	reddit

8	Football revolutionary’s, who has made the biggest impact on the way we play football in your lifetime?	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-08 23:01:19	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/191ywf9/football_revolutionarys_who_has_made_the_biggest/	With the passing of Daz Kaiser today can you think of any other players who influenced the game so much that it much as BeckenBuaer’s style of defending. In my lifetime I have seen many changes in the way teams line up but in my opinion nobody has had such an impact on the modern game as Claude Makalele, he made defensive midfielders as a must have in any good team from the 2000s. Never gave the ball away, didn’t try anything flash and barely crossed the halfway line, giving the more creative midfielders space and time to pick a pass, mopped up any loose balls or mistakes by teammates and allowing the full backs to bomb forwards knowing they were covered. He did all this and made it look easy. In the words of the famous zidane when asked about Real Madrids decision to sell him to Chelsea in order to accommodate David Beckham “ why put another layer of gold paint on the Bentley, when you are losing the entire engine” Does anybody have other examples of players who have totally changed the way we think about the modern game ?	4.0	t3_191ywf9	reddit		
9	Neymar didn’t make a mistake leaving Barcelona, his mistake was going to PSG	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-07 23:02:13	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1915g41/neymar_didnt_make_a_mistake_leaving_barcelona_his/	Contrary to popular opinion, I don’t believe Neymar made a mistake leaving Barcelona where I believe he did need to leave if he ever wanted a chance to win the Ballon D’or as unselfish as Messi is Neymar would never win a Ballon D’or in Barcelona as Messi would always be the main guy even if you think he was going to take a backseat. Messi is so good that he can still be the best player with necessarily contributing to goals at much and combine that with the fact that Messi is everything to Barcelona and although Neymar is loved very much in Barcelona it’s not even close to what Messi means to Barcelona so in that sense I think he had to leave. His mistake in my opinion was going to PSG because in the grand scheme of things it just don’t workout. He goes to Paris and pairs up with Mbappe in Ligue 1 which is already highly disrespected as a lower league and although I don’t think this is the main factor as they’ve been to a final and semi final in UCL I do think it’s a factor nonetheless. I think it worked out in the beginning since most people tend to neglect this but I believe his beginning years in PSG were PEAK Neymar as all the stats back up the claim that he was at his peak his first few seasons in Paris. It started off well but then injuries became a recurring theme and Mbappe started to get better and better and dice he was French, automatically became the star and main guy of the club. Then ultimately later on one of his greatest friends Messi came along which overshadowed even more, which was one of the whole points of him leaving in the first place.(that and money) I think Neymar had golden opportunities to win Ballon D’or in PSG especially if he brought Paris their first UCL especially in 2021 (cancelled Ballon D’or in 2020) but ultimately came up short mostly due to injuries imo.( and also Neymar was severely mistreated but those terrible PSG fans while in Paris, and Messi and Ronaldo never really declined at the time for Neymar to have a fair shot at the Ballon D’or) I think it was a good idea for him to leave Barcelona in terms of individual success but terrible to go to PSG. What do you guys think? Should he have stayed? I here could he have gone besides PSG?	56.0	t3_1915g41	reddit		
10	2008-2012 Barcelona Diamond Midfield (Busquets, Xavi, Iniesta, Messi)	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-08 18:04:31	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/191rhh4/20082012_barcelona_diamond_midfield_busquets_xavi/	Were those 4 players above really the only players that mattered in that 2008-2012 pep team? I mean... you could rotate any other player outside those 4 players with other players and pep's Barcelona would still be the Goat team. No way any other team in history could out dominate that midfield diamond in their prime. All 4 of these players goat psychopathic levels of composure and calmness. I'm just picturing being a striker, winger, left back, right back, goalie, and CB's having this as my midfield: Messi Xavi Iniesta Busquets It just seems like a joke playing with this... you could pass the ball to any of these 4 players in tight situations and they'd retain possession easily. making your life way easier as a teammate.	3.0	t3_191rhh4	reddit

12	What is with people “gatekeeping” footballers?	Unknown	2024-01-09 01:08:55	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1921u7t/what_is_with_people_gatekeeping_footballers/	Posting about this amidst the recent Beckenbauer news (rest in peace). With a lot of friends my age (19) talking about him as a footballer, there are many who are being critical and saying we can’t comment on (or even appreciate) players like him because we weren’t alive to watch them. This discussion has also come up with the likes of Maradona within the goat debate, with people saying we (young people) can’t include him in the debate “because you never watched him”. To this degree I feel like older football fans are “gate keeping” the footballers they grew up with, which I think is against the spirit of the game. As a football fan, regardless of age, I believe it is my right to be a fan of all football history that is accessible to me, especially in today’s day and age with platforms like YouTube on our hands.

16	Top 10 Caribbean Leagues (In my Opinion)	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-08 21:06:56	https://i.redd.it/synrb6y27abc1.jpeg	"1.🇹🇹 Trinidad and Tobago: This one, was kinda tricky, it""s hard to decide between them and haiti, because both of them have a relatevely good league and both won x2 the ""Concachampions"". But i decided on Trinidad, because of the International Stage. Trinidad has 7 more Caribbean Championships and also 9 more Sub-championships than Haitian Clubs. The only way Haiti beats Trinidad, is in having more high ranked clubs in the concacaf club rankings, and that's it. 2. 🇭🇹 Haiti: The 2nd best league behind Trinidad, they have 2 Concachampions, 2 Caribbean championships, and the gran majority of teams in the concacaf club rankings. 3. 🇯🇲Jamaica: If it wasnt for their lack of Concachampionship (they dont have a single one), they would be 2nd place. Because in the international caribbean competitions, Jamaica clearly surpass Haiti. Having won 4 Caribbean championships, and having 4 2nd places (sub-championships). They also are the league with more teams on the concacaf club rankings after haiti, and the league with more high-ranking teams in the FDB. So yeah, that lack of continental champions is the only thing keeping them from being 2nd or 1st. 4. 🇸🇷 Surinam Their league dont appear neither in the concacaf ranking nor in the FDB. But they are still better than RD. And that's because of their 2 best teams. SV Transvaal and Robinhood. Who have done a lot in the international stage. They have won 2 concacaf champions cup, 2 caribbean shields, the first edition of the caribbean cup and they also have a lot of 2nd places. Surpassing RD by a lot. 5. 🇩🇴Republica Dominicana Even though they lack international trophies, they still won 2 Caribbean championships, one 2nd place, a Caribbean cup 3rd place and also, the bigger amount of teams in the concacaf rankings after haiti and jamaica. And also, they have a professional league. Sth that only them, jamaica, haiti and trinidad have. Almost of all the caribbean leagues are amateur So yeah. RD 5th place 6. 🇲🇶 Martinica They have won 2 Caribbean shields, and have at least one team on the concacaf ranking. It's not more than Puerto Rico, but the difference comes in the league. Martinica had a lot more consistent league than them. Having played it since 19xx, while puerto rico's began in 2015. In summary, they have more history. 7. 🇵🇷 P. Rico This is the last big league of the caribe. Having won 2 Caribbean championships and 1 Caribbean Shield Cup. They have more international prowess than martinica, but the lack of a decent league really hurts them. Their biggest team has only won 4 puerto rican leagues....yeah.... 8. 🇨🇼 Curazao They're here thanks to their domestic league. Being the most consistent one, having almost played every year. And even tho they dont have international cups, they had 3rds places here and there. Being the thing that separate thems from the majority of the caribbean leagues 9. 🇬🇵 Guadeloupe The same case as curazao, 1 caribbean championship 3rd and a better league in terms of teams and international aparitions. 10. 🇧🇧 Barbados The reason why i put them, and not antigua and barbuda. Is because even tho antigua had like 10 international aparitions, they have never reached the semifinals And barbados with only 3, made it. Also because i think barbados teams in general are better at the game than antigua teams. But, antigua could easily be Top 10 also, this is just my interpretation.

32	Question for my fellow Germans: How import is to you (an to your country) the 7-1 against Brasil?	:APL:Argentina	2024-01-06 21:20:25	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/190ai1z/question_for_my_fellow_germans_how_import_is_to/	I know that for Brazilians it's a big deal, like, the 7-1 has became a whole thing by its own and in terms of football there has been many changes in how people see the National Team after that (at least that’s what I can get from r/futebol, if any Brazilian wants to give a better insight on this, you're more than welcome). But now I want to know what meant and means to the Germans. I think that winning 7-1 in a WC semifinal to Brazil in their country will be almost the very best thing for my nation (only second to the fact itself of ***winning the World Cup***), but I'm biased because I'm Argentinian and we have a special beef as *bromance/frenemies* with them. So, what it means to you? As an example, would you preferred to have won that semifinal by a common margin (like 2-1) but then having not-awful performances in the following WCs (like advancing up until QF or SF instad of getting knocked out in GS)?	10.0	t3_190ai1z	reddit

34	Why do you support big European clubs and not clubs from your country or local ones?	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-07 07:45:10	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/190mzt6/why_do_you_support_big_european_clubs_and_not/	This question is for all the fans of big European clubs which live relatively far away from their favurite club. What football means to you? Is it watching on tv the best of the best play the game and cheering for one of these mega clubs? Or is it going to stadiums, cheering with other people around you together on the stands, sharing emotions, positive and negative, with all those fans around you united by one thing - love for your club. Going with your friends to away games and cheering even louder for your club so eventhough you are greatly outnumbered , you are heard throughout the stadium, pushing your team forward. Is it the stoppage time winner and complete ecstasy of you and everyone around you, kissing and hugging complete strangers, yet strangers united by this one loce and passion for your club, no matter how shitty they play compared to Barca, Real..... For me that's the real point of football, and I think so much of you guys are missing out on it, supporting a big and rich megaclub thousands of kilometers away, while your local team probably can't fill the stadium, and people like you are disconnected from a club which is a part of your community, your identity. Remember thatylu watching on tv Mbappe signing for your Real and scoring in final of cl to beat Barca cannot even compare to a feeling of joy and ecstasy when your club scores a winner in the last seconds against your bitter rivals and everyone goes nuts, be it in first or fourth division. Nothing can match that feeling. No one is saying that you can't still symphatize Barca, Real, Milan, Liverpool,.... but the amount of passion and love which can only be given to one club should be the one which is the part of your community, your collective identity. Club which you will support on the stadium whenever you can. I know this post is just wishfull thinking and that most of you will continue supporting these mega clubs, but if only 1 person I was able to convince to start attending football matches and stop the mindless support of big corporative clubs (which are the cancer of modern football, dominating and bullying all the other clubs and making modern football extremely boring and corrupt - all the money shared by 15/20 big clubs and no club outside can challenge them) I will regard it as a victory.	20.0	t3_190mzt6	reddit

36	Is there any way for smaller clubs to ever have a chance to truly compete in world football?	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-06 14:44:47	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1901gwb/is_there_any_way_for_smaller_clubs_to_ever_have_a/	I’ll use top 5 for example, we all know the top leagues are dominated as the following: Premier League- Big 6 La Liga- 2 teams and once in a while 3 teams Serie A- Big 6 like Prem Bundesliga- 1 team Ligue 1- 1 team That’s why I think it’d be good for clubs like Girona, Aston Villa, and Bayer Leverkusen to win there leagues as it changes the usual and predictable norm of the same teams winning their league. This could as set a precedent for football as a whole to become more competitive in the future. FFP has been absolutely AWFUL and I think a salary cap wouldn’t work as that would hinder smaller clubs due due the cap in spending. Would a luxury tax work? You break FFP or if you have a salary cap and go over the cap you pay back the league and the league redistributes the money to the rest of the clubs in the league. What do you guys think will smaller clubs ever consistently compete with bigger clubs in their leagues, in the UCL, and in world football as a whole?	19.0	t3_1901gwb	reddit

40	Why do English football fans like to diss Scottish football so much?	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-07 10:30:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/190pcib/why_do_english_football_fans_like_to_diss/	I saw the video of an English journalist asking Ange Postecoglou if he could 'visualise winning trophies' (as if none of his previous trophies counted) and then read the comments, which were filled with people dissing Scottish football, so I wondered why a lot of English football fans feel the need to do this. Obviously everyone is entitled to their opinion, but us Scottish fans know the standard isn't as good as the English Premier League, but we don't care, so what do you get out of telling us so? It's like a kid born into a rich family who goes to Eton slagging off a kid who goes to public school for not getting the same standard of education. Do you not realise how elitist it sounds? The thing is though, apart from Liverpool and Man Utd, most of your clubs would struggle to even finish 3rd in Scotland (if you had the same budgets as us, of course). Here's a few facts about our 'famers' league': - Scotland has the highest attendances in Europe per capita. - Ibrox holds the record for the largest league attendance in Britain. - Ibrox and Celtic Park were voted 1st and 2nd out of 100 by Four Four Two magazine for the best stadiums in Britain. - Hampden holds the record for the largest international attendance in Britain. - The highest UEFA club attendance ever was at Hampden. - In the last 4 seasons Scottish clubs have beaten: Porto, Galatasaray, Dortmund, Feyenoord, Lazio, Leipzig, PSV, Betis, AZ Alkmaar, Red Star, Braga, Rennes, Frankfurt, and Rosenborg (a list that most English teams would be proud of). I'm not slagging English football, I'm sure most Scots support the British clubs in Europe, but the next time you think your 'nan could win the league in Scotland', please give us a break and remember many English players and managers (as well as other top internationals) have come up here and either struggled or failed completely. Also, we've all seen the videos of the crap atmospheres at Anfield, Old Trafford, Tottenham and Man City lately, and at least we still don't have half 'n' half scarves for tourists, and most of us are glad our clubs haven't sold out to oil money and the Super League. Please don't take this as anti-English or any of that pish, I'm just trying to highlight how much of a bratty Eton schoolboy you sound when you feel the need to tell us how bad our game is. We already know and we don't care what you think about it. 👍🤣	52.0	t3_190pcib	reddit

Bayern will never sanction a move for him, and I don't think Mbappe wants to go from one horse league to another. 2. Barca are broke, Atletico are not prestigious enough. 3. Serie A clubs like Juve, Inter, Milan also do not posses the financial muscle to afford him. 4. That leaves the PL clubs, among which United/Chelsea are too shit for him to consider, City has his rival Haaland playing, Arsenal has FFP issues, Spurs/Newcastle are not gonna entice him and that leaves only Liverpool! So its either moving to Madrid, staying at PSG or coming to Liverpool: 1. Scenario - stays at PSG: He's reaching the ceiling of his potential to grow in Ligue 1 away from worldwide attention and he needs to move in order to evolve as well as start increasing his legacy as a player if he truly wants to contend for one of the greatest players of all-time. 2. Scenario - comes to Liverpool: He will play in the most popular league in the world, with his rival Haaland against him for another title winning side of Man City, its the perfect blockbuster. --- Now comes the nightmare final scenario - Goes to Real Madrid: This is the last straw that will break things apart. If he goes there, then there is no side stopping Madrid to completely decimate the Europe for a decade to come. Real Madrid will have these players under their disposal if things go according to plan: - Mbappe (25) - Vini (23) - Rodrygo (23) - Endrick (17) - Bellingham (20) - Guler (18) - Valverde (25) - Tchouameni (23) - Camavinga (20) - Militao (25) - Davies (23) ? - Yoro (18) ? How is anyone in their wildest dream can compete against this monster team that will all come in their prime together while gelling on chemistry for decade to come? It will ruin the Champions League forever to Mercedes F1 levels. Mbappe, has to come to Liverpool.	32.0	t3_18zvhji	reddit

Europa League: Villarreal 13p (1), Real Betis 9p (3). EDIT: I stand corrected. Completely missed Sevilla. Honestly I was looking at the CL table and after counting four Spanish teams I stopped looking for more. Never thought about the situation they could have five teams in the CL. Damn. My bad.

61	Willian had the skillset, athleticism and work ethic to be a superstar but his decision making and game intelligence let him down so much.	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-04 04:09:30	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18y3uhg/willian_had_the_skillset_athleticism_and_work/	His talent work ethic and physical attributes are a major reason why he's still decent in the premier league at am advanced age. He was rapid, could stop and start on a dime, accelerated from a stop almost faster than anyone else I've seen, press resistant, great ball striking, good range of passing, high work rate but unfortunately he was just horrible at decision making and had mediocre in game intelligence. In his prime at chelsea he constantly constantly messed up counter attacks, had a very poor sense of positioning and making off ball runs, and despite being good at ball striking and having a great passing range lacked the vision to be a consistent creative outlet. This is one of the reasons why fans of other teams think he used to be great and chelsea fans used to not like him as much. He was genuinely skilled and super talented, just not the smartest guy on the pitch.	7.0	t3_18y3uhg	reddit

90	Eric Dier - what next for him?	Unknown	2023-12-29 16:06:37	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18tqirh/eric_dier_what_next_for_him/	As the title suggests. I wondered where people thought he may go next really. Thinking about what he offers - pretty much can only play in the centre of a three or possibly defensive midfield, which maybe means Italy or lower half prem teams, but none really play a back 3 in the prem atm. In terms of what he offers, you get a player with great leadership, really nice distribution short or long. Aerial ability perfectly decent but not a strong one on one tackler. On the downside I'm not sure how press resistant he is, he's slow which will be an issue to any team attempting a high line, and if he were to be moved into midfield it's a long time since he's played there so very much an unproven quantity. Can he do the stones style role of playing in a 4 and tucking in as part of a double pivot in possession? I'm not sure what his potential is picking up the ball on the half turn, and equally not sure he can still be a decent 6. I'm interested to know people's thoughts. I think he's got a lot of talent but maybe not specific traits that suit the modern game? The only top side in the prem playing a low block counter attack style that would suit him are united, and that would be a hugely long shot move. I'd be intrigued to know if he could play as a single pivot in a 433 but it's a long shot. What does everyone think?	1.0	t3_18tqirh	reddit

The amount of Multi-Club groups has grown at an accelerated pace the last few years, yet none of them seem to have some real differentiators apart from their ownership structure. Take City Football Group for example. Sure, they may have some of the current top Clubs around the world, like Manchester City and Girona, but the only real differentiator from other groups seems to be that they are owned by Abu Dhabi. My question is, do you think that there are any real differentiators to these groups? Is there any of them that actually justifies their existence by having something in their methodology that is doing things differently? What could potentially be a unique selling proposition from any of these groups, apart of the money that they offer to their previous owners?

99	Why don't we have a ratio of individual goals scored/team goals scored	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-27 12:43:28	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18rzvgu/why_dont_we_have_a_ratio_of_individual_goals/	"When we have discussion about players we always have raw stats (total of goals, assists and at best goals/assists per game, but i think it will be better to have goals/assists per minutes played) but we never have a ratio vs team goals scored. Some players really benefits from their teams style of play (Haaland for Man City for instance) but others don't (Hazard during his Chelsea time with a very defensive side). With expected goals/assists it kind of balance this problem but does not account for other factors. Example, if you play with Salah at Liverpool you know you will have more space because defenders will focus on him, even if they are far, they will keep an eye on him. Another exemple, if you play with very aggressive and technical players, you will have more penalties given to you and it increases your goals scored amount. So a bit of a controversial take to finish but if we take Messi and Ronaldo, I think that they had massively benefit, in terms of stats, from their superteam goal scoring machine but we never take that into account. Messi for Argentina : 0,58 goals per game VS Messi for Barcelona : 0,86 goals Ronaldo for Portugal : 0,62 goals per game Vs Ronaldo for Real Madrid : 1,03 goals per game Vs Ronaldo for Juventus : 0,75 goals per game Hazard for Chelsea : 0,31 goal per game (but to be fair he has also 0,26 assists per game) Torres for a defensive Liverpool Benitez side : 0,57 goals per game (just needed another exemple) We can see that it makes a huge difference, if we can have a ratio it will balance things out and helps us make better comparaison, some players stats are really helped by their teams offensive tactic, the players they play with, where they play (it is easier to score in Bundesliga), etc. I hope one day that we will have more context on stats in football, it really feels ""cheap"" and ""childish"" sometimes."	3.0	t3_18rzvgu	reddit

Vinicius Junior in 2018, Rodrygo in 2019, Eder Militao in 2019. Renier Jesus in 2020. And Endrick in 2022. The get all of these players before they become established stars and some like Vini and Rodrygo before Europe even. And the seeds gave fruit. Vini is now the world’s best winger and only cost €45 million. Rodrygo is a prolific and performing right winger and only cost €40 million. Eder Militao is a top 5 world center back and only cost like €50 million. Renier Jesus flopped hard and Endrick is yet to prove himself, but these investments have shown to have lots of worth. They were big factors in guiding Madrid to another UCL. Brazil + Real Madrid is becoming a brand. Is Man City trying this with Argentines? They signed Alvarez last year and he’s been performing brilliantly for them, he’s very similar to Rodrygo. They signed Perrone who is developing and have now signed Everechhi a highly talented wonder kid from Boca. They are also thinking of signing Barco. Do you guys think Man City is trying to build a reputation in a Football hotbed like Argentina (like how Real Madrid did in Brazil?) after all Alvarez said that it was the positive history of Argentines in man city like aguero and Zabaletta that lead him to choose them. What do you guys think? Man City and Real Madrid are the 2 best clubs in the world right now, and seem to have the market for 2 of footballs’s greatest hotbeds in the continent of South America.

The minute of silence for the death of the greatest football player of all time, in an empty stadium really gave me this feeling of ""it's over"".

Juventus, Milan, Barcelona, Man United, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Liverpool, for god's sake even Paris Saint Germain, all of them have been falling and falling, losing players, appeal, tradition, fans. The Messi and Ronaldo's era was quite long, and probably destroyed many other players in the meanwhile, but they were part of a larger design, they played against and with the likes of Nesta, Maldini, Scholes, Keane, Giggs, Ronaldinho, Cannavaro, Del Piero, Totti, Buffon and so on, leaving a permanent mark. The class of 90s has been quite disappointing and no one has really replaced the old legends, leaving a generational void. The super league, the downward spiral of certain domestic championships, the diminishing importance of the Champions League and the increase of black swans events like multiple balloon d'ors winners, repeted consecutive champions league winners, legends leaving their historical clubs or joining rivals or playing in Arabia for money, no players actually caring about glory, alongside the disillusion and diminishing cultural importance of the sport (younger generations care more about Fortnite thsn football) and the lack of personality by football figures have destroyed the beauty of this game.

104	Rodri is not as good as people claim he is	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-28 10:36:48	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18sqzu3/rodri_is_not_as_good_as_people_claim_he_is/	Before y'all down vote and comment to tell me I'm the dumbest mfer alive, hear me out. Rodri is undeniably a world class player. His ability to retain the ball is amazing. He can cope with being left all alone in midfield... Against weaker teams. Which is impressive, don't get me wrong. You can't expect a midfielder to hold the entire midfield of a top team alone. But here is my first problem with what people claim of Rodri. People pretend that Rodri single handedly bosses the midfield against top teams. And sure, he might have 1 game once in a while where he does that. Great players have great moments. But that does *not* mean he is capable of regularly doing that. In my opinion, no one is capable of regularly bossing a midfield around by themselves. Yet, mostly city fans to be fair, have been claiming this for a while and I'm getting quite tired of seeing it. No, Rodri vs the entire Arsenal midfield isn't going to win. He's not THAT good. My second complaint about what people say about Rodri is that he's better than Haaland or De Bruyne because City can win without either of them, but not without Rodri. And I'm sorry, but that's a non sequitur argument. A non sequitur argument is an argument where the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. Rodri being more important to that City team is the logical conclusion. Now you can argue that him being more important makes him better, but that I would disagree with also. I think Rodri is more important because of Pep's system requiring a DM, but they only have Rodri. Let me elaborate on that before you try to call me stupid though. Who do Manchester City have when Grealish is out? Doku and Foden. Who do City have when Haaland is out? Alvarez, potentially the third best striker in the world. Who do they have when Bernardo Silva is out? Again, Foden can play that position. Who do City have when Nunes or Kovacic are out? They have Rico Lewis. Who do Manchester City have to control the attack? When he's not injured, De Bruyne. Arguably the best creative midfielder in the world right now. Now don't get me wrong, not all players I have named are worldclass. But you would all agree with me if I said they are good enough at what they do to fall in, right? But who do City have as back up for Rodri? Philips... Kelvin Philips. So I really, truly, must beg the question whether Rodri is as important to City as he is because he's on level with Lothar Matthaus (I've seen some idiot actually claim this) or if it's because City have no back up DM. In my opinion, it's the latter. Again, Rodri is worldclass, but he's NOT the best player in the world. And no, him being more important for City than Haaland, when City have the third best striker in the world coming off the bench, is not a great argument for why he's *better*.	38.0	t3_18sqzu3	reddit

Unknown	2023-12-25 06:08:33	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18qcsnj/why_arent_there_more_top_goalkeepers_who_become/	"reasons why it feels like there should be more - 1 they're usually directing the players in defensive situations. 2 they get to see attacks from a vantage point that nobody else gets, which could teach them just as much about how to attack as it does for how to defend. 3 being exceptionally athletic is less of a requirement: it's rare to be tall+fast+strong+energy efficient. and it's rare to be intelligent. but it should be more difficult for top outfield players to become top managers as being athletic *and* intelligent is *really* rare. 4 unlike great forwards, they might be less frustrated as they can't just ""go in and do it themselves"", probably useful experience to have as a manager who needs to stand on the touch line for 90 minutes (ex: henry, but put your pitchforks down I'm an arsenal fan). one possible reason base rate fallacy (# of outfield players > # of goalkeepers in absolute numbers), but I'm specifically talking about top goalkeepers vs top outflelders and those numbers should be much closer. tldr why were none of bald fraud the first, gegengrinning, lego man and the other bald fraud goalkeepers when all of the coke gods and les henries forwards"	28.0	t3_18qcsnj	reddit

113	Why is Central America so bad at football	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-24 18:49:53	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18q18ne/why_is_central_america_so_bad_at_football/	Latin America is usually considered to be the most talented and football-obsessed region in the world, and while most of the attention is usually on South America, many people associate Central America with them. However, South America has many world cups, and is competitive on a national and league level. However, in CONCACAF Central America has 0 gold cups. Jamaica's been to 2 Gold cup Finals, winning none which is about the same as Central American nations. However, in the Caribbean, there are more popular sports such as Cricket and Athletics, in Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic Baseball is bigger. Mexico and USA dominate the Gold Cup and while Mexico is understandable, Football is only the 4th or 5th most popular sport in the USA, even Canada has 1 Gold Cup and hockey is the biggest sport there. On a Club level, they do not fare much better, with Mexico and USA dominating and Caribbean countries having a similar level of success as Central America except Costa Rica, which falls behind the USA and Mexico. I really do not understand why this happens, every reason I can think of also applies to many South American and other countries. for example, one could say Central American countries are poor and corrupt, but this is also the case in South America where football is arguably played at the highest average level &#x200B; The small population size can be blamed as Central America can be dwarfed in comparison to USA, Mexico and even Canada. However, this does not stop South America where the 2 largest countries are Brazil (by miles) and Argentina. However, Uruguay with about 2% of Brazils population has more Copa Americas and won the World Cup twice (was world champions 4 times). Furthermore, in the Copa America and club level all countries in South America are relatively competitive in CONMEBOL despite the population disparity, as all except for one have won the Copa America. Also as stated before, Caribbean countries have a similar population, on average less actually and this small population competes for bigger sports (in my country cricket). but play at a similar level to Central American nations in CONCACAF. To an extent, this population disparity exists in every region, but aside from Oceania when Australia was still in it, none are dominated by one country &#x200B; Maybe its because the domestic leagues are poor in comparison to South America and Europe, this may be true, as I heard in Central America professional leagues are not very developed, but they are much more developed compared to the Caribbean, in many of these countries teams don't have proper stadiums or even broadcasting, but still have similar levels of success in the CONCACAF champions league compared to Central America, except for Costa Rica as stated before. So while a lack of good leagues to develop players is a factor, it is a problem that is worse in other CONCACAF countries &#x200B; so please help me understand, why is Central America so bad at football despite being a nation where football is popular. in a region which is usually talented. By the way, no hate is intended, I still believe Central America is slightly better on average than the Caribbean but the reason I am making this is because I used to think Central America was on Par with Mexico and South American nations, but that is not the case.	63.0	t3_18q18ne	reddit

I feel as if puttimg him in a position where there isn't so much pressure on him to shoot rather than to make play could very well make his performance skyrocket. Looking back at a Joelinton heatmap circa 2019, we could see some form of echo between his performance and Højlund. Seeing as Højlund tends to make fast runs at the ball into the box and taking advantages of loose balls, considering a more playmaking CAM position could be a good call for ten Hag's Man United, which can take advantage of his spearing runs as well as his offensive awareness while easing some of the pressure for him to shoot and giving him more of an incentive to pass. This is just an opinion of mine, so please tell me what you think.	1.0	t3_18qfpp1	reddit

MetLife is accessible via public transport. Probably the best option, but it could have a weather issue due to it not having climate control in case of an emergency. Also time zones could mess with Europe, plus it isn’t central. Edit: nyc is no longer world’s capital Los Angeles, America’s 2nd biggest metro area and also very prevalent. Great football scene. SoFi is amazing, but isn’t mainly for soccer and that issue is still there. Probably would the be nearly the best venue but time zones once again could mess with TV viewership in optimizing this game for Europe means kick off will need to be at peak daytime which would be awful for the players. Dallas: least prevalent city of the 3, but has the biggest stadium in terms of capacity. Also is central, has climate control in the stadium to avoid all weather issues, and has time zones which work to make it so the game’s optimized for Europe but also is at afternoon for kick off so the players can have good conditions. Also Jerry Jones really wants this so he might put forth something extra.

Often Nottingham Forest games (don't talk to me about today) as my brother works there, but I've also been to many London clubs since moving to uni (Chelsea, Charlton, Millwall) as well as some random matches here and there (Blackburn, Stoke). There's nothing I love more than the matchday experience. The emanance of anticipation in the town centre, adhering to a trail of eager fans marching in droves to the stadium. The congregation in the pub catching the end of the half 12 kick, refreshing the socials to get team news. The pre-match music, walkouts, chanting, and everything that follows. Being from the North, I naturally also have a huge soft spot for any stadium that does chips and gravy. I'm a simple man. Sitting down at half time with chips and gravy observing the details of the stadium against a rusted and weathered seat, the scarf and food warming me up from the bitter 4pm Winter cold. I love it all. However, I don't drive. Though I live in London for uni, that'll get me a lot of opportunities to go to many clubs, and there's also good transport links from the city which'll make any stadium South of Birmingham relatively easy to access. However, trains are so very expensive, even with a railcard, and tickets can also be over £25 even for League Two clubs nowadays, let alone the hundred or so pounds you're paying for Prem clubs through third parties. Does anyone have any tips on accessing cheap tickets, especially for Premier League clubs? And also any tips for travelling around the country on matchday etc. Thank you.	4.0	t3_18pjmpe	reddit

Drew 0-0 at home I know Barca fans say oh the ref in the first leg was terrible as well, it’s no where near the same. To de bunk that rubbish - Etoo offside was extremely tight + he missed, - The Messi handball penalty shout is never a penalty he’s about a yard away, - The Henry penalty shout is softer than all of the ones Chelsea had turned down -Ballack red card (2 yellows) it was 2009 he would most likely be sent off today but back then probably not. 2nd leg where to start. They got bullied to begin with 2nd best all game. - Both handballs are the most obvious penalties of all time, - Abidal should’ve been sent off earlier for taking out drogba last man (no penalty again) - Malouda clearly fouled inside the box not outside What are your guys opinions?	37.0	t3_18otbjs	reddit

And the ref decided to give direct red card over to Fenerbahce's best player Fred in 90+13. He gave ''he called me stupid'' as a reason in field. After match while he giving report of the match he wrote down that Fred called him ''fucking stupid ref''. But the ref Zorbay Kucuk has failed the FIFA's english test in 2022, also Fred is not fluent with English, he might talked in Portuguese on field. Fred said that he only said ''thats stupid foul''. After all that drama Fenerbahce decided to make and objection to the red card to be cancelled because theres a biggest derby match on 24th of December. Also Fenerbahce has won every match with Fred and lost 3 match while Fred was injured. Lip readers and players around Fred has said that Fred didnt say any bad word to the ref. He was trying to call out that foul was stupid not the ref. Also calling stupid is not near to the bad word too.

However, it wasn't till I was maybe in my early to mid-teens that I took a 'die-hard' interest in the sport. So 2013 would have been either just before or around the time I got into the sport properly. The concept of Wigan Athletic winning the FA Cup by today's standards is almost impossible (I mean no offense Wigan fans). I was wondering, for those who remember it well, was it as shocking to you and other fans that they won the whole thing or were a brilliant team that has seemingly just lost their way over the last decade? &#x200B; TL:DR - Was Wigan winning the 2013 FA Cup shocking?	6.0	t3_18ov02t	reddit

Obviously the dutch league is more watchable for locals, but in terms of outside interest and competing in Europe they havent been great. Even when they get a great team the players get sold quickly. Atleast PSG tries to build around French nationals. They do bring top players the ligue 1 which makes the league more relevant. I guess its not good for locals, but in terms of outside interest i'd say its overall better for the league to have a top teams. Without Bayern Munich I think the Bundesliga would have issues drawing outside interest. Unfortunately you always need that core top team to make a league interesting.	18.0	t3_18o0hes	reddit		
145	"Unpopular opinion: ""English tax"" is a myth"	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-23 10:57:44	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18p3bi9/unpopular_opinion_english_tax_is_a_myth/	"Before instantly going to the replies and hating, actually hear me out first. A lot of people have been complaining about market values and players being ""overvalued"" (English players specifically). I'm not really convinced that ""English tax"" is actually real, people seem to ignore the fact that basically every single English player that a big club payed an excessively high price for came from a bottom half premier league club. For example Maguire to man united - leicester knew they could trick a big club with a lot of money into paying too much money for a mid player like maguire, so they did it and it worked. Same with grealish to city. People ""value"" grealish at about 30-40M - you really think villa were gonna let go of their best player that easily? again, no, they were a bottom half club at the time and if they can get our hands on 100M then they were going to do it. Same thing for the price that thomas Frank values ivan toney at. This also only applies to some English players. Most English players like Rice, Saka, Bellingham, Kane, Trent, Maddison, Stones, etc. have completely fair prices. And to prove it's not based on nationality, look at chelsea paying 80M for wesley fofana, is that ""french tax""? no, but if fofana was english everyone would be saying ""english tax"". Same thing with antony to man united, matheus nunes to man city, nicolas pepe to arsenal, enzo and caicedo to chelsea and richarlison to tottenham. Not denying that the prices are inflated, but it's for a good reason, it's smart business from bottom half clubs. And to respond to the argument that premier league clubs can only have a certain amount of foreign players so English players are in higher demand, other top leagues have similar policies so it sort of cancels it out. People also compare premier league transfers involving English players to transfers from la liga and Serie A, which is dumb because every league has a completely different financial status and la liga/serie A etc generally have less money flying around than the premier league, which is why transfers in those leagues tend to be for less. Yes there might be a mediocre english player being bought for more than an elite serie A player but it's not because of nationality. Also pretty strange that English players are the only players targeted when most big transfers dont involve english players. You dont get people going around saying ""spanish tax"" or ""brazilian tax"". I think ""english tax"" is a way for people to hate on english players or a term used because people don't understand how the transfer market works.One other thing that confuses me is why people care so much about market values, and why people say genuinely stupid things like ""This is the REAL market value of this player"" or ""This guy is not playing at the same level of his market value"". People sometimes need to just accept that the premier league clubs make more money than clubs from other leagues. People also love blaming English football fans for it. I'm sorry that nobody wants to watch las palmas vs rayo vallecano or salernitana vs genoa, what do you want us to do about it? They also exaggerate the extent to which players are inflated. I've seen some genuinely insane takes that seem to be driven by jealousy rather than actual logic, e.g. ""Rice doesn't start for a top 6 Serie A side"" ""The real value of the English national team is about the same as Denmark"" (to give you an idea of how insane that first take is, Bologna's (top 6 serie A side rn) DM is a Scottish player who struggles to get called up to their national team and if he does he gets benched for McTominay. TLDR: English players are SLLIGHTLY inflated (not to the ridiculous extent that everyone says they are), and it's not because of nationality, it's because they play in the league with the highest financial status."	20.0	t3_18p3bi9	reddit

Getting rid of it completely may be a mistake. Keeping it in its current form is a mistake. Proposal 1: -Both managers get one VAR challenge per game (NBA style). Game officiated as normal. If the manager thinks the ref or linesman have made an error, they notify the 4th official to do a review. If the manager is correct, they keep their VAR challenge. If they challenge again and the manager is wrong, they lose their challenge, and one potential substitute. Solution 2 -Officials can use VAR 3 times in total per game. Self explanatory, any other potential officiating errors we live with. Potential upsides: If managers disagree with a call, use your challenge rather than complaining about decisions during the game / post match etc. Game flows better, less anxiety after a goal goes in. Revert back to “attacker gets the benefit of the doubt” (unless of course VAR are going to review the decision). Less red card decisions will be slowed down (hopefully), as tackles will be evaluated in real time (unless challenged by the manager / VAR). What do you lot think? Surely we can improve VAR without doing away with it completely.	20.0	t3_18oc3gb	reddit

It was by a heartbreaking defeat by Fortaleza at their home ground sealed their fate in the second tier. I was left in absolute disbelief although it was seen coming. Fans especially in Brazil were left in agony as Santos lost to a last-minute winner, relegating them to 17th place. The aftermath is what was honestly sad. The pitch, once a place of celebration, became a canvas of hurt and rage and outside was cars burning and gases being thrown around including the pitch. To comprehend the depth of this sadness, In 1912 on the sandy shores of Brazil Santos FC emerged. The club's golden era in the 1950s, led by the legendary Pelé, who led them to three consecutive Copa Libertadores titles. Through the 21st century, Santos fostered talents like Neymar and Rodrygo who went out to become big superstars. The 2023 season saw President Andres Rueda's questionable recruitment decisions and a staggering 21 signings, disrupting the team's cohesion. As Botafogo's collapse allowed Palmeiras to seize the title, Santos faced dire consequences. Despite their undeniable prestige, Santos is now in the depths of the second division, no longer among Brazil's biggest clubs. There was a glimmer of hope this year with Marcos Leonardo, a 20-year-old striker who was going crazy in the league. Yet, even his departure signifies the harsh financial struggles post-relegation. As Santos FC confronts Serie B challenges, I hope they will bounce back from this set-back and go back into Serie A like many clubs have done. What do you guys think?

This will create a divide in Europe between: - Super League: Madrid, Barca, Atletico, Sevilla, Villarreal, Milan, Inter, Napoli, Roma, Juventus and others - Champions League: City, Arsenal, Liverpool, United, Newscastle, Bayern, Dortmund, Leipzig, PSG, and others.

The European clubs that have qualified for this tournament so far are Real Madrid, Man City, Bayern, PSG, Inter, Porto, Benfica, and Chelsea. On the other hand, this tournament will only add to the already overloaded football calendar. It will be interesting to see if clubs actually prioritize the 2025 CWC when the time comes, but I guess that will depend on the size of the prize pool.

163	I gave up sports betting 3 years ago but Premier League gambling ads are starting to genuinely tempt me and I’m getting sick of it.	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-18 13:03:25	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18l86t5/i_gave_up_sports_betting_3_years_ago_but_premier/	For clarity I was never an addict who sunk hundreds into a bet, but I became someone who couldn’t watch a single match without sticking a fiver or a tenner down to enjoy it. I couldn’t even watch my own club without first checking the odds and I’d often bet money in my overdraft to try and get out of it. I gave it up in 2021 as gambling during COVID felt like the last straw and I wasn’t really enjoying football anymore, just the betting side of things. Also as an up front disclaimer, I think gambling is a bit of fun for most people and I have nothing against it as an activity. But recently I’ve started to get the itch again and it’s all stemming from how much gambling firms can back football media. For example, I’ve just put the first episode of the Obi Mikel podcast on and without 20 seconds they’re thanking a betting company. The same with the Peter Crouch Friday pod, as they read out the Paddy Power odds for each score they predict and then discuss them. I most likely won’t go back to sports betting but what worries me is that I only had a small gambling problem and I’m being sucked in by all this sponsorship and promotions. I can’t imagine what’s it’s like for those with huge betting addictions and being hit in the face with odds and promotions when you just want to enjoy some football media feels like advertising cigarettes to asthmatics. I know the Premier League is going to phase out gambling shirt sponsors and hopefully halftime odds but feels like companies are easily finding their way around that and making gambling easier to advertise than ever. Also “please gamble responsibly” shouldn’t absolve businesses of responsibility. Anyone else feeling the pressure building quietly these days?	26.0	t3_18l86t5	reddit

The world cup is special because its every four years, simple as that. If it was every year it would lose alot of its relevance. I started watching soccer in 2006, and back then the wc felt huge. Since then its slowly declined in terms of talent for whatever reason. It seems like club football has risen in that time period, which is why this is a good time to make a revamped club world cup. I honestly believe that as long as the prize money isnt a rip off then teams all over will take this very seriously. Small teams definetly do take the current CWC seriously, with the new format we will see European teams do the same im sure of it. The mere fact that its every 4 years will make it huge. Im genuinely upset that Liverpool will not be involved in it. I believe this will become a global spectacle and well see everybody talking about it. I think the oppurtunity for non European teams to show off their skills will get people excited. As an American ill be very excited to see Seatlle sounders represent the usa, and im sure people from other countries will be very excited to see their own nations represented. You just know that any time a European club gets knocked out by somebody itll be an earthquake of excitement. This is very good for the sport, itll help grow non European football leagues interest because itll feel more relevant to win these competitions that qualify you.	31.0	t3_18md897	reddit

I just joined here. When I watch Leverkusen play it seems they're smoothly gliding on the pitch. No one really cares about their position. They make instant decisions (passing, positioning) depending on what's happening around them. I believe this is called relationalism, where teams don't really follow a structured positioning system on the pitch. Usually when teams play like this for example Girona, Real Madrid they do have defensive problems to an extent. They find it hard to defend transitions because the moment they lose the ball, their players are all over the pitch. But Leverkusen looks defensively solid too. I mean sure there are teams that run in behind their defensive highline using long balls but they somehow don't allow opponent to penetrate them through vertical ground passes. I wonder how they keep their shape. Any explanation about it would be helpful. Thanks	8.0	t3_18kn2ap	reddit

While Haaland's goal-scoring prowess is evident with a remarkable goal-per-game ratio, Ferguson could one day potentially reach these heights. Analyzing data from recent matches, Ferguson has clearly shown ability that he has what it takes to not only be an excpetional goal scorer but also a playmaker. His agility and ball control statistics compare favorably with Haaland's, suggesting a potential avenue for exploiting defensive vulnerabilities. By introducing an element of unpredictability, Ferguson may create situations where statistical advantages alone cannot fully capture the complexity of his gameplay. Moreover, in terms of adaptability, Ferguson has showcased a diverse set of skills, making it difficult for opponents to anticipate his moves. While Haaland's consistency and goal-scoring records are formidable, Ferguson's potential to redefine strategies and play with a certain unpredictability could be a key factor in surpassing expectations in the long run. It's an unconventional perspective, but in the world of football surprises often come from those who dare to challenge the norm.

But lately, when talking about the last 5 years or so, it’s just felt dead and predictable to watch. Champions League is probably the best example to explain this. The format was never that bad, but the same teams would either end up in the same groups, or the big clubs are given super easy picks compared to the smaller teams. The fact that the last 5 winners in the competition alone have been HUGE clubs should speak levels on how dead the contest is. You know who’s likely to make it to the knockouts before the matches have even begun. And then we have the leagues. I used to participate in gatekeeping the Premier League being the greatest league in the world, but at this point it’s become a farmers league just like the Bundesliga and Ligue 1. We seem to have lost the exctiement of not knowing who will win the leagues. In the top 6, i’m almost willing to bet my life savings you know who will most likely win each league. Another HUGE pet peeve is the amount of dives i see in matches now. It’s become a normalised behaviour. It honestly boils my blood to watch players act like they got hit by a sniperrifle, rather than actually go for the goal. Lastly, the amount of stubborness coming from the refs. I can’t speak for any other league but the prem, cause that’s where i see it occur a lot more often. Refs make a mistake, and rather than owning up to it by apologising, they punish players, managers and other staff for complaining. I don’t get it. We’re told we cry too much when their mistakes have literally changed the outcome of not only matches, but results towards the end of the season.

Quite a few EPL pundits say that Scholes was the best midfielder they ever saw in the EPL or they at least say he was the superior out of the Gerrard, Lampard, Scholes debate. These opinions are echoed by many spectators too. My question is, if Scholes was so great, how did Gerrard get in the PFA TOTY 8 times and Scholes only twice in a 20 year career? My understanding of this award is that a union of football experts compiles a list of players who are eligible and then the other players in the league vote on which of those players make the Team. So it would seem that in real time, most of the players around Scholes did not think he merited a spot in that team more than twice in 19 seasons in a team that won 12 titles in that period, but Gerrard did on 8 occasions. Even his own team mates such as Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt and Darren Fletcher made the team in years Scholes didn't. Yet today, people seem to speak with such detail when they talk about how good Scholes was. ""He controlled games, he was a metronome, he found space, you couldn't get the ball off him, he was the best passer I've ever seen, a great goal scorer"" etc. So if people can remember such specific detail all these years later, where were the votes when it was all going down? Is Scholes' reputation a product of rose-tinted glasses or are awards like this flawed in some way? Or has Scholes quality simply undergone a healthy reevaluation and people finally appreciate him the way they should have before?"	87.0	t3_18jtzb9	reddit

Club World Cup is happening right, the tournament used to have a predecessor called the Intercontinental Cup and it was seen also as the highest achievement possible for a club in Brazil. I gotta say, Is kinda amazing that brazilian clubs value this title that most of the time Europeans do not care. It's just a friendly match but in here if you don't have a trophy of this tournament you are not considered a big club. THIS IS the most overrated trophy in football. So many clubs in the 70's in Europe said no to the competition because well, gotta take that long travel and danger of violence. But in here, OMG. There are teams thay brag about winning this even though the opposite team were like flat out drunk and only played because they were in risk of punishment by UEFA, like Liverpool 81. I think Copa Libertadores should be considered the pinnacle of what South American Club can achive. Like Champions League in Europe.

I’m from the US, but here are my thoughts: The MLS had the most call ups at the 2022 World Cup outside of Europe’s top 5 leagues. The list goes: 1. Premier League 2. La Liga 3. Bundesliga 4. Serie A 5. Ligue 1 6. MLS I know that doesn’t necessarily mean anything, but I do think it’s significant. I still think the MLS is quite a ways away from being a league where true world class players play their primes of their careers here. For the foreseeable future it’ll be a league that consists of talented young players before making the jump to Europe, MLS lifers, and soon to be retirees looking to retire in Miami or LA. And no member of the USMNT player pool who is currently in a top 5 league in Europe (+Eredivisie) should come to play in the MLS. (Unless they’re struggling for playing time and just need see the field.) But what about a player like Mark McKenzie? Currently playing in Belgium. But are we at a point where playing in the MLS would actually be better for his development? (Also, yes, I know he’s maybe not the best example. He plays for one of the best teams in Belgium that is competing in Conference League. But I think it’s a discussion to be had.) As teams start to play in truly state of the art football specific stadiums, and the league has beefed up it’s marketing efforts - so game attendance and revenue are going up. The league uses a salary cap to maintain parity, but the salary cap continues to gradually rise each year. No rational MLS fan would argue that the league is even close to being as good as a top 5 European league. But I think it’s fair to say that the MLS is on the rise and deserves to be in the discussion of global football. Am I crazy? Also, I’m genuinely not trying to start any fights lol. Just looking for unbiased perspective on how the rest of the world views the MLS.	86.0	t3_18j0sxr	reddit

185	What if some club win Conference League, can start in Champions League qualifiers due to winning domestic league and get knocked out?	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-14 09:56:54	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18i5a6u/what_if_some_club_win_conference_league_can_start/	I'm curious about a hypothetical situation in UEFA competitions. Suppose a club from a country without a direct Champions League group stage slot wins both the Conference League and their national championship. If they then participate in the Champions League qualifiers but get knocked out in a round that's not the final one, what happens next? Would they still need to go through the remaining qualifiers, automatically enter the group stage due to their Conference League victory, or maybe even they lose their right to participate in the Champions League qualifiers at the start? I couldn't find specific information in UEFA's rules about this scenario.	9.0	t3_18i5a6u	reddit

They also had the strongest front three in history perhaps. Solid defense still with a strong Umtiti who was wanted by United and even Madrid at the time of his signing in 2015. Young Piqué was there, Alves still running up and down the right side, young 28yo Messi, 28yo Suarez and 24 year old Neymar. They had an aging Iniesta who was at the top of his game until 2018 probably and had no good replacements for defense and strikers when MSN or Piqué were out. What went wrong especially in the seasons 2015-2016, 2016-17, and 2018-19. I think 1-2 UCLs were attainable there and not so far fetched. What went wrong, in your opinion?	128.0	t3_18h9ncs	reddit

He lived a crazy life with no self care, and was a bad motivation and influence to other teammates He won a World Cup and scored a goal with his hand which change the complete game and then had the audacity to admit he did it with his hands after he pretended for years he didn’t.

I watched the FIFA WC final (everyone did lol) and that was the first football match I watched throughout and absolutely loved every second of it. There was suspense and everything, and at the end the team I supported won so I was a happy guy. Actually not long before that my team (Pakistan) just lost the Cricket WC final against England so the FIFA win just made me feel better. Anyway, here are the Questions: 1: What is offside? I've watched many videos explaining it but don't quite understand what it means. 2: is it a goal if the ball is hit and it gets in the goal line but doesn't hit the net while mid air? Or is it a goal only when the ball is grounded in the goal line but doesn't hit the net? 3: Does it not waste time when the team celebrates? The timer still goes on after the goal while the team is celebrating so it does waste time in which maybe another goal can be scored by the opposing team to win a match. Is there a limit to the time you can celebrate? Yep that's it.	6.0	t3_18ha1a2	reddit

Unknown	2023-12-12 09:08:20	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18ght7j/why_did_michael_laudrup_never_go_on_to_become_an/	For those who remember Swansea’s 2012-13 season, Michael Laudrup had them playing some of the most exciting football in the League with some excellent players like Michu, Fernandez, De Guzman, Ki Sung-yueng. They famously won the League Cup, beat multiple top 6 teams and gave some iconic performances (The 2-0 against Arsenal away was a brilliant display). Next season, they give it a good go in the Europa, beating Valencia 3-0 away. Then Swansea go on a poor run of form, and Laudrup is sacked probably prematurely. And then… nothing? He goes to manage in Qatar for a few years and then seemingly has become unemployed since 2018. Is it the case Laudrup just gave up on management or did nobody really want him?	19.0	t3_18ght7j	reddit

I know there are a few of these but searched google with ‘Reddit’ and the majority of season predictions were from the start of this year so what are people’s thoughts as we approach the half way stage? I have a selfish reason for asking and appreciate this isn’t a gambling sub but each year, for Christmas, my brother and I give each other £30 worth of bets instead of presents and so I’m interested in everyone’s ideas. The bets can be anything. Any sport. Any type of bet. If there is a market, then it is fair game, but as this is a football sub I’ll start with some of my stupid predictions: - Jude Bellingham to win Balloon Doors (3-1/favourite) - Arsenal to win Champs league (8-1 / third favourite - a punt. Athough I don’t think they have the squad to win the Prem they can beat anyone on their day and have seemed to have found a way to win) - Mo Salah top goalscorer in the Prem (9-1, long shot. Foolish to bet against the beast but I’m betting that Haarland is plagued by injury woes like he was at Dortmund. Haarland has 14 goals, Mo, 11). - Brentford to be relegated (46-1, setting money on fire, but I look at everyone’s favourite moneyball squad and it looks pretty ropey to me. No Toney obvs. Can’t see them spending a lot in the window and their analytical edge erodes with each passing season. To be clear, I really don’t think Brentford will be relegated, there are worst teams than them in the Prem, but they are a lot shorter than 46-1 IMO. Anyhow, interested in your predictions. Any league, Euros, Olympics, anything! The obvious and the silly.	2.0	t3_18gwbcl	reddit

He seemed to have great awareness in/around penalty which difficult skill to master. However, I’ve to say he’s heavily overhyped. Jude isn’t that kinda of footballer that will get you off your couch like Zidane, Kaka, Messi, Ronaldinho, Bergkamp, etc did during their time. Jamal Musiala is the only one that’s probably close to these footballers, but you don’t hear his hype as much as Jude. Musiala can dance through the whole midfield and defense. However, Madrid PR make you believe that Jude is on that kind of level where he’s bang average when he doesn’t score. What’s your take on Jude? Edit - why is everyone mad here? Ain’t nobody say anything bad about Jude, but facts. He’s good football and scores goals but he ain’t no fucking Jamal Musiala! Most of you won’t even tell the difference between Jude and Ceballos when his purple patch ends.	27.0	t3_18gvpv8	reddit		
208	A year after the interview, I still think Ronaldo is still in the wrong and wouldn't have helped at all in Man U's current situation.	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-12 05:48:33	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18gey47/a_year_after_the_interview_i_still_think_ronaldo/	"Sorry in advance for the crappy grammar and questionable writing (also long) and the questionable take on the whole thing. I wanna see your opinion on this. &#x200B; Even though, Man United are in a kind of rough patch currently, I don't think Ronaldo could do anything if he was at the club. I find it baffling that people would think he was right and that if he stayed then he would do better. Even when he was at United, he couldn't carry them to glory. In fact, he was pretty bad in the few months before the World Cup. He was missing open goal opportunities against ammonia nicosia or something like that, a team in Cyprus. He deserved to get benched because of his poor performances and also to give the other players their chance to shine. His ego got in the way and he refused to get subbed in and left the game. I also found his 18 goal 3rd place top scorer thing to be overrated as the entire team was passing the ball to him instead of the team passing the ball to each other. He also scored mostly against the bottlers Spurs and lower teams like Norwich. I think ETH was right to suspend him when he left the game after having his little shitty attitude. I also think kicking Ronaldo out of the club was the right decision. Like who in the world would keep him after the interview. He did make some good points but still it was a horrible idea. I don't understand how people were like, ""Ronaldo is bigger than Man United."" Like in my opinion it's bullshit. They think him talking shit about the club and its staff (some true ngl) makes him right. Today, Ronaldo is doing pretty well in Saudi Pro League which is great for him. In fact, he reaches 50 goals. Like ya omg he's still a goalscoring machine, but holy shit remember he's in the saudi league. Like it isn't the worst league but it's fodder compared to the european league. Some people are like, ""Benzema and Mitrovic are struggling"", I find that's not a good point as basically they are in there for the money and retirement basically. They are also not doing that bad either. With Ronaldo doing so well abroad, people were also looking man u to see how the team's performing. With how man u is handling things, it seems that many people think that Ronaldo was right entirely and that ETH is a fraud. First thing is that Man u is shit but not as shit as people would think. Man U imo are still in contention for top 4 if you ignored the bournemouth game they were 3 points off of Man city. Secondly, their UCL campaign was horrible but mainly because of Onana. They scored the most in their group (12 to bayern's 11) but conceded the most goals (14) too. Third Man U is still rebuilding of course you're not gonna expect results right away. Look at Arteta with Arsenal, 4 years while it's Ten hag's second year and they already got 3rd place and the carabao cup."	15.0	t3_18gey47	reddit

If we look at their underlying numbers (https://understat.com/league/EPL) the xPTS has them at 6th not 13th, which would be an acceptable position for a team in their situation in my opinion. But does this matter? How does xPTS effect the long term? Is their any evidence to show eventually the reality matches the expected? Can a big difference remain between expected and reality or will it eventually even itself out with the potential for the team to catch up to its expected points or regress the expected points to its current situation. If a team wants to finish 6th and the underlying numbers suggest they should be 6th, despite being 13th in reality. Should a team keep everything the same and ignore the noise?	2.0	t3_18fu63a	reddit

212	Do Man Utd even have any players that are top 4 in their position ITL?	Unknown	2023-12-10 19:53:55	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18fbrvk/do_man_utd_even_have_any_players_that_are_top_4/	Do Man Utd even have any players that are top 4 in their position in this league? I think we Utd fans are being too demanding on Ten Hag based on the players he has. People can say he spent 400M$ and none of his players are working, but that’s a whole different story. Onana: Bad start Hojlund: Promising, no service Mount: Flop so far Casemiro: Great, slow start this season Antony: Noy great so far, I see the plan these last few games, not worth 90M. But back to my point, who on the Man Utd is top 4 or even top 6 in their position across the league? I think only Shaw (LB) and Bruno (CAM) are. A lot of the squad is deadwood and players on high wages that aren’t good enough. I think if we give Ten Hag another year or two with a competent board, the rebuild will work and we can finally become a consistent top 4 side.	19.0	t3_18fbrvk	reddit

223	Mudryk is 100% not as bad as people are claiming. I see a player who is monstrously skilled but with limited footballing education and lack of fundamentals, both factors which can easily be improved with good coaching and time.	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-08 18:06:37	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18dspkl/mudryk_is_100_not_as_bad_as_people_are_claiming_i/	The dude played in Ukraine till he was 21 and had a relatively late start to professional football. He was wrecking havoc in the Ukrainian league off pure pace, physicality and skill alone and has literally never needed to learn the fundamentals. Now hes thrown into the deep end at chelsea and people are eating him up. I get it. No one has time to watch him play every game(I do), and look at the horrible lowlights he does make here and there, but thats just piss poor PR. The truth? He has so much to learn, but he also already has so much that can never be taught. Things he lacks - Off ball positioning, being ready to receive the ball, decision making in transition, when and where to attempt take ons, ruthlessness in front of goal, demanding the ball and other intangibles. Will he ever become world class at these intangibles? likely not, but even being average at them could go a long way. But some of the skills and talent he does have? Lightning pace, 2 foot ability, excellent ball striking, transition dribbling, crossing, passing(especially that reverse through ball he likes to do which ive never seen him make an incomplete pass from). Despite his weaknesses and horrible low moments, he is also guaranteed to have a couple of high moments a game off pure skill and talent alone. his last few starts for example vs United - assist vs Brighton - Penalty won vs Arsenal - penalty won and goal vs Fulham - Goal hes only started 6 games btw and has somehow been key in all these games. Also to note when hes brought on as a sub, the vast majority of the time we are chasing a game and the other team closes shop and the entire team is clueless on breaking down these low blocks and Mudryk is the only one scape goated by chelsea fans. NO guarantee he will be a star player but I really believe in his talent and skill and am confident a good coach will get the best out of him.	76.0	t3_18dspkl	reddit

I think the manager, a man from Germany named Roger Schmidt, is one of the worst that my team had, for example, we have a very good player named Tiago Gouveia that hasnt played a lot, also he never does substitutions until the 80th minute and when he does that he replaces the best players like João Neves, also he brought to the team players that havent done anything like Arthur Cabral.

One day I just decided to wake up and fall in love to the football I'm still thinking how am I wasn't able to met with this sport earlier, my life could have been way different. Now I'm 20 years old, well I don't aim for top leagues but I genuinely want to make progress. But as you see from the topic I'm a total newbie. First of all, I'd like to tell you my physical and position. I'm 5'11 (1.80m) and 175 lbs (80 kg), my preferred position is forward (I'm not telling this to sound cool but after trying every position including goal keeper I've decided that.) During weekly matches that we do between I create my way to the goal through brute force and high speed, I have zero technique just playing raw strength. Now here's my questions: Technique: I have none, can't even juggle the ball for 5-6 times nor can dribble. But those stuff that I believe I can learn from internet my main question would be how I should work on my weak left foot. When I work on my feet should I treat both of them same or should I mostly focus to my strong foot %60 right %40 left for an example or all equal such as if I can juggle 5 with right, should do 5 with left as well. Vision: I've always wondered how players use their eyes for my way I look to the corner that I want to shoot then I look to my feet to set up my support leg and shoot. I have no idea if it's right or not sometimes I feel it's ok sometimes I don't, would like to hear you guys opinion. Program: I'm too broke to sign up to the gym so here's my plan: Tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday home workout without any equipments and sunday for stamina/control training on pitch that's the most I can do unfortunately. So here's my question, would one day stamina training per week on pitch would help? Should I do ball training after stamina training? These are mostly things on my mind. Thanks for reading my long post I appreciate to anyone who help, I'll also listen if you have any suggestions as well.	12.0	t3_18doye2	reddit

I mean, just in the Premier League - Tottenham, Newcastle, Man City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Brighton have key players out for the season and massive holes in their team and needed backups. Then we get to teams like Dortmund and Girona who will want to bolster their teams for the latter end of the season where they hope they can go further in the CL and LaLiga respectively. Not to mention the players available in January that many clubs will take, regardless of how many they already have. There’s no way, I think, this transfer window goes by without one big signing for the majority of clubs involved.	20.0	t3_18cxe1v	reddit

Second season 20 goals and 11 assists . Back to alti Frist season 9 Goals and 3 assist. Second season 15 goals 16 assist just in la Liga .

Against arsenal,utd city,liverpool and chelsea(I have not seen all their matches against small teams) they have been very lucky to get results in each of those matches whatever points they gained was not because of how well they played but because the other team missed their chances. They cannot play out from the back against a press and they cannot defend well even with their first choice backline in the sense that they always give too many chances to the other team.

I am asking this on a deeper level, and i am curious if someone has insights.	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-06 10:04:37	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18c0shl/what_is_the_primary_reason_why_for_example_a_3/	It is very important that i frame this question correctly, because i dont want to provoke „come on man this is obvious“ answers. Its very important that you understand what i am saying. A 3 League in a good Football country is still professional, someone who plays football in Germanys 3 division is a full time pro. He trains the same amount, has a strict diet, and everything is very similar if you compare it to a team like bayern. All Players are full time pros. My question is now (if we compare it to a team like bayern) why is the skill gap so so big? What is the reason? Dont get me wrong i know talent is a thing, but even 3 league players have very good fundamentals and have a fantastic first touch and everything, this arent sunday league bums where a fantastic first touch is a rare occasion. Fitness also doesnt make sense, both teams train fully and have a strict schedule. Is it the coaching? Is it small things that add up? What is the reason why real madrid can destroy a full pro side 7-0 if they feel like it? What exact aspect is so superior that they can literally obliterate the opponents? I know upsets happen but i want to know why in general the 3rd league side cant compete. I can see why a better pro side can dominate slightly, this can be given to slightly better fitness, bit more talent, a bit more coaching, but i dont see how a full pro side cant compete against another pro side. Like 6-0 runouts with 0 shots on target kinda games. Thank you.	56.0	t3_18c0shl	reddit

250	Network analysis of the worldwide footballer transfer market	Ming-Xia Li	2018-11-01 10:16:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00300v1	The transfer of football players is an important part in football games. Most studies on the transfer of football players focus on the transfer system and transfer fees but not on the transfer behavior itself. Based on the 470,792 transfer records from 1990 to 2016 among 23,605 football clubs in 206 countries and regions, we construct a directed footballer transfer network (FTN), where the nodes are the football clubs and the links correspond to the footballer transfers. A systemic analysis is conduced on the topological properties of the FTN. We find that the in-degrees, out-degrees, in-strengths and out-strengths of nodes follow bimodal distributions (a power law with exponential decay), while the distribution of link weights has a power-law tail. We further figure out the correlations between node degrees, node strengths and link weights. We also investigate the general characteristics of different measures of network centrality. Our network analysis of the global footballer transfer market sheds new lights into the investigation of the characteristics of transfer activities.			arxiv	['Wei-Xing Zhou', 'H. Eugene Stanley']	1.0
251	Networks of international football: communities, evolution and globalization of the game	Yang Li	2022-05-21 13:43:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10599v1	As the most popular sport around the globe, the game of football has recently intrigued much research interest to explore and distill useful and appealing information from the sport. Network science and graph-centric methods have been previously applied to study the importance of football players and teams. In this paper, for the first time we study the macroscopic evolution of the football society from a complex network point of view. Football game records within a time window of over a century were collected and expressed in a graph format, where participant teams are represented by graph nodes and the games between them are the graph edges. We carry out community detection and temporal analysis to reveal the dynamic features and the community structures embedded within the football network, offering the evidence of a continuously expanding football society. Spatio-temporal analysis is also implemented to unveil the temporal states that represent distinct development stages in the football history. Our analysis suggests that the evolution of the game receives considerable impact not only from major sport events, but also from multiple social and political incidents. The game of football and its evolution reflect significant historical transitions and turning points, and can provide a novel perspective for the study of the worldwide globalization process.			arxiv	['Gonzalo Mateos']	2.0

We also give examples showing that the corresponding result is not true for footballs of higher genera. Moreover, we classify the possible pairs (k,l) for which football patterns on the sphere exist satisfying a natural generalisation of the usual incidence relation between pentagons and hexagons to k-gons and l-gons.			arxiv	['D.

Excellent forecasts can be achieved by advanced machine learning methods applied to detailed historical data, especially in very popular sports such as football (soccer). Here we show that, despite the large number of confounding factors, the results of a football team in longer competitions (e.g., a national league) follow a basically linear trend useful for predictive purposes, too. In support of this claim, we present a set of experiments of linear regression on a database collecting the yearly results of 707 teams playing in 22 divisions from 11 countries, in 20 football seasons.			arxiv	[]	6.0

The network was optimized by experimenting with different activation functions, number of neurons and layers, learning rate and its decay, Nesterov momentum based stochastic gradient descent, L2 regularization, and early stopping. Simultaneous exploration of various aspects of neural network training is performed and their trade-offs are investigated. Our final model achieves a top-5 accuracy of 87.2% among 119 pricing categories, and places any footballer within 6.32% of his actual price on average.			arxiv	[]	7.0
257	Predictive modelling of football injuries	Stylianos Kampakis	2016-09-20 11:58:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07480v1	The goal of this thesis is to investigate the potential of predictive modelling for football injuries. This work was conducted in close collaboration with Tottenham Hotspurs FC (THFC), the PGA European tour and the participation of Wolverhampton Wanderers (WW). Three investigations were conducted: 1. Predicting the recovery time of football injuries using the UEFA injury recordings: The UEFA recordings is a common standard for recording injuries in professional football. For this investigation, three datasets of UEFA injury recordings were available. Different machine learning algorithms were used in order to build a predictive model. The performance of the machine learning models is then improved by using feature selection conducted through correlation-based subset feature selection and random forests. 2. Predicting injuries in professional football using exposure records: The relationship between exposure (in training hours and match hours) in professional football athletes and injury incidence was studied. A common problem in football is understanding how the training schedule of an athlete can affect the chance of him getting injured. The task was to predict the number of days a player can train before he gets injured. 3. Predicting intrinsic injury incidence using in-training GPS measurements: A significant percentage of football injuries can be attributed to overtraining and fatigue. GPS data collected during training sessions might provide indicators of fatigue, or might be used to detect very intense training sessions which can lead to overtraining. This research used GPS data gathered during training sessions of the first team of THFC, in order to predict whether an injury would take place during a week.			arxiv	[]	8.0
258	Explaining the difference between men's and women's football	Luca Pappalardo	2021-01-05 17:25:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01662v1	Women's football is gaining supporters and practitioners worldwide, raising questions about what the differences are with men's football. While the two sports are often compared based on the players' physical attributes, we analyze the spatio-temporal events during matches in the last World Cups to compare male and female teams based on their technical performance. We train an artificial intelligence model to recognize if a team is male or female based on variables that describe a match's playing intensity, accuracy, and performance quality. Our model accurately distinguishes between men's and women's football, revealing crucial technical differences, which we investigate through the extraction of explanations from the classifier's decisions. The differences between men's and women's football are rooted in play accuracy, the recovery time of ball possession, and the players' performance quality. Our methodology may help journalists and fans understand what makes women's football a distinct sport and coaches design tactics tailored to female teams.			arxiv	['Alessio Rossi', 'Giuseppe Pontillo', 'Michela Natilli', 'Paolo Cintia']	9.0

An analysis of RL and real-world football strategies	Atom Scott	2021-11-24 08:44:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12340v1	Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have made it possible to develop sophisticated agents that excel in a wide range of applications. Simulations using such agents can provide valuable information in scenarios that are difficult to scientifically experiment in the real world. In this paper, we examine the play-style characteristics of football RL agents and uncover how strategies may develop during training. The learnt strategies are then compared with those of real football players. We explore what can be learnt from the use of simulated environments by using aggregated statistics and social network analysis (SNA). As a result, we found that (1) there are strong correlations between the competitiveness of an agent and various SNA metrics and (2) aspects of the RL agents play style become similar to real world footballers as the agent becomes more competitive. We discuss further advances that may be necessary to improve our understanding necessary to fully utilise RL for the analysis of football.			arxiv	['Keisuke Fujii', 'Masaki Onishi']	10.0

Yeung	2023-02-18 10:02:45	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09276v1	With recently available football match event data that record the details of football matches, analysts and researchers have a great opportunity to develop new performance metrics, gain insight, and evaluate key performance. However, most sports sequential events modeling methods and performance metrics approaches could be incomprehensive in dealing with such large-scale spatiotemporal data (in particular, temporal process), thereby necessitating a more comprehensive spatiotemporal model and a holistic performance metric. To this end, we proposed the Transformer-Based Neural Marked Spatio Temporal Point Process (NMSTPP) model for football event data based on the neural temporal point processes (NTPP) framework. In the experiments, our model outperformed the prediction performance of the baseline models. Furthermore, we proposed the holistic possession utilization score (HPUS) metric for a more comprehensive football possession analysis. For verification, we examined the relationship with football teams' final ranking, average goal score, and average xG over a season. It was observed that the average HPUS showed significant correlations regardless of not using goal and details of shot information. Furthermore, we show HPUS examples in analyzing possessions, matches, and between matches.			arxiv	['Tony Sit', 'Keisuke Fujii']	11.0
261	Machine Learning Modeling to Evaluate the Value of Football Players	Chenyao Li	2022-07-22 22:34:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11361v1	In most sports, especially football, most coaches and analysts search for key performance indicators using notational analysis. This method utilizes a statistical summary of events based on video footage and numerical records of goal scores. Unfortunately, this approach is now obsolete owing to the continuous evolutionary increase in technology that simplifies the analysis of more complex process variables through machine learning (ML). Machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), uses algorithms to detect meaningful patterns and define a structure based on positional data. This research investigates a new method to evaluate the value of current football players, based on establishing the machine learning models to investigate the relations among the various features of players, the salary of players, and the market value of players. The data of the football players used for this project is from several football websites. The data on the salary of football players will be the proxy for evaluating the value of players, and other features will be used to establish and train the ML model for predicting the suitable salary for the players. The motivation is to explore what are the relations between different features of football players and their salaries - how each feature affects their salaries, or which are the most important features to affect the salary? Although many standards can reflect the value of football players, the salary of the players is one of the most intuitive and crucial indexes, so this study will use the salary of players as the proxy to evaluate their value. Moreover, many features of players can affect the valuation of the football players, but the value of players is mainly decided by three types of factors: basic characteristics, performance on the court, and achievements at the club.			arxiv	['Stylianos Kampakis', 'Philip Treleaven']	12.0
262	On the flight of an American Football	Curtis Horn	2007-06-04 18:34:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0366v1	In this paper we examine the detailed theory of the American football in flight, with spin and air resistance included. We find the theory has much in common with the theory of a gyroscope and also rocket trajectory with a misaligned thruster. Unfortunately most of the air resistance data, for rocketry and ballistics, is for speeds of Mach 1 or higher, where the air resistance increases dramatically. We shall approximate a realistic air resistance, at the slower speeds of football flight, with a drag force proportional to cross sectional area and either $v$ or $v^2$, depending on speed, where $v$ is velocity of the football. We begin with a discussion of the motion, giving as much detail as possible without the use of complex analytic calculations. We point out the previous errors made with moments of inertia and make the necessary corrections for more accurate results. We show that the shape of an American football closely resembles a parabola of revolution.			arxiv	['Heidi Fearn']	13.0
263	Using Twitter to predict football outcomes	Stylianos Kampakis	2014-11-05 11:50:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1243v1	Twitter has been proven to be a notable source for predictive modelling on various domains such as the stock market, the dissemination of diseases or sports outcomes. However, such a study has not been conducted in football (soccer) so far. The purpose of this research was to study whether data mined from Twitter can be used for this purpose. We built a set of predictive models for the outcome of football games of the English Premier League for a 3 month period based on tweets and we studied whether these models can overcome predictive models which use only historical data and simple football statistics. Moreover, combined models are constructed using both Twitter and historical data. The final results indicate that data mined from Twitter can indeed be a useful source for predicting games in the Premier League. The final Twitter-based model performs significantly better than chance when measured by Cohen's kappa and is comparable to the model that uses simple statistics and historical data. Combining both models raises the performance higher than it was achieved by each individual model. Thereby, this study provides evidence that Twitter derived features can indeed provide useful information for the prediction of football (soccer) outcomes.			arxiv	['Andreas Adamides']	14.0

In addition, it provides support for multiplayer and multi-agent experiments. We propose three full-game scenarios of varying difficulty with the Football Benchmarks and report baseline results for three commonly used reinforcement algorithms (IMPALA, PPO, and Ape-X DQN). We also provide a diverse set of simpler scenarios with the Football Academy and showcase several promising research directions.			arxiv	['Anton Raichuk', 'Piotr Stańczyk', 'Michał Zając', 'Olivier Bachem', 'Lasse Espeholt', 'Carlos Riquelme', 'Damien Vincent', 'Marcin Michalski', 'Olivier Bousquet', 'Sylvain Gelly']	15.0
265	A mathematical take on the competitive balance of a football league	Soudeep Deb	2021-02-18 12:06:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09288v1	Competitive balance in a football league is extremely important from the perspective of economic growth of the industry. Many researchers have earlier proposed different measures of competitive balance, which are primarily adapted from the standard economic theory. However, these measures fail to capture the finer nuances of the game. In this work, we discuss a new framework which is more suitable for a football league. First, we present a mathematical proof of an ideal situation where a football league becomes perfectly balanced. Next, a goal based index for competitive balance is developed. We present relevant theoretical results and show how the proposed index can be used to formally test for the presence of imbalance. The methods are implemented on the data from top five European leagues, and it shows that the new approach can better explain the changes in the seasonal competitive balance of the leagues. Further, using appropriate panel data models, we show that the proposed index is more suitable to analyze the variability in total revenues of the football leagues.			arxiv	[]	16.0

Chacoma	2021-04-20 22:30:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10272v2	In this paper, we study collective interaction dynamics emerging in the game of football-soccer. To do so, we surveyed a database containing body-sensors traces measured during three professional football matches, where we observed statistical patterns that we used to propose a stochastic model for the players' motion in the field. The model, which is based on linear interactions, captures in good approximation the spatiotemporal dynamics of a football team. Our theoretical framework, therefore, becomes an effective analytical tool to uncover the underlying cooperative mechanisms behind the complexity of football plays. Moreover, we showed that it can provide handy theoretical support for coaches to evaluate teams' and players' performances in both training sessions and competitive scenarios.			arxiv	['N.

Our goal is to characterize statistically the temporal sequence of ball movements in this collective sport game, searching for traits of complex behavior. Data were collected over a variety of matches in South American, European and World championships throughout 2005 and 2006. We show that the statistics of ball touches presents power-law tails and can be described by $q$-gamma distributions. To explain such behavior we propose a model that provides information on the characteristics of football dynamics. Furthermore, we discuss the statistics of duration of out-of-play intervals, not directly related to the previous scenario.			arxiv	['L. C. Malacarne', 'C. Anteneodo']	19.0

We also provide a goodness of fit measure. Our results show that multinomial-Dirichlet models are not only competitive with standard approaches, but they are also well calibrated and present reasonable goodness of fit.			arxiv	['Rafael Izbicki', 'Danilo Lopes', 'Luis Ernesto Salasar']	20.0

Despite the strong connection existing between football models and the bookmakers' betting odds, no authors have used the latter for improving the fit and the predictive accuracy of these models. We have developed a hierarchical Bayesian Poisson model in which the scoring rates of the teams are convex combinations of parameters estimated from historical data and the additional source of the betting odds. We apply our analysis to a nine-year dataset of the most popular European leagues in order to predict match outcomes for their tenth seasons. In this paper, we provide numerical and graphical checks for our model.			arxiv	['Francesco Pauli', 'Nicola Torelli']	21.0

To gain insights into the general level of their candidate reinforcements, many professional football clubs have access to extensive video footage and advanced statistics. However, the question whether a given player would fit the team's playing style often still remains unanswered. In this paper, we aim to bridge that gap by proposing a set of 21 player roles and introducing a method for automatically identifying the most applicable roles for each player from play-by-play event data collected during matches.			arxiv	['Jan Van Haaren']	22.0

Existing methods for player evaluation in football depend heavily on proprietary data, are not reproducible, and lag behind those of other major sports. We present four contributions to the study of football statistics in order to address these issues. First, we develop the R package nflscrapR to provide easy access to publicly available play-by-play data from the National Football League (NFL) dating back to 2009. Second, we introduce a novel multinomial logistic regression approach for estimating the expected points for each play. Third, we use the expected points as input into a generalized additive model for estimating the win probability for each play. Fourth, we introduce our nflWAR framework, using multilevel models to isolate the contributions of individual offensive skill players, and providing estimates for their individual wins above replacement (WAR). We estimate the uncertainty in each player's WAR through a resampling approach specifically designed for football, and we present these results for the 2017 NFL season. We discuss how our reproducible WAR framework, built entirely on publicly available data, can be easily extended to estimate WAR for players at any position, provided that researchers have access to data specifying which players are on the field during each play. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this work for NFL teams.			arxiv	['Samuel Ventura', 'Maksim Horowitz']	26.0

Gaulton	2019-02-26 18:33:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10106v1	American football is the most popular high school sport and is among the leading cause of injury among adolescents. While there has been considerable recent attention on the link between football and cognitive decline, there is also evidence of higher than expected rates of pain, obesity, and lower quality of life among former professional players, either as a result of repetitive head injury or through different mechanisms. Previously hidden downstream effects of playing football may have far-reaching public health implications for participants in youth and high school football programs. Our proposed study is a retrospective observational study that compares 1,153 high school males who played varsity football with 2,751 male students who did not. 1,951 of the control subjects did not play any sport and the remaining 800 controls played a non-contact sport. Our primary outcome is self-rated health measured at age 65. To control for potential confounders, we adjust for pre-exposure covariates with matching and model-based covariance adjustment. We will conduct an ordered testing procedure designed to use the full pool of 2,751 controls while also controlling for possible unmeasured differences between students who played sports and those who did not. We will quantitatively assess the sensitivity of the results to potential unmeasured confounding. The study will also assess secondary outcomes of pain, difficulty with activities of daily living, and obesity, as these are both important to individual well-being and have public health relevance.			arxiv	['Sameer K.

277	Going Deep: Models for Continuous-Time Within-Play Valuation of Game Outcomes in American Football with Tracking Data	Ronald Yurko	2019-06-05 00:21:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01760v3	Continuous-time assessments of game outcomes in sports have become increasingly common in the last decade. In American football, only discrete-time estimates of play value were possible, since the most advanced public football datasets were recorded at the play-by-play level. While measures such as expected points and win probability are useful for evaluating football plays and game situations, there has been no research into how these values change throughout the course of a play. In this work, we make two main contributions: First, we introduce a general framework for continuous-time within-play valuation in the National Football League using player-tracking data. Our modular framework incorporates several modular sub-models, to easily incorporate recent work involving player tracking data in football. Second, we use a long short-term memory recurrent neural network to construct a ball-carrier model to estimate how many yards the ball-carrier is expected to gain from their current position, conditional on the locations and trajectories of the ball-carrier, their teammates and opponents. Additionally, we demonstrate an extension with conditional density estimation so that the expectation of any measure of play value can be calculated in continuous-time, which was never before possible at such a granular level.			arxiv	['Francesca Matano', 'Lee F.

In this context, we have observed that even the market for football data has substantially grown. The analysis of football matches relies on the annotation of both individual players' and team actions, as well as the athletic performance of players. Consequently, annotating football events at a fine-grained level is a very expensive and error-prone task. Most existing semi-automatic tools for football match annotation rely on cameras and computer vision. However, those tools fall short in capturing team dynamics, and in extracting data of players who are not visible in the camera frame. To address these issues, in this manuscript we present FootApp, an AI-based system for football match annotation. First, our system relies on an advanced and mixed user interface that exploits both vocal and touch interaction. Second, the motor performance of players is captured and processed by applying machine learning algorithms to data collected from inertial sensors worn by players. Artificial intelligence techniques are then used to check the consistency of generated labels, including those regarding the physical activity of players, to automatically recognize annotation errors. Notably, we implemented a full prototype of the proposed system, performing experiments to show its effectiveness in a real-world adoption scenario.			arxiv	['Salvatore M.

279	An Empirical Study on Google Research Football Multi-agent Scenarios	Yan Song	2023-05-16 14:18:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09458v1	Few multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) research on Google Research Football (GRF) focus on the 11v11 multi-agent full-game scenario and to the best of our knowledge, no open benchmark on this scenario has been released to the public. In this work, we fill the gap by providing a population-based MARL training pipeline and hyperparameter settings on multi-agent football scenario that outperforms the bot with difficulty 1.0 from scratch within 2 million steps. Our experiments serve as a reference for the expected performance of Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO), a state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm where each agent tries to maximize its own policy independently across various training configurations. Meanwhile, we open-source our training framework Light-MALib which extends the MALib codebase by distributed and asynchronized implementation with additional analytical tools for football games. Finally, we provide guidance for building strong football AI with population-based training and release diverse pretrained policies for benchmarking. The goal is to provide the community with a head start for whoever experiment their works on GRF and a simple-to-use population-based training framework for further improving their agents through self-play. The implementation is available at https://github.com/Shanghai-Digital-Brain-Laboratory/DB-Football.			arxiv	['He Jiang', 'Zheng Tian', 'Haifeng Zhang', 'Yingping Zhang', 'Jiangcheng Zhu', 'Zonghong Dai', 'Weinan Zhang', 'Jun Wang']	30.0

286	Fantasy Football Prediction	Roman Lutz	2015-05-26 12:14:56	http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06918v1	The ubiquity of professional sports and specifically the NFL have lead to an increase in popularity for Fantasy Football. Users have many tools at their disposal: statistics, predictions, rankings of experts and even recommendations of peers. There are issues with all of these, though. Especially since many people pay money to play, the prediction tools should be enhanced as they provide unbiased and easy-to-use assistance for users. This paper provides and discusses approaches to predict Fantasy Football scores of Quarterbacks with relatively limited data. In addition to that, it includes several suggestions on how the data could be enhanced to achieve better results. The dataset consists only of game data from the last six NFL seasons. I used two different methods to predict the Fantasy Football scores of NFL players: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Neural Networks. The results of both are promising given the limited data that was used.			arxiv	[]	37.0

We do so using only the thirty-year record of which visiting teams played which home teams, on what date, and what the final score was. No real ""statistics"" are used. The method works best in basketball, likely because it is high-scoring and has long seasons. It works better in football and hockey than in baseball, but in baseball the predictions are closer to a theoretical optimum. The football predictions, while good, can in principle be made much better, and the hockey predictions can be made somewhat better. These findings tells us that in basketball, most statistics are subsumed by the scores of the games, whereas in football, further study of game and player statistics is necessary to predict games as well as can be done. Baseball and hockey lie somewhere in between."			arxiv	[]	38.0
288	Identifying top football players and springboard clubs from a football player collaboration and club transfer networks	Matic Tribušon	2016-02-11 10:21:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03664v1	We consider all players and clubs in top twenty world football leagues in the last fifteen seasons. The purpose of this paper is to reveal top football players and identify springboard clubs. To do that, we construct two separate weighted networks. Player collaboration network consists of players, that are connected to each other if they ever played together at the same club. In directed club transfer network, clubs are connected if players were ever transferred from one club to another. To get meaningful results, we perform different network analysis methods on our networks. Our approach based on PageRank reveals Christiano Ronaldo as the top player. Using a variation of betweenness centrality, we identify Standard Liege as the best springboard club.			arxiv	['Matevž Lenič']	39.0
289	Rating evaluation of sports development efficiency using statistical analysis: evidence from Russian football	Ilya Solntsev	2016-12-22 11:02:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07543v1	Increasing investments into various dimensions of sports draw a significant amount of attention to the way these resources are being managed and which organizations achieve development goals with higher efficiency. This paper reviews the methodology of designing an efficiency rating model for assessing sports entities, focusing on the experience of Russian football. The Russian Regional Efficiency of Football Development model aims to evaluate the regional federations of the Football Union of Russian via 5 dimensions. The scoring method of the model is based on the three-sigma rule of distribution. Support factors in the form of population density and climate were also included, since Russian regions significantly differentiate in these aspects. The findings of this paper showcased that not a single region was able to achieve a maximum 5- star rating, while regions set to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup did not score better compared to others. In conclusion the authors provide various suggestions on further developing and implementing rating models within global sports organizations.			arxiv	['Anatoly Vorobyev', 'Elnura Irmatova', 'Nikita Osokin']	40.0

To examine this phenomenon, we assemble FOOTBALL, which contains 1,455 broadcast transcripts from American football games across six decades that are automatically annotated with 250K player mentions and linked with racial metadata. We identify major confounding factors for researchers examining racial bias in FOOTBALL, and perform a computational analysis that supports conclusions from prior social science studies.			arxiv	"['Luke Yeh', 'Abram Handler', 'Alvin Grissom II', ""Brendan O'Connor"", 'Mohit Iyyer']"	41.0
291	Maximizing performance with an eye on the finances: a chance-constrained model for football transfer market decisions	Giovanni Pantuso	2019-11-10 08:31:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04689v2	Composing a team of professional players is among the most crucial decisions in association football. Nevertheless, transfer market decisions are often based on myopic objectives and are questionable from a financial point of view. This paper introduces a chance-constrained model to provide analytic support to club managers during transfer windows. The model seeks a top-performing team while adapting to different budgets and financial-risk profiles. In addition, it provides a new rating system that is able to numerically reflect the on-field performance of football players and thus contribute to an objective assessment of football players. The model and rating system are tested on a case study based on real market data. The data from the case study are available online for the benefit of future research.			arxiv	['Lars Magnus Hvattum']	42.0
292	Football tracking networks: Beyond event-based connectivity	J. M. Buldu	2020-11-11 19:04:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06014v1	We propose using Network Science as a complementary tool to analyze player and team behavior during a football match. Specifically, we introduce four kinds of networks based on different ways of interaction between players. Our approach's main novelty is to use tracking datasets to create football tracking networks, instead of constructing and analyzing the traditional networks based on events. In this way, we are able to capture player interactions that go beyond passes and introduce the concepts of (a) Ball Flow Networks, (b) Marking Networks, (c) Signed Proximity Networks and (d) Functional Coordination Networks. After defining the methodology for creating each kind of network, we show some examples using tracking datasets from four different matches of LaLiga Santander. Finally, we discuss some of the applications, limitations, and further improvements of football tracking networks.			arxiv	['D. Garrido', 'D. R. Antequera', 'J. Busquets', 'E. Estrada', 'R.

We first used random forest regression to select important variables predicting goal difference, which we used to calculate the Euclidian distances between teams. Creating a Laplacian eigenmap, we bisected the Fielder vector to identify the five major European football leagues' natural clusters. Our results showed how an unsupervised approach could successfully identify four clusters based on five basic performance metrics: shots, shots on target, shots conceded, possession, and pass success. The top two clusters identify those teams who dominate their respective leagues and are the best candidates to create the most competitive elite super league.			arxiv	['C. B. Beggs']	44.0

Which players should you draft for your team? We investigated this question using the wealth of data available from fantasy premier league football (soccer). Using the players' data from past seasons, for several seasons and several different budget constraints, we identified the highest scoring fantasy team for each season subject to each budget constraint. We then investigated quantifiable characteristics of these teams. Interestingly, across nearly every variable that is significant to the game of football and the budget, these top teams display diversity across these variables. Our results indicate that diversity is a general feature of top performing teams.			arxiv	['Jil Klünder', 'Julie Rowlett', 'Jonathan Stålberg']	45.0

For both growth and survival, it is crucial for recruiting departments to make smart choices when targeting players. Therefore, it is very important to identify the right parameters to monitor to predict market value. The following paper aims at determining the relevant features that successfully forecast future value for football players. Success is measured against their market value from TransferMarkt. To select prominent features, we use Lasso regressions and Random Forest algorithms. Some obvious variables are selected but we also observe some subtle dependencies between features and future market value. Finally, we rank the Golden Boy nominees using our forecasts and show our methodology can successfully compare football players based on their quality.			arxiv	['Elsa Bismuth', 'Aurèle Bohbot', 'Sébastien Coustou', 'Mathieu Lacome', 'Mathieu Rosenbaum']	46.0

Existing work has focused on tackling simplified scenarios of the game, or else leveraging expert demonstrations. In this paper, we develop a multi-agent system to play the full 11 vs. 11 game mode, without demonstrations. This game mode contains aspects that present major challenges to modern reinforcement learning algorithms; multi-agent coordination, long-term planning, and non-transitivity. To address these challenges, we present TiZero; a self-evolving, multi-agent system that learns from scratch. TiZero introduces several innovations, including adaptive curriculum learning, a novel self-play strategy, and an objective that optimizes the policies of multiple agents jointly. Experimentally, it outperforms previous systems by a large margin on the Google Research Football environment, increasing win rates by over 30%. To demonstrate the generality of TiZero's innovations, they are assessed on several environments beyond football; Overcooked, Multi-agent Particle-Environment, Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect-Four.			arxiv	['Shiyu Huang', 'Tim Pearce', 'Wenze Chen', 'Wei-Wei Tu']	47.0
297	Football fever: goal distributions and non-Gaussian statistics	Elmar Bittner	2006-06-01 16:42:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0606016v1	Analyzing football score data with statistical techniques, we investigate how the not purely random, but highly co-operative nature of the game is reflected in averaged properties such as the probability distributions of scored goals for the home and away teams. As it turns out, especially the tails of the distributions are not well described by the Poissonian or binomial model resulting from the assumption of uncorrelated random events. Instead, a good effective description of the data is provided by less basic distributions such as the negative binomial one or the probability densities of extreme value statistics. To understand this behavior from a microscopical point of view, however, no waiting time problem or extremal process need be invoked. Instead, modifying the Bernoulli random process underlying the Poissonian model to include a simple component of self-affirmation seems to describe the data surprisingly well and allows to understand the observed deviation from Gaussian statistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood as special cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score data from many leagues in Europe as well as from international tournaments, including data from all past tournaments of the ``FIFA World Cup'' series, and found the proposed models to be applicable rather universally. In particular, here we analyse the results of the German women's premier football league and consider the two separate German men's premier leagues in the East and West during the cold war times and the unified league after 1990 to see how scoring in football and the component of self-affirmation depend on cultural and political circumstances.			arxiv	['Andreas Nussbaumer', 'Wolfhard Janke', 'Martin Weigel']	48.0

A Statistical Analysis	Jiri Mazurek	2018-02-03 12:50:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00967v1	Many pundits and fans ask themselves the same question: Which football player bears most resemblance to Lionel Messi? Is it Chelsea's Eden Hazard? Is it Paulo Dybala, the heir to Messi in the national team of Argentina? Or is the most alike player to Messi someone completely else? In general, the research on the evaluation of players' performances originated in the context of baseball in the USA, but, currently, it is of great importance in almost every team sport on the planet. Specifically, football clubs' managers can use the data on player's similarity when looking for replacement of their players by other, presumably similar ones. Also, the research in the presented direction is certainly interesting both for football pundits and football fans. Therefore, the aim of this study is to answer the question from the title with the use of the statistical analysis based on the data from ongoing league season retrieved from WhoScored (WS) database. WS provides detailed data (up to 24 parameters such as goals scored, the number of assists, shots on goal, passes, dribbles or fouls) for players of TOP 5 European leagues, and ranks them with respect to their overall performance. For this study, 17 parameters (criteria) most relevant for an attacking player were used, and a set of 28 players, candidates to be 'most alike to Messi' from WS TOP 100 list were selected. After data normalization and application of a proper metric function the most similar player to Lionel Messi was found.			arxiv	[]	49.0
299	Football is becoming more predictable; Network analysis of 88 thousands matches in 11 major leagues	Victor Martins Maimone	2019-08-23 19:25:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08991v2	In recent years excessive monetization of football and professionalism among the players has been argued to have affected the quality of the match in different ways. On the one hand, playing football has become a high-income profession and the players are highly motivated; on the other hand, stronger teams have higher incomes and therefore afford better players leading to an even stronger appearance in tournaments that can make the game more imbalanced and hence predictable. To quantify and document this observation, in this work we take a minimalist network science approach to measure the predictability of football over 26 years in major European leagues. We show that over time, the games in major leagues have indeed become more predictable. We provide further support for this observation by showing that inequality between teams has increased and the home-field advantage has been vanishing ubiquitously. We do not include any direct analysis on the effects of monetization on football's predictability or therefore, lack of excitement, however, we propose several hypotheses which could be tested in future analyses.			arxiv	['Taha Yasseri']	50.0
300	Genre determining prediction: Non-standard TAM marking in football language	Jakob Egetenmeyer	2021-06-30 08:01:57	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15872v1	German and French football language display tense-aspect-mood (TAM) forms which differ from the TAM use in other genres. In German football talk, the present indicative may replace the pluperfect subjunctive. In French reports of football matches, the imperfective past may occur instead of a perfective past tense-aspect form. We argue that the two phenomena share a functional core and are licensed in the same way, which is a direct result of the genre they occur in. More precisely, football match reports adhere to a precise script and specific events are temporally determined in terms of objective time. This allows speakers to exploit a secondary function of TAM forms, namely, they shift the temporal perspective. We argue that it is on the grounds of the genre that comprehenders predict the deviating forms and are also able to decode them. We present various corpus studies where we explore the functioning of these phenomena in order to gain insights into their distribution, grammaticalization and their functioning in discourse. Relevant factors are Aktionsart properties, rhetorical relations and their interaction with other TAM forms. This allows us to discuss coping mechanisms on the part of the comprehender. We broaden our understanding of the phenomena, which have only been partly covered for French and up to now seem to have been ignored in German.			arxiv	[]	51.0
301	Automatic event detection in football using tracking data	Ferran Vidal-Codina	2022-02-01 23:20:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00804v3	One of the main shortcomings of event data in football, which has been extensively used for analytics in the recent years, is that it still requires manual collection, thus limiting its availability to a reduced number of tournaments. In this work, we propose a deterministic decision tree-based algorithm to automatically extract football events using tracking data, which consists of two steps: (1) a possession step that evaluates which player was in possession of the ball at each frame in the tracking data, as well as the distinct player configurations during the time intervals where the ball is not in play to inform set piece detection; (2) an event detection step that combines the changes in ball possession computed in the first step with the laws of football to determine in-game events and set pieces. The automatically generated events are benchmarked against manually annotated events and we show that in most event categories the proposed methodology achieves $+90\%$ detection rate across different tournaments and tracking data providers. Finally, we demonstrate how the contextual information offered by tracking data can be leveraged to increase the granularity of auto-detected events, and exhibit how the proposed framework may be used to conduct a myriad of data analyses in football.			arxiv	['Nicolas Evans', 'Bahaeddine El Fakir', 'Johsan Billingham']	52.0
302	Graph Neural Network based Agent in Google Research Football	Yizhan Niu	2022-04-23 21:26:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11142v1	Deep neural networks (DNN) can approximate value functions or policies for reinforcement learning, which makes the reinforcement learning algorithms more powerful. However, some DNNs, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), cannot extract enough information or take too long to obtain enough features from the inputs under specific circumstances of reinforcement learning. For example, the input data of Google Research Football, a reinforcement learning environment which trains agents to play football, is the small map of players' locations. The information is contained not only in the coordinates of players, but also in the relationships between different players. CNNs can neither extract enough information nor take too long to train. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep q-learning network (DQN) with a graph neural network (GNN) as its model. The GNN transforms the input data into a graph which better represents the football players' locations so that it extracts more information of the interactions between different players. With two GNNs to approximate its local and target value functions, this DQN allows players to learn from their experience by using value functions to see the prospective value of each intended action. The proposed model demonstrated the power of GNN in the football game by outperforming other DRL models with significantly fewer steps.			arxiv	['Jinglong Liu', 'Yuhao Shi', 'Jiren Zhu']	53.0
303	Automated player identification and indexing using two-stage deep learning network	Hongshan Liu	2022-04-26 02:59:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13809v2	American football games attract significant worldwide attention every year. Identifying players from videos in each play is also essential for the indexing of player participation. Processing football game video presents great challenges such as crowded settings, distorted objects, and imbalanced data for identifying players, especially jersey numbers. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based player tracking system to automatically track players and index their participation per play in American football games. It is a two-stage network design to highlight areas of interest and identify jersey number information with high accuracy. First, we utilize an object detection network, a detection transformer, to tackle the player detection problem in a crowded context. Second, we identify players using jersey number recognition with a secondary convolutional neural network, then synchronize it with a game clock subsystem. Finally, the system outputs a complete log in a database for play indexing. We demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of player tracking system by analyzing the qualitative and quantitative results on football videos. The proposed system shows great potential for implementation in and analysis of football broadcast video.			arxiv	['Colin Aderon', 'Noah Wagon', 'Abdul Latif Bamba', 'Xueshen Li', 'Huapu Liu', 'Steven MacCall', 'Yu Gan']	54.0
304	Explainable expected goal models for performance analysis in football analytics	Mustafa Cavus	2022-06-14 23:56:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07212v2	The expected goal provides a more representative measure of the team and player performance which also suit the low-scoring nature of football instead of score in modern football. The score of a match involves randomness and often may not represent the performance of the teams and players, therefore it has been popular to use the alternative statistics in recent years such as shots on target, ball possessions, and drills. To measure the probability of a shot being a goal by the expected goal, several features are used to train an expected goal model which is based on the event and tracking football data. The selection of these features, the size and date of the data, and the model which are used as the parameters that may affect the performance of the model. Using black-box machine learning models for increasing the predictive performance of the model decreases its interpretability that causes the loss of information that can be gathered from the model. This paper proposes an accurate expected goal model trained consisting of 315,430 shots from seven seasons between 2014-15 and 2020-21 of the top-five European football leagues. Moreover, this model is explained by using explainable artificial intelligence tool to obtain an explainable expected goal model for evaluating a team or player performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that demonstrates a practical application of an explainable artificial intelligence tool aggregated profiles to explain a group of observations on an accurate expected goal model for monitoring the team and player performance. Moreover, these methods can be generalized to other sports branches.			arxiv	['Przemysław Biecek']	55.0
305	Towards Active Learning for Action Spotting in Association Football Videos	Silvio Giancola	2023-04-09 11:50:41	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04220v1	Association football is a complex and dynamic sport, with numerous actions occurring simultaneously in each game. Analyzing football videos is challenging and requires identifying subtle and diverse spatio-temporal patterns. Despite recent advances in computer vision, current algorithms still face significant challenges when learning from limited annotated data, lowering their performance in detecting these patterns. In this paper, we propose an active learning framework that selects the most informative video samples to be annotated next, thus drastically reducing the annotation effort and accelerating the training of action spotting models to reach the highest accuracy at a faster pace. Our approach leverages the notion of uncertainty sampling to select the most challenging video clips to train on next, hastening the learning process of the algorithm. We demonstrate that our proposed active learning framework effectively reduces the required training data for accurate action spotting in football videos. We achieve similar performances for action spotting with NetVLAD++ on SoccerNet-v2, using only one-third of the dataset, indicating significant capabilities for reducing annotation time and improving data efficiency. We further validate our approach on two new datasets that focus on temporally localizing actions of headers and passes, proving its effectiveness across different action semantics in football. We believe our active learning framework for action spotting would support further applications of action spotting algorithms and accelerate annotation campaigns in the sports domain.			arxiv	['Anthony Cioppa', 'Julia Georgieva', 'Johsan Billingham', 'Andreas Serner', 'Kerry Peek', 'Bernard Ghanem', 'Marc Van Droogenbroeck']	56.0

However, the absence of standardized environment settings and unified evaluation metrics for multi-agent scenarios hampers the consistent understanding of various studies. Furthermore, the challenging 5-vs-5 and 11-vs-11 full-game scenarios have received limited thorough examination due to their substantial training complexities. To address these gaps, this paper extends the original environment by not only standardizing the environment settings and benchmarking cooperative learning algorithms across different scenarios, including the most challenging full-game scenarios, but also by discussing approaches to enhance football AI from diverse perspectives and introducing related research tools. Specifically, we provide a distributed and asynchronous population-based self-play framework with diverse pre-trained policies for faster training, two football-specific analytical tools for deeper investigation, and an online leaderboard for broader evaluation. The overall expectation of this work is to advance the study of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning on Google Research Football environment, with the ultimate goal of benefiting real-world sports beyond virtual games.			arxiv	['He Jiang', 'Haifeng Zhang', 'Zheng Tian', 'Weinan Zhang', 'Jun Wang']	57.0

Deshpande	2018-08-12 12:46:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03934v2	More than 1 million students play high school American football annually, but many health professionals have recently questioned its safety or called for its ban. These concerns have been partially driven by reports of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), increased risks of neurodegenerative disease, and associations between concussion history and later-life cognitive impairment and depression among retired professional football players. A recent observational study of a cohort of men who graduated from a Wisconsin high school in 1957 found no statistically significant harmful effects of playing high school football on a range of cognitive, psychological, and socio-economic outcomes measured at ages 35, 54, 65, and 72. Unfortunately, these findings may not generalize to younger populations, thanks to changes and improvements in football helmet technology and training techniques. In particular, these changes may have led to increased perceptions of safety but ultimately more dangerous styles of play, characterized by the frequent sub-concussive impacts thought to be associated with later-life neurological decline. In this work, we replicate the methodology of that earlier matched observational study using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). These include adolescent and family co-morbidities, academic experience, self-reported levels of general health and physical activity, and the score on the Add Health Picture Vocabulary Test. Our primary outcome is the CES-D score measured in 2008 when subjects were aged 24 -- 34 and settling into early adulthood. We also examine several secondary outcomes related to physical and psychological health, including suicidality. Our results can provide insight into the natural history of potential football-related decline and dysfunction.			arxiv	['Raiden B. Hasegawa', 'Jordan Weiss', 'Dylan S. Small']	58.0
308	Game Plan: What AI can do for Football, and What Football can do for AI	Karl Tuyls	2020-11-18 10:26:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09192v1	The rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has opened unprecedented analytics possibilities in various team and individual sports, including baseball, basketball, and tennis. More recently, AI techniques have been applied to football, due to a huge increase in data collection by professional teams, increased computational power, and advances in machine learning, with the goal of better addressing new scientific challenges involved in the analysis of both individual players' and coordinated teams' behaviors. The research challenges associated with predictive and prescriptive football analytics require new developments and progress at the intersection of statistical learning, game theory, and computer vision. In this paper, we provide an overarching perspective highlighting how the combination of these fields, in particular, forms a unique microcosm for AI research, while offering mutual benefits for professional teams, spectators, and broadcasters in the years to come. We illustrate that this duality makes football analytics a game changer of tremendous value, in terms of not only changing the game of football itself, but also in terms of what this domain can mean for the field of AI. We review the state-of-the-art and exemplify the types of analysis enabled by combining the aforementioned fields, including illustrative examples of counterfactual analysis using predictive models, and the combination of game-theoretic analysis of penalty kicks with statistical learning of player attributes. We conclude by highlighting envisioned downstream impacts, including possibilities for extensions to other sports (real and virtual).			arxiv	['Shayegan Omidshafiei', 'Paul Muller', 'Zhe Wang', 'Jerome Connor', 'Daniel Hennes', 'Ian Graham', 'William Spearman', 'Tim Waskett', 'Dafydd Steele', 'Pauline Luc', 'Adria Recasens', 'Alexandre Galashov', 'Gregory Thornton', 'Romuald Elie', 'Pablo Sprechmann', 'Pol Moreno', 'Kris Cao', 'Marta Garnelo', 'Praneet Dutta', 'Michal Valko', 'Nicolas Heess', 'Alex Bridgland', 'Julien Perolat', 'Bart De Vylder', 'Ali Eslami', 'Mark Rowland', 'Andrew Jaegle', 'Remi Munos', 'Trevor Back', 'Razia Ahamed', 'Simon Bouton', 'Nathalie Beauguerlange', 'Jackson Broshear', 'Thore Graepel', 'Demis Hassabis']	59.0
309	Deep Artificial Intelligence for Fantasy Football Language Understanding	Aaron Baughman	2021-11-04 14:02:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02874v1	Fantasy sports allow fans to manage a team of their favorite athletes and compete with friends. The fantasy platform aligns the real-world statistical performance of athletes to fantasy scoring and has steadily risen in popularity to an estimated 9.1 million players per month with 4.4 billion player card views on the ESPN Fantasy Football platform from 2018-2019. In parallel, the sports media community produces news stories, blogs, forum posts, tweets, videos, podcasts and opinion pieces that are both within and outside the context of fantasy sports. However, human fantasy football players can only analyze an average of 3.9 sources of information. Our work discusses the results of a machine learning pipeline to manage an ESPN Fantasy Football team. The use of trained statistical entity detectors and document2vector models applied to over 100,000 news sources and 2.3 million articles, videos and podcasts each day enables the system to comprehend natural language with an analogy test accuracy of 100% and keyword test accuracy of 80%. Deep learning feedforward neural networks provide player classifications such as if a player will be a bust, boom, play with a hidden injury or play meaningful touches with a cumulative 72% accuracy. Finally, a multiple regression ensemble uses the deep learning output and ESPN projection data to provide a point projection for each of the top 500+ fantasy football players in 2018. The point projection maintained a RMSE of 6.78 points. The best fit probability density function from a set of 24 is selected to visualize score spreads. Within the first 6 weeks of the product launch, the total number of users spent a cumulative time of over 4.6 years viewing our AI insights. The training data for our models was provided by a 2015 to 2016 web archive from Webhose, ESPN statistics, and Rotowire injury reports. We used 2017 fantasy football data as a test set.			arxiv	['Micah Forester', 'Jeff Powell', 'Eduardo Morales', 'Shaun McPartlin', 'Daniel Bohm']	60.0
310	A Machine Learning Approach for Player and Position Adjusted Expected Goals in Football (Soccer)	James H. Hewitt	2023-01-19 22:17:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13052v2	Football is a very result-driven industry, with goals being rarer than in most sports, so having further parameters to judge the performance of teams and individuals is key. Expected Goals (xG) allow further insight than just a scoreline. To tackle the need for further analysis in football, this paper uses machine learning applications that are developed and applied to Football Event data. From the concept, a Binary Classification problem is created whereby a probabilistic valuation is outputted using Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting based approaches. The model successfully predicts xGs probability values for football players based on 15,575 shots. The proposed solution utilises StatsBomb as the data provider and an industry benchmark to tune the models in the right direction. The proposed ML solution for xG is further used to tackle the age-old cliche of: 'the ball has fallen to the wrong guy there'. The development of the model is used to adjust and gain more realistic values of expected goals than the general models show. To achieve this, this paper tackles Positional Adjusted xG, splitting the training data into Forward, Midfield, and Defence with the aim of providing insight into player qualities based on their positional sub-group. Positional Adjusted xG successfully predicts and proves that more attacking players are better at accumulating xG. The highest value belonged to Forwards followed by Midfielders and Defenders. Finally, this study has further developments into Player Adjusted xG with the aim of proving that Messi is statistically at a higher efficiency level than the average footballer. This is achieved by using Messi subset samples to quantify his qualities in comparison to the average xG models finding that Messi xG performs 347 xG higher than the general model outcome.			arxiv	['Oktay Karakuş']	61.0

Mira	2006-07-20 18:19:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0607183v1	The effect of increasing goal mouth size on the number of goals scored in a football match is discussed in a very preliminary and simple way, considering elastic collisions of the ball with the posts. The result is obtained on the basis of data taken from the Spanish Professional League, that show a high number of shots-to-post. Surprisingly, there is a direct correlation of the increase in goal mouth area with the increase of goals.			arxiv	[]	63.0

We find that the networks have the small-world property, and their degree distributions are fitted well by a truncated gamma distribution function. In order to reproduce these properties of networks, a model based on a Markov chain is proposed.			arxiv	['Ken Yamamoto', 'Yoshihiro Yamazaki']	64.0
314	The Sensitivity of College Football Rankings to Several Modeling Choices	Andrew T. Karl	2014-03-29 15:54:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.7642v1	This paper proposes a multiple-membership generalized linear mixed model for ranking college football teams using only their win/loss records. The model results in an intractable, high-dimensional integral due to the random effects structure and nonlinear link function. We use recent data sets to explore the effect of the choice of integral approximation and other modeling assumptions on the rankings. Varying the modeling assumptions sometimes leads to changes in the team rankings that could affect bowl assignments.			arxiv	[]	65.0
315	A Markovian model for association football possession and its outcomes	Javier López Peña	2014-03-31 13:45:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.7993v1	We propose a bottom-up approach to the study of possession and its outcomes for association football, based on probabilistic finite state automata with transition probabilities described by a Markov process. We show how even a very simple model yields faithful approximations to the distribution of passing sequences and chances of taking shots for English Premier League teams, which we fit using a whole season of granular game data (380 games). We compare the resulting model with classical top-down distributions traditionally used to describe possessions, showing that the Markov models yield a more accurate asymptotic behaviour.			arxiv	[]	66.0

In this network, a player on a certain area in the divided fields is a node, and a pass between two nodes corresponds to an edge. Our model is characterized by the consecutive choice of a node dependent on its intrinsic fitness. We derive the explicit expression of the degree distribution, and find that the derived distribution reproduces the real data quit well.			arxiv	['Ken Yamamoto', 'Yoshihiro Yamazaki']	67.0

Although the majority of the on-the-ball actions during games constitutes of passes, many of the currently available metrics focus on measuring the quality of shots only. To help bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach to measure players' on-the-ball contributions from passes during games. Our proposed approach measures the expected impact of each pass on the scoreline.			arxiv	['Jan Van Haaren']	70.0

322	On convergence to a football	Hao Fang	2015-01-27 19:44:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06881v2	We show that spheres of positive constant curvature with $n$ ($n\geq3$) conic points converge to a sphere of positive constant curvature with two conic points (or called an (American) football) in Gromov-Hausdorff topology when the corresponding singular divisors converge to a critical divisor in the sense of Troyanov. We prove this convergence in two different ways. Geometrically, the convergence follows from Luo-Tian's explicit description of conic spheres as boundaries of convex polytopes in $S^{3}$. Analytically, regarding the conformal factors as the singular solutions to the corresponding PDE, we derive the required a priori estimates and convergence result after proper reparametrization.			arxiv	['Mijia Lai']	73.0

Our method first clusters formations into several average formations: `442,' `4141,' `433,' `541,' and `343.' Then, each average formation is further divided into more specific patterns in which the configurations of players are slightly different. The latter step is based on hierarchical clustering and the Delaunay method, which defines the formation of a team as an adjacency matrix of Delaunay triangulation. A formation clustered using our method is expressed in a form such as `442-C1'.			arxiv	['Yoshihiro Yamazaki']	74.0

For that purpose, we model minute-by-minute in-game statistics of Bundesliga matches using hidden Markov models (HMMs). To allow for within-state correlation of the variables considered, we formulate multivariate state-dependent distributions using copulas. For the Bundesliga data considered, we find that the fitted HMMs comprise states which can be interpreted as a team showing different levels of control over a match. Our modelling framework enables inference related to causes of momentum shifts and team tactics, which is of much interest to managers, bookmakers, and sports fans."			arxiv	['Roland Langrock', 'Antonello Maruotti']	76.0

Our data consists of roughly 50,000 penalties from the eleven~most recent seasons in European men's football competitions. About one third of the penalties are from more than 1,500 penalty shootouts. We find that shootout conversion rates are significantly lower, and attribute this to worse performance of shooters rather than better performance of goalkeepers. We also find that, statistically, there is no advantage for either team in the usual alternating shooting order. These main findings are complemented by a number of more detailed analyses.			arxiv	['David Schoch', 'Ulrik Brandes']	83.0

To help bridge this gap, we present a method that can estimate continuous full-pitch tracking data from discrete data made from broadcast footage. Such data could be collected by clubs or players at a similar cost to event data, which is widely available down to semi-professional level.

334	Space evaluation in football games via field weighting based on tracking data	Takuma Narizuka	2020-01-31 02:05:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11629v2	In football game analysis, space evaluation is an important issue because it is directly related to the quality of ball passing or player formations. Previous studies have primarily focused on a field division approach wherein a field is divided into dominant regions in which a certain player can arrive prior to any other players. However, the field division approach is oversimplified because all locations within a region are regarded as uniform herein. The objective of the current study is to propose a fundamental framework for space evaluation based on field weighting. In particular, we employed the motion model and calculated a minimum arrival time $ \tau $ for each player to all locations on the football field. Our main contribution is that two variables $ \tau_{\textrm{of}} $ and $ \tau_{\textrm{df}} $ corresponding to the minimum arrival time for offense and defense teams are considered; using $ \tau_{\textrm{of}} $ and $ \tau_{\textrm{df}} $, new orthogonal variables $ z_{1} $ and $ z_{2} $ are defined. In particular, based on real datasets comprising of data from 45 football games of the J1 League in 2018, we provide a detailed characterization of $ z_{1} $ and $ z_{2} $ in terms of ball passing. By using our method, we found that $ z_{1}(\vec{x}, t) $ and $ z_{2}(\vec{x}, t) $ represent the degree of safety for a pass made to $ \vec{x} $ at $ t $ and degree of sparsity of $ \vec{x} $ at $ t $, respectively; the success probability of passes could be well-fitted using a sigmoid function. Moreover, a new type of field division approach and evaluation of ball passing just before shoots using real game data are discussed.			arxiv	['Yoshihiro Yamazaki', 'Kenta Takizawa']	85.0
335	Defining a historic football team: Using Network Science to analyze Guardiola's F.C. Barcelona	J. M. Buldu	2019-09-19 10:14:50	http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08903v1	The application of Network Science to social systems has introduced new methodologies to analyze classical problems such as the emergence of epidemics, the arousal of cooperation between individuals or the propagation of information along social networks. More recently, the organization of football teams and their performance have been unveiled using metrics coming from Network Science, where a team is considered as a complex network whose nodes (i.e., players) interact with the aim of overcoming the opponent network. Here, we combine the use of different network metrics to extract the particular signature of the F.C. Barcelona coached by Guardiola, which has been considered one of the best teams along football history. We have first compared the network organization of Guardiola's team with their opponents along one season of the Spanish national league, identifying those metrics with statistically significant differences and relating them with the Guardiola's game. Next, we have focused on the temporal nature of football passing networks and calculated the evolution of all network properties along a match, instead of considering their average. In this way, we are able to identify those network metrics that enhance the probability of scoring/receiving a goal, showing that not all teams behave in the same way and how the organization Guardiola's F.C. Barcelona is different from the rest, including its clustering coefficient, shortest-path length, largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix, algebraic connectivity and centrality distribution.			arxiv	['J.

336	Bigger data, better questions, and a return to fourth down behavior: an introduction to a special issue on tracking data in the National football League	Michael J. Lopez	2019-09-23 21:47:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10631v3	Most historical National Football League (NFL) analysis, both mainstream and academic, has relied on public, play-level data to generate team and player comparisons. Given the number of oft omitted variables that impact on-field results, such as play call, game situation, and opponent strength, findings tend to be more anecdotal than actionable. With the release of player tracking data, however, analysts can better ask and answer questions to isolate skill and strategy. In this article, we highlight the limitations of traditional analyses, and use a decades-old punching bag for analysts, fourth-down strategy, as a microcosm for why tracking data is needed. Specifically, we assert that, in absence of using the precise yardage needed for a first down, past findings supporting an aggressive fourth down strategy may have been overstated. Next, we synthesize recent work that comprises this special Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports issue into player tracking data in football. Finally, we conclude with some best practices and limitations regarding usage of this data. The release of player tracking data marks a transition for the league and its' analysts, and we hope this issue helps guide innovation in football analytics for years to come.			arxiv	[]	87.0
337	TiKick: Towards Playing Multi-agent Football Full Games from Single-agent Demonstrations	Shiyu Huang	2021-10-09 08:34:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04507v5	Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved super-human performance on complex video games (e.g., StarCraft II and Dota II). However, current DRL systems still suffer from challenges of multi-agent coordination, sparse rewards, stochastic environments, etc. In seeking to address these challenges, we employ a football video game, e.g., Google Research Football (GRF), as our testbed and develop an end-to-end learning-based AI system (denoted as TiKick) to complete this challenging task. In this work, we first generated a large replay dataset from the self-playing of single-agent experts, which are obtained from league training. We then developed a distributed learning system and new offline algorithms to learn a powerful multi-agent AI from the fixed single-agent dataset. To the best of our knowledge, Tikick is the first learning-based AI system that can take over the multi-agent Google Research Football full game, while previous work could either control a single agent or experiment on toy academic scenarios. Extensive experiments further show that our pre-trained model can accelerate the training process of the modern multi-agent algorithm and our method achieves state-of-the-art performances on various academic scenarios.			arxiv	['Wenze Chen', 'Longfei Zhang', 'Shizhen Xu', 'Ziyang Li', 'Fengming Zhu', 'Deheng Ye', 'Ting Chen', 'Jun Zhu']	88.0
338	A Validation Procedure for the Estimation of Reachable Regions in Football	M. Renkin	2022-04-07 08:34:19	http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13992v1	Modelling the trajectorial motion of humans along the ground is a foundational task in the quantitative analysis of sports like association football. Most existing models of football player motion have not been validated yet with respect to actual data. One of the reasons for this lack is that performing such a validation is not straightforward, because models of player motion are usually phrased in a way that emphasises possibly reachable positions rather than expected positions. Since positional data of football players typically contains outliers, this data may misrepresent the range of actually reachable positions. This paper proposes a validation routine for trajectorial motion models that measures and optimises the ability of a motion model to accurately predict all possibly reachable positions by favoring the smallest predicted area of reachable positions that encompasses all observed reached positions up to a manually defined threshold. We demonstrate validation and optimisation on four different motion models, assuming (a) motion with constant speed, (b) motion with constant acceleration, (c) motion with constant acceleration with a speed limit, and (d) motion along two segments with constant speed. Our results show that assuming motion with constant speed or constant acceleration without a limit on the achievable speed is particularly inappropriate for an accurate distinction between reachable and unreachable locations. Motion along two segments of constant speed provides by far the highest accuracy among the tested models and serves as an efficient and accurate approximation of real-world player motion.			arxiv	['J.

339	Characterizing player's playing styles based on Player Vectors for each playing position in the Chinese Football Super League	Yuesen Li	2022-05-05 16:05:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02731v2	Characterizing playing style is important for football clubs on scouting, monitoring and match preparation. Previous studies considered a player's style as a combination of technical performances, failing to consider the spatial information. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the playing styles of each playing position in the Chinese Football Super League (CSL) matches, integrating a recently adopted Player Vectors framework. Data of 960 matches from 2016-2019 CSL were used. Match ratings, and ten types of match events with the corresponding coordinates for all the lineup players whose on-pitch time exceeded 45 minutes were extracted. Players were first clustered into 8 positions. A player vector was constructed for each player in each match based on the Player Vectors using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Another NMF process was run on the player vectors to extract different types of playing styles. The resulting player vectors discovered 18 different playing styles in the CSL. Six performance indicators of each style were investigated to observe their contributions. In general, the playing styles of forwards and midfielders are in line with football performance evolution trends, while the styles of defenders should be reconsidered. Multifunctional playing styles were also found in high rated CSL players.			arxiv	['Shouxin Zong', 'Yanfei Shen', 'Zhiqiang Pu', 'Miguel-Ángel Gómez', 'Yixiong Cui']	90.0
340	Identifying and Extracting Football Features from Real-World Media Sources using Only Synthetic Training Data	Jose Cerqueira Fernandes	2022-09-27 08:48:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13254v1	Real-world images used for training machine learning algorithms are often unstructured and inconsistent. The process of analysing and tagging these images can be costly and error prone (also availability, gaps and legal conundrums). However, as we demonstrate in this article, the potential to generate accurate graphical images that are indistinguishable from real-world sources has a multitude of benefits in machine learning paradigms. One such example of this is football data from broadcast services (television and other streaming media sources). The football games are usually recorded from multiple sources (cameras and phones) and resolutions, not to mention, occlusion of visual details and other artefacts (like blurring, weathering and lighting conditions) which make it difficult to accurately identify features. We demonstrate an approach which is able to overcome these limitations using generated tagged and structured images. The generated images are able to simulate a variety views and conditions (including noise and blurring) which may only occur sporadically in real-world data and make it difficult for machine learning algorithm to 'cope' with these unforeseen problems in real-data. This approach enables us to rapidly train and prepare a robust solution that accurately extracts features (e.g., spacial locations, markers on the pitch, player positions, ball location and camera FOV) from real-world football match sources for analytical purposes.			arxiv	['Benjamin Kenwright']	91.0
341	Betting the system: Using lineups to predict football scores	George Peters	2022-10-12 15:47:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06327v3	This paper aims to reduce randomness in football by analysing the role of lineups in final scores using machine learning prediction models we have developed. Football clubs invest millions of dollars on lineups and knowing how individual statistics translate to better outcomes can optimise investments. Moreover, sports betting is growing exponentially and being able to predict the future is profitable and desirable. We use machine learning models and historical player data from English Premier League (2020-2022) to predict scores and to understand how individual performance can improve the outcome of a match. We compared different prediction techniques to maximise the possibility of finding useful models. We created heuristic and machine learning models predicting football scores to compare different techniques. We used different sets of features and shown goalkeepers stats are more important than attackers stats to predict goals scored. We applied a broad evaluation process to assess the efficacy of the models in real world applications. We managed to predict correctly all relegated teams after forecast 100 consecutive matches. We show that Support Vector Regression outperformed other techniques predicting final scores and that lineups do not improve predictions. Finally, our model was profitable (42% return) when emulating a betting system using real world odds data.			arxiv	['Diogo Pacheco']	92.0
342	Partially Constrained Group Variable Selection to Adjust for Complementary Unit Performance in American College Football	Andrey Skripnikov	2022-10-22 18:38:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12519v1	Given the importance of accurate team rankings in American college football (CFB) -- due to heavy title and playoff implications -- strides have been made to improve evaluation metrics across statistical categories, going from basic averages (e.g. points scored per game) to metrics that adjust for a team's strength of schedule, but one aspect that hasn't been emphasized is the complementary nature of American football. Despite the same team's offensive and defensive units typically consisting of separate player sets, some aspects of your team's defensive (offensive) performance may affect the complementary side: turnovers forced by your defense could lead to easier scoring chances for your offense, while your offense's ability to control the clock may help your defense. For 2009-2019 CFB seasons, we incorporate natural splines with group penalty approaches to identify the most consistently influential features of complementary football in a data-driven way, conducting partially constrained optimization in order to additionally guarantee the full adjustment for strength of schedule and homefield factor. We touch on the issues arising due to reverse-causal nature of certain within-game dynamics, discussing several potential remedies. Lastly, game outcome prediction performances are compared across several ranking adjustment approaches for method validation purposes.			arxiv	[]	93.0
343	Design and Implementation of A Soccer Ball Detection System with Multiple Cameras	Lei Li	2023-01-31 22:04:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00123v1	The detection of small and medium-sized objects in three dimensions has always been a frontier exploration problem. This technology has a very wide application in sports analysis, games, virtual reality, human animation and other fields. The traditional three-dimensional small target detection technology has the disadvantages of high cost, low precision and inconvenience, so it is difficult to apply in practice. With the development of machine learning and deep learning, the technology of computer vision algorithms is becoming more mature. Creating an immersive media experience is considered to be a very important research work in sports. The main work is to explore and solve the problem of football detection under the multiple cameras, aiming at the research and implementation of the live broadcast system of football matches. Using multi cameras detects a target ball and determines its position in three dimension with the occlusion, motion, low illumination of the target object. This paper designed and implemented football detection system under multiple cameras for the detection and capture of targets in real-time matches. The main work mainly consists of three parts, football detector, single camera detection, and multi-cameras detection. The system used bundle adjustment to obtain the three-dimensional position of the target, and the GPU to accelerates data pre-processing and achieve accurate real-time capture of the target. By testing the system, it shows that the system can accurately detect and capture the moving targets in 3D. In addition, the solution in this paper is reusable for large-scale competitions, like basketball and soccer. The system framework can be well transplanted into other similar engineering project systems. It has been put into the market.			arxiv	['Tianfang Zhang', 'Zhongfeng Kang', 'Wenhan Zhang']	94.0
344	Impact of velocity and impact angle on football shot accuracy during fundamental trainings	Rahman Sahinler	2023-02-07 12:24:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03426v1	The purpose of this research is to create a machine learning-based smart coaching approach for football that can replace manual analysis with real-time feedback for trainers. In-depth analysis of football player data by humans is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires a lot of effort. This exploratory study demonstrates the feasibility of using a machine learning algorithm to enhance the effectiveness of player monitoring and training. The suggested approach uses machine learning to generate analytical insights and enable long-term monitoring of player performance. In the future, machine learning could use this technique to offer constructive criticism of football players. The system incorporates a homemade ball-throwing mechanism capable of launching the ball in a variety of directions and at varying velocities. The ball kicker is equipped with a gyroscope and accelerometer sensors for measuring velocity and acceleration. The gathered data is filtered initially, and then the data that has been processed is fed into the machine-learning algorithm. The algorithm will be trained on player performance data and will be able to provide real-time feedback to coaches on player performance and potential areas for improvement. Additionally, the system will be able to track player progress over time and provide coaches with a comprehensive view of player development. The ultimate goal is to improve player performance and reduce the workload for coaches by automating the analysis process.			arxiv	['Omer Burak Goktas', 'Berkay Mumcu', 'Damla Sen', 'Feyza Kocaturk', 'Huseyin Uvet']	95.0
345	Deep Generative Multi-Agent Imitation Model as a Computational Benchmark for Evaluating Human Performance in Complex Interactive Tasks: A Case Study in Football	Chaoyi Gu	2023-03-23 15:01:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13323v1	Evaluating the performance of human is a common need across many applications, such as in engineering and sports. When evaluating human performance in completing complex and interactive tasks, the most common way is to use a metric having been proved efficient for that context, or to use subjective measurement techniques. However, this can be an error prone and unreliable process since static metrics cannot capture all the complex contexts associated with such tasks and biases exist in subjective measurement. The objective of our research is to create data-driven AI agents as computational benchmarks to evaluate human performance in solving difficult tasks involving multiple humans and contextual factors. We demonstrate this within the context of football performance analysis. We train a generative model based on Conditional Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) Model on a large player and ball tracking dataset. The trained model is used to imitate the interactions between two teams and predict the performance from each team. Then the trained Conditional VRNN Model is used as a benchmark to evaluate team performance. The experimental results on Premier League football dataset demonstrates the usefulness of our method to existing state-of-the-art static metric used in football analytics.			arxiv	['Varuna De Silva']	96.0
346	Here Comes the STRAIN: Analyzing Defensive Pass Rush in American Football with Player Tracking Data	Quang Nguyen	2023-05-17 14:52:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10262v3	In American football, a pass rush is an attempt by the defensive team to disrupt the offense and prevent the quarterback (QB) from completing a pass. Existing metrics for assessing pass rush performance are either discrete-time quantities or based on subjective judgment. Using player tracking data, we propose STRAIN, a novel metric for evaluating pass rushers in the National Football League (NFL) at the continuous-time within-play level. Inspired by the concept of strain rate in materials science, STRAIN is a simple and interpretable means for measuring defensive pressure in football. It is a directly-observed statistic as a function of two features: the distance between the pass rusher and QB, and the rate at which this distance is being reduced. Our metric possesses great predictability of pressure and stability over time. We also fit a multilevel model for STRAIN to understand the defensive pressure contribution of every pass rusher at the play-level. We apply our approach to NFL data and present results for the first eight weeks of the 2021 regular season. In particular, we provide comparisons of STRAIN for different defensive positions and play outcomes, and rankings of the NFL's best pass rushers according to our metric.			arxiv	['Ronald Yurko', 'Gregory J.

347	A network-based ranking system for American college football	Juyong Park	2005-05-24 17:07:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505169v4	American college football faces a conflict created by the desire to stage national championship games between the best teams of a season when there is no conventional playoff system to decide which those teams are. Instead, ranking of teams is based on their record of wins and losses during the season, but each team plays only a small fraction of eligible opponents, making the system underdetermined or contradictory or both. It is an interesting challenge to create a ranking system that at once is mathematically well-founded, gives results in general accord with received wisdom concerning the relative strengths of the teams, and is based upon intuitive principles, allowing it to be accepted readily by fans and experts alike. Here we introduce a one-parameter ranking method that satisfies all of these requirements and is based on a network representation of college football schedules.			arxiv	['M. E. J. Newman']	98.0

It turns out that in particular the tails of the distributions are not well described by independent Bernoulli trials, but rather well modeled by negative binomial or generalized extreme value distributions. To understand this behavior from first principles, we suggest to modify the Bernoulli random process to include a simple component of self-affirmation which seems to describe the data surprisingly well and allows to interpret the observed deviation from Gaussian statistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood as special cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score data from many leagues in Europe as well as from international tournaments and found the proposed models to be applicable rather universally. In particular, here we compare men's and women's leagues and the separate German leagues during the cold war times and find some remarkable differences.			arxiv	['Andreas Nussbaumer', 'Wolfhard Janke', 'Martin Weigel']	99.0

Moss	2012-04-12 15:18:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2753v1	We use computational simulations to compare the impact response of different football and U.S. Army helmet pad materials. We conduct experiments to characterize the material response of different helmet pads. We simulate experimental helmet impact tests performed by the U.S. Army to validate our methods. We then simulate a cylindrical impactor striking different pads. The acceleration history of the impactor is used to calculate the Head Injury Criterion for each pad. We conduct sensitivity studies exploring the effects of pad composition, geometry, and material stiffness. We find that: (1) The football pad materials do not outperform the currently used military pad material in militarily-relevant impact scenarios; (2) Optimal material properties for a pad depend on impact energy; and (3) Thicker pads perform better at all velocities. Our analysis suggests that by using larger helmet shells with correspondingly thicker pads, impact-induced traumatic brain injury may be significantly reduced.

The algorithm starts with an initial population including three different groups of teams: the wealthiest (strongest), the regular, the poorest (weakest). Each individual of population constitute a football team while each player is an indication of a player in a post. The optimization can hopefully occurs when the competition among the teams in all the leagues is imitated as the strongest teams usually purchase the best players of the regular teams and in turn, regular teams purchase the best players of the weakest who should always discover young players instead of buying professionals. It has been shown that the algorithm can hopefully converge to an acceptable solution solving various benchmarks. Key words: Heuristic Algorithms			arxiv	[]	101.0

In this paper we analyse the available data on football world championships since 1930 until today. Our goal is to rank the national teams based on all matches during the championships. For this purpose, we apply the PageRank with restarts algorithm to a graph built from the games played during the tournaments. Several statistics such as matches won and goals scored are combined in different metrics that assign weights to the links in the graph. Finally, our results indicate that the Random walk approach with the use of right metrics can indeed produce relevant rankings comparable to the FIFA official all-time ranking board.			arxiv	['Lasko Basnarkov']	102.0
352	MORE: Merged Opinions Reputation Model	Nardine Osman	2015-03-31 14:39:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.09066v1	Reputation is generally defined as the opinion of a group on an aspect of a thing. This paper presents a reputation model that follows a probabilistic modelling of opinions based on three main concepts: (1) the value of an opinion decays with time, (2) the reputation of the opinion source impacts the reliability of the opinion, and (3) the certainty of the opinion impacts its weight with respect to other opinions. Furthermore, the model is flexible with its opinion sources: it may use explicit opinions or implicit opinions that can be extracted from agent behavior in domains where explicit opinions are sparse. We illustrate the latter with an approach to extract opinions from behavioral information in the sports domain, focusing on football in particular. One of the uses of a reputation model is predicting behavior. We take up the challenge of predicting the behavior of football teams in football matches, which we argue is a very interesting yet difficult approach for evaluating the model.			arxiv	['Alessandro Provetti', 'Valerio Riggi', 'Carles Sierra']	103.0

A passing motif analysis of football players	Javier López Peña	2015-06-23 16:25:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07768v1	"Traditionally, most of football statistical and media coverage has been focused almost exclusively on goals and (ocassionally) shots. However, most of the duration of a football game is spent away from the boxes, passing the ball around. The way teams pass the ball around is the most characteristic measurement of what a team's ""unique style"" is. In the present work we analyse passing sequences at the player level, using the different passing frequencies as a ""digital fingerprint"" of a player's style. The resulting numbers provide an adequate feature set which can be used in order to construct a measure of similarity between players. Armed with such a similarity tool, one can try to answer the question: Who might possibly replace Xavi at FC Barcelona?"			arxiv	['Raúl Sánchez Navarro']	104.0

However, the quantification of competitive balance is not an easy task. The difficulties are mainly associated with its multi-dimensionality character as well as the structure of each particular sport. This article uses data from eight domestic leagues over 60 years to identify the best index for a holistic view of competitive balance in European football. The findings support the longstanding Uncertainty of Outcome Hypothesis using indices designed for the important three identified levels of competition and offering a weighting pattern for ranking places. Important conclusions may be derived concerning the relative importance of different aspects of competitive balance depending on the specific features of the best index.			arxiv	['Ioannis Ntzoufras', 'James Reade']	105.0

The proposed method is fully automatic in contrast to the current state of the art which requires manual initialization of point correspondences between the image and the static model. Automatic registration using existing approaches has been difficult due to the lack of sufficient point correspondences. We investigate an alternate approach exploiting the edge information from the line markings on the field. We formulate the registration problem as a nearest neighbour search over a synthetically generated dictionary of edge map and homography pairs. The synthetic dictionary generation allows us to exhaustively cover a wide variety of camera angles and positions and reduce this problem to a minimal per-frame edge map matching procedure. We show that the per-frame results can be improved in videos using an optimization framework for temporal camera stabilization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting extensive results on a dataset collected from matches of football World Cup 2014.			arxiv	['Bharath Bhat', 'Vineet Gandhi', 'C. V.

The method is implemented in the R add-on package GJRM and allows for modelling linear and non-linear dependence through the use of several copulae. Moreover, the parameters of the marginal distributions of the count responses and of the copula can be specified as flexible functions of covariates. Motivated by a football application, we also discuss an extension which forces the regression coefficients of the marginal (linear) predictors to be equal via a suitable penalisation. Model fitting is based on a trust region algorithm which estimates simultaneously all the parameters of the joint models. We investigate the proposal's empirical performance in two simulation studies, the first one designed for arbitrary count data, the other one reflecting football-specific settings. Finally, the method is applied to FIFA World Cup data, showing its competitiveness to the standard approach with regard to predictive performance.			arxiv	['Andreas Groll', 'Thomas Kneib', 'Giampiero Marra', 'Rosalba Radice']	109.0

Building upon this, we develop algorithms to optimise team formation and in-game tactics with different objectives. Empirical evaluation of our approach on real-world datasets from 760 matches shows that by using optimised tactics from our Bayesian and stochastic games, we can increase a team chances of winning by up to 16.1\% and 3.4\% respectively.			arxiv	['Georgios Chalkiadakis', 'Timothy J.

Specifically, we are concerned about the re-start of the Spanish national football league, La Liga, which is currently -May 2020- stopped with 11 fixtures remaining. Our model includes two additional states of an individual, confined and quarantined, which are reached when an individual presents COVID-19 symptoms or has undergone a virus test with a positive result. The model also accounts for the interaction dynamics of players, considering three different sources of infection: the player social circle, the contact with his/her team colleagues during training sessions, and the interaction with rivals during a match. Our results highlight the influence of the days between matches, the frequency of virus tests and their sensitivity on the number of players infected at the end of the season. Following our findings, we finally present a variety of strategies to minimize the probability that COVID-19 propagates in case the season of La Liga was re-started after the current lockdown.			arxiv	['Daniel R.

However, existing orientation estimation methods, which are based on computer-vision techniques, still have a lot of room for improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this article presents the first deep learning model for estimating orientation directly from video footage. By approaching this challenge as a classification problem where classes correspond to orientation bins, and by introducing a cyclic loss function, a well-known convolutional network is refined to provide player orientation data. The model is trained by using ground-truth orientation data obtained from wearable EPTS devices, which are individually compensated with respect to the perceived orientation in the current frame. The obtained results outperform previous methods; in particular, the absolute median error is less than 12 degrees per player. An ablation study is included in order to show the potential generalization to any kind of football video footage.			arxiv	['Adrián Martín', 'Paulino Granero', 'Coloma Ballester', 'Gloria Haro']	114.0

Using Deep Learning to Value Defensive Actions in Football Event-Data	Charbel Merhej	2021-06-03 12:18:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01786v1	Objectively quantifying the value of player actions in football (soccer) is a challenging problem. To date, studies in football analytics have mainly focused on the attacking side of the game, while there has been less work on event-driven metrics for valuing defensive actions (e.g., tackles and interceptions). Therefore in this paper, we use deep learning techniques to define a novel metric that values such defensive actions by studying the threat of passages of play that preceded them. By doing so, we are able to value defensive actions based on what they prevented from happening in the game. Our Defensive Action Expected Threat (DAxT) model has been validated using real-world event-data from the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 English Premier League seasons, and we combine our model outputs with additional features to derive an overall rating of defensive ability for players. Overall, we find that our model is able to predict the impact of defensive actions allowing us to better value defenders using event-data.			arxiv	['Ryan Beal', 'Sarvapali Ramchurn', 'Tim Matthews']	115.0
365	Effect of Key Match Events on Football Passmaps	Vid Stropnik	2021-08-11 17:49:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05343v1	A team of association football players may be envisioned as a directed network with player nodes and weighted pass edges. Such a simplistic representation of an otherwise complex structure yields several benefits, but also permits the application of well-established network analysis approaches, to gain insights into the match flow. The authors of this work propose the application of these, including centrality measures, community detection methods, and the analysis of induced subgraphs, to analyze the potential effects certain match events have on the team. In addition to reporting on their findings, they emphasize their work's contribution of over 9000 novel football network representations to the Network Analysis community.			arxiv	['Vuk Đuranović', 'Maruša Oražem']	116.0
366	Analyzing the Behavior of Soccer Fans from a Mobile Phone Network Perspective: Euro 2016, a Case Study	Gergő Pintér	2021-08-17 13:07:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09291v1	In this study, we analyzed one month of Call Detail Records, covering Budapest in June, 2016. During this observation period, the 2016 UEFA European Football Championship took place, where the Hungarian national football team did well, beyond expectations. This case study focuses on the fans' behavior in Budapest, during and after the Hungarian matches, from the perspective of the mobile phone network data. Tense rooting, joy of scoring a goal, self-forgetting celebration because of winning the group. All of these have an effect on the data, that can be simply revealed. We used descriptive statistical methods to analyze the available data set, and managed to demonstrate the potential of this kind of data at social sensing. We found that the mobile phone network activity reflects the football fans' behavior, even if the match is played in another country.			arxiv	['Imre Felde']	117.0
367	Clustering of football players based on performance data and aggregated clustering validity indexes	Serhat Akhanli	2022-04-20 21:46:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09793v1	We analyse football (soccer) player performance data with mixed type variables from the 2014-15 season of eight European major leagues. We cluster these data based on a tailor-made dissimilarity measure. In order to decide between the many available clustering methods and to choose an appropriate number of clusters, we use the approach by Akhanli and Hennig (2020). This is based on several validation criteria that refer to different desirable characteristics of a clustering. These characteristics are chosen based on the aim of clustering, and this allows to define a suitable validation index as weighted average of calibrated individual indexes measuring the desirable features. We derive two different clusterings. The first one is a partition of the data set into major groups of essentially different players, which can be used for the analysis of a team's composition. The second one divides the data set into many small clusters (with 10 players on average), which can be used for finding players with a very similar profile to a given player. It is discussed in depth what characteristics are desirable for these clusterings. Weighting the criteria for the second clustering is informed by a survey of football experts.			arxiv	['Christian Hennig']	118.0
368	The Second-Order Football-Pool Problem and the Optimal Rate of Generalized-Covering Codes	Dor Elimelech	2022-10-02 14:23:10	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00531v1	The goal of the classic football-pool problem is to determine how many lottery tickets are to be bought in order to guarantee at least $n-r$ correct guesses out of a sequence of $n$ games played. We study a generalized (second-order) version of this problem, in which any of these $n$ games consists of two sub-games. The second-order version of the football-pool problem is formulated using the notion of generalized-covering radius, recently proposed as a fundamental property of linear codes. We consider an extension of this property to general (not necessarily linear) codes, and provide an asymptotic solution to our problem by finding the optimal rate function of second-order covering codes given a fixed normalized covering radius. We also prove that the fraction of second-order covering codes among codes of sufficiently large rate tends to $1$ as the code length tends to $\infty$.			arxiv	['Moshe Schwartz']	119.0
369	Going for GOAL: A Resource for Grounded Football Commentaries	Alessandro Suglia	2022-11-08 20:04:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04534v1	Recent video+language datasets cover domains where the interaction is highly structured, such as instructional videos, or where the interaction is scripted, such as TV shows. Both of these properties can lead to spurious cues to be exploited by models rather than learning to ground language. In this paper, we present GrOunded footbAlL commentaries (GOAL), a novel dataset of football (or `soccer') highlights videos with transcribed live commentaries in English. As the course of a game is unpredictable, so are commentaries, which makes them a unique resource to investigate dynamic language grounding. We also provide state-of-the-art baselines for the following tasks: frame reordering, moment retrieval, live commentary retrieval and play-by-play live commentary generation. Results show that SOTA models perform reasonably well in most tasks. We discuss the implications of these results and suggest new tasks for which GOAL can be used. Our codebase is available at: https://gitlab.com/grounded-sport-convai/goal-baselines.			arxiv	['José Lopes', 'Emanuele Bastianelli', 'Andrea Vanzo', 'Shubham Agarwal', 'Malvina Nikandrou', 'Lu Yu', 'Ioannis Konstas', 'Verena Rieser']	120.0
370	Location analysis of players in UEFA EURO 2020 and 2022 using generalized valuation of defense by estimating probabilities	Rikuhei Umemoto	2022-11-30 12:43:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00021v1	Analyzing defenses in team sports is generally challenging because of the limited event data. Researchers have previously proposed methods to evaluate football team defense by predicting the events of ball gain and being attacked using locations of all players and the ball. However, they did not consider the importance of the events, assumed the perfect observation of all 22 players, and did not fully investigated the influence of the diversity (e.g., nationality and sex). Here, we propose a generalized valuation method of defensive teams by score-scaling the predicted probabilities of the events. Using the open-source location data of all players in broadcast video frames in football games of men's Euro 2020 and women's Euro 2022, we investigated the effect of the number of players on the prediction and validated our approach by analyzing the games. Results show that for the predictions of being attacked, scoring, and conceding, all players' information was not necessary, while that of ball gain required information on three to four offensive and defensive players. With game analyses we explained the excellence in defense of finalist teams in Euro 2020. Our approach might be applicable to location data from broadcast video frames in football games.			arxiv	['Kazushi Tsutsui', 'Keisuke Fujii']	121.0
371	Optimal selection of the starting lineup for a football team	Soudeep Deb	2023-03-22 08:49:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12385v2	The success of a football team depends on various individual skills and performances of the selected players as well as how cohesively they perform. We propose a two-stage process for selecting optimal playing eleven of a football team from its pool of available players. In the first stage a LASSO-induced modified multinomial logistic regression model is derived to analyse the probabilities of the three possible outcomes. The model considers strengths of the players in the team as well as those of the opponent, home advantage, and also the effects of individual players and player combinations beyond the recorded performances of these players. In the second stage, a GRASP-type meta-heuristic is implemented for the team selection which maximises its probability of winning. The work is illustrated with English Premier League data from 2008/09 to 2015/16. The application demonstrates that the model in the first stage furnishes valuable insights about the deciding factors for different teams whereas the optimisation steps can be effectively used to determine the best possible starting lineup under various circumstances. We propose a measure of efficiency in team selection by the team management and analyse the performance of the teams on this front.			arxiv	['Shubhabrata Das']	122.0

The valuation model leverages a ""passing matrix"" to encapsulate player interactions on the field, utilizing centrality measures to quantify individual influence. Unlike traditional approaches, this model is both metric-driven and cohort-free, providing a dynamic and individualized framework for ascertaining a player's fair market value. The methodology is empirically validated through a case study in European football, employing real-world match and financial data. The paper advances the disciplines of sports analytics and financial mathematics by offering a cross-disciplinary mechanism for player valuation, and also links together two well-known econometric methods in marginal revenue product and expected present valuation."			arxiv	['Jimmy Risk']	123.0
373	Protocol for an Observational Study on the Effects of Playing High School Football on Later Life Cognitive Functioning and Mental Health	Sameer K. Deshpande	2016-07-06 19:37:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01756v1	A potential causal relationship between head injuries sustained by NFL players and later-life neurological decline may have broad implications for participants in youth and high school football programs. However, brain trauma risk at the professional level may be different than that at the youth and high school levels and the long-term effects of participation at these levels is as-yet unclear. To investigate the effect of playing high school football on later life depression and cognitive functioning, we propose a retrospective observational study using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) of graduates from Wisconsin high schools in 1957. We compare 1,153 high school males who played varsity football to 2,751 male students who did not. 1,951 of the control subjects did not play any sport and the remaining 800 controls played a non-contact sport. We focus on two primary outcomes measured at age 65: a composite cognitive outcome measuring verbal fluency and memory and the modified CES-D depression score. To control for potential confounders we adjust for pre-exposure covariates such as IQ with matching and model-based covariate adjustment. We will conduct an ordered testing procedure that uses all 2,751 controls while controlling for possible unmeasured differences between students who played sports and those who did not. We will quantitatively assess the sensitivity of the results to potential unmeasured confounding. The study will also consider several secondary outcomes of clinical interest such as aggression and heavy drinking. The rich set of pre-exposure variables, relatively unbiased sampling, and longitudinal nature of the WLS dataset make the proposed analysis unique among related studies that rely primarily on convenience samples of football players with reported neurological symptoms.			arxiv	['Raiden B.

374	Large Scale Diverse Combinatorial Optimization: ESPN Fantasy Football Player Trades	Aaron Baughman	2021-11-04 13:39:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02859v3	Even skilled fantasy football managers can be disappointed by their mid-season rosters as some players inevitably fall short of draft day expectations. Team managers can quickly discover that their team has a low score ceiling even if they start their best active players. A novel and diverse combinatorial optimization system proposes high volume and unique player trades between complementary teams to balance trade fairness. Several algorithms create the valuation of each fantasy football player with an ensemble of computing models: Quantum Support Vector Classifier with Permutation Importance (QSVC-PI), Quantum Support Vector Classifier with Accumulated Local Effects (QSVC-ALE), Variational Quantum Circuit with Permutation Importance (VQC-PI), Hybrid Quantum Neural Network with Permutation Importance (HQNN-PI), eXtreme Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGB), and Subject Matter Expert (SME) rules. The valuation of each player is personalized based on league rules, roster, and selections. The cost of trading away a player is related to a team's roster, such as the depth at a position, slot count, and position importance. Teams are paired together for trading based on a cosine dissimilarity score so that teams can offset their strengths and weaknesses. A knapsack 0-1 algorithm computes outgoing players for each team. Postprocessors apply analytics and deep learning models to measure 6 different objective measures about each trade. Over the 2020 and 2021 National Football League (NFL) seasons, a group of 24 experts from IBM and ESPN evaluated trade quality through 10 Football Error Analysis Tool (FEAT) sessions. Our system started with 76.9% of high-quality trades and was deployed for the 2021 season with 97.3% of high-quality trades. To increase trade quantity, our quantum, classical, and rules-based computing have 100% trade uniqueness. We use Qiskit's quantum simulators throughout our work.			arxiv	['Daniel Bohm', 'Micah Forster', 'Eduardo Morales', 'Jeff Powell', 'Shaun McPartlin', 'Raja Hebbar', 'Kavitha Yogaraj', 'Yoshika Chhabra', 'Sudeep Ghosh', 'Rukhsan Ul Haq', 'Arjun Kashyap']	125.0
375	Robust analysis of second-leg home advantage in UEFA football through better nonparametric confidence intervals for binary regression functions	Gery Geenens	2017-01-26 02:49:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07555v1	In international football (soccer), two-legged knockout ties, with each team playing at home in one leg and the final outcome decided on aggregate, are common. Many players, managers and followers seem to believe in the `second-leg home advantage', i.e. that it is beneficial to play at home on the second leg. A more complex effect than the usual and well-established home advantage, it is harder to identify, and previous statistical studies did not prove conclusive about its actuality. Yet, given the amount of money handled in international football competitions nowadays, the question of existence or otherwise of this effect is of real import. As opposed to previous research, this paper addresses it from a purely nonparametric perspective and brings a very objective answer, not based on any particular model specification which could orientate the analysis in one or the other direction. Along the way, the paper reviews the well-known shortcomings of the Wald confidence interval for a proportion, suggests new nonparametric confidence intervals for conditional probability functions, revisits the problem of the bias when building confidence intervals in nonparametric regression, and provides a novel bootstrap-based solution to it. Finally, the new intervals are used in a careful analysis of game outcome data for the UEFA Champions and Europa leagues from 2009/10 to 2014/15. A slight `second-leg home advantage' is evidenced.			arxiv	['Thomas Cuddihy']	126.0
376	Predictive modelling of training loads and injury in Australian football	David L. Carey	2017-06-14 07:09:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04336v1	To investigate whether training load monitoring data could be used to predict injuries in elite Australian football players, data were collected from elite athletes over 3 seasons at an Australian football club. Loads were quantified using GPS devices, accelerometers and player perceived exertion ratings. Absolute and relative training load metrics were calculated for each player each day (rolling average, exponentially weighted moving average, acute:chronic workload ratio, monotony and strain). Injury prediction models (regularised logistic regression, generalised estimating equations, random forests and support vector machines) were built for non-contact, non-contact time-loss and hamstring specific injuries using the first two seasons of data. Injury predictions were generated for the third season and evaluated using the area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUC). Predictive performance was only marginally better than chance for models of non-contact and non-contact time-loss injuries (AUC$<$0.65). The best performing model was a multivariate logistic regression for hamstring injuries (best AUC=0.76). Learning curves suggested logistic regression was underfitting the load-injury relationship and that using a more complex model or increasing the amount of model building data may lead to future improvements. Injury prediction models built using training load data from a single club showed poor ability to predict injuries when tested on previously unseen data, suggesting they are limited as a daily decision tool for practitioners. Focusing the modelling approach on specific injury types and increasing the amount of training data may lead to the development of improved predictive models for injury prevention.			arxiv	['Kok-Leong Ong', 'Rod Whiteley', 'Kay M.

377	Passive Cervical Spine Ligaments Provide Stability during Head Impacts in Vivo	Calvin Kuo	2019-04-02 18:17:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03102v1	It has long been suggested that neck muscle strength and anticipatory cocontraction can decrease head motions during head impacts. Here, we quantify the relative angular impulse contributions of neck soft tissue to head stabilization using a musculoskeletal model with Hill-type muscles and rate-dependent ligaments. We simulated sagittal extension and lateral flexion mild experimental head impacts performed on 10 subjects with relaxed or cocontracted muscles, and median American football head impacts. We estimated angular impulses from active muscle, passive muscle, and ligaments during head impact acceleration and deceleration phases. During the acceleration phase, active musculature produced resistive angular impulses that were 30% of the impact angular impulse in experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. This was reduced below 20% in football impacts. During the deceleration phase, active musculature stabilized the head with 50% of the impact angular impulse in experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. However, passive ligaments provided greater stabilizing angular impulses in football impacts. The redistribution of stabilizing angular impulses results from ligament and muscle dependence on lengthening rate, where ligaments stiffen substantially compared to active muscle at high lengthening rates. Thus, ligaments provide relatively greater deceleration impulses in these impacts, which limits the effectiveness of muscle strengthening or anticipated activations.			arxiv	['Jodie Sheffels', 'Michael Fanton', 'Ina Bianca Yu', 'Rosa Hamalainen', 'David Camarillo']	128.0
378	Alterations in Structural Correlation Networks with Prior Concussion in Collision-Sport Athletes	Muhammad Usman Sadiq	2019-04-18 17:34:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10924v1	Several studies have used structural correlation networks, derived from anatomical covariance of brain regions, to analyze neurologic changes associated with multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia and breast cancer [1][2]. Graph-theoretical analyses of human brain structural networks have consistently shown the characteristic of small-worldness that reflects a network with both high segregation and high integration. A large neuroimaging literature on football players, with and without history of concussion, has shown both functional and anatomical changes. Here we use graph-based topological properties of anatomical correlation networks to study the effect of prior concussion in collision-sport athletes. 40 high school collision-sport athletes (23 male football, 17 female soccer; CSA) without self-reported history of concussion (HOC-), 18 athletes (13 male football, 5 female soccer) with self-reported history of concussion (HOC+) and 24 healthy controls (19 male, 5 female; CN) participated in imaging sessions before the beginning of a competition season. The extracted residual volumes for each group were used for building the correlation networks and their small-worldness, , is calculated. The small-worldness of CSA without prior history of concussion, , is significantly greater than that of controls, . CSA with prior history have significantly higher (vs. 95% confidence interval) small-worldness compared to HOC+, over a range of network densities. The longer path lengths in HOC+ group could indicate disrupted neuronal integration relative to healthy controls.			arxiv	['Diana Svaldi', 'Trey Shenk', 'Evan Breedlove', 'Victoria Poole', 'Greg Tamer', 'Kausar Abbas', 'Thomas Talavage']	129.0

Comparing the Information Content of Games in the Four Major US Sports	Julian Wolfson	2015-01-28 16:31:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07179v1	"In the four major North American professional sports (baseball, basketball, football, and hockey), the primary purpose of the regular season is to determine which teams most deserve to advance to the playoffs. Interestingly, while the ultimate goal of identifying the best teams is the same, the number of regular season games played differs dramatically between the sports, ranging from 16 (football) to 82 (basketball and hockey) to 162 (baseball). Though length of season is partially determined by many factors including travel logistics, rest requirements, playoff structure and television contracts, it is hard to reconcile the 10-fold difference in the number of games between, for example, the NFL and MLB unless football games are somehow more ""informative"" than baseball games. In this paper, we aim to quantify the amount of information games yield about the relative strength of the teams involved. Our strategy is to assess how well simple paired comparison models fitted from $X%$ of the games within a season predict the outcomes of the remaining $(100-X)%$ of games, for multiple values of $X$. We compare the resulting predictive accuracy curves between seasons within the same sport and across all four sports, and find dramatic differences in the amount of information yielded by individual game results in the four major U.S. sports."			arxiv	['Joseph S.

380	Evaluating probabilistic forecasts of football matches: The case against the Ranked Probability Score	Edward Wheatcroft	2019-08-23 19:04:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08980v1	A scoring rule is a function of a probabilistic forecast and a corresponding outcome that is used to evaluate forecast performance. A wide range of scoring rules have been defined over time and there is some debate as to which are the most appropriate for evaluating the performance of forecasts of sporting events. This paper focuses on forecasts of the outcomes of football matches. The ranked probability score (RPS) is often recommended since it is `sensitive to distance', that is it takes into account the ordering in the outcomes (a home win is `closer' to a draw than it is to an away win, for example). In this paper, this reasoning is disputed on the basis that it adds nothing in terms of the actual aims of using scoring rules. A related property of scoring rules is locality. A scoring rule is local if it only takes the probability placed on the outcome into consideration. Two simulation experiments are carried out in the context of football matches to compare the performance of the RPS, which is non-local and sensitive to distance, the Brier score, which is non-local and insensitive to distance, and the ignorance score, which is local and insensitive to distance. The ignorance score is found to outperform both the RPS and the Brier score, casting doubt on the value of non-locality and sensitivity to distance as properties of scoring rules in this context.			arxiv	[]	131.0
381	"""Does 4-4-2 exist?"" -- An Analytics Approach to Understand and Classify Football Team Formations in Single Match Situations"	Eric Müller-Budack	2019-09-02 16:14:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00412v1	The chances to win a football match can be significantly increased if the right tactic is chosen and the behavior of the opposite team is well anticipated. For this reason, every professional football club employs a team of game analysts. However, at present game performance analysis is done manually and therefore highly time-consuming. Consequently, automated tools to support the analysis process are required. In this context, one of the main tasks is to summarize team formations by patterns such as 4-4-2. In this paper, we introduce an analytics approach that automatically classifies and visualizes the team formation based on the players' position data. We focus on single match situations instead of complete halftimes or matches to provide a more detailed analysis. A detailed analysis of individual match situations depending on ball possession and match segment length is provided. For this purpose, a visual summary is utilized that summarizes the team formation in a match segment. An expert annotation study is conducted that demonstrates 1) the complexity of the task and 2) the usefulness of the visualization of single situations to understand team formations. The suggested classification approach outperforms existing methods for formation classification. In particular, our approach gives insights about the shortcomings of using patterns like 4-4-2 to describe team formations.			arxiv	['Jonas Theiner', 'Robert Rein', 'Ralph Ewerth']	132.0
382	Prevention of Traumatic Brain Injury with Liquid Shock Absorption	Hossein Vahid Alizadeh	2019-10-17 05:47:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07722v1	The discovery that repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can result in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in high risk contact sports has led to increased scrutiny of head protective gear. In this work, we asked if it was physically possible to prevent mTBI in American football with helmets alone. Here, we show that modern helmets of several types are unlikely to prevent mTBI from high speed collisions as might be seen in the NFL, but that introducing liquid as an energy absorbing medium can dramatically reduce the forces of impact across a spectrum of impact severities. We hypothesized that a helmet which transmits a nearly constant force during football impacts is sufficient to reduce biomechanical loading in the brain below the threshold of mTBI. To test this hypothesis, we first show that the optimal impact force transmitted to the head, in terms of brain strain, is in fact a constant force profile. Then, to generate a constant force with a helmet, we implement a computational model of a fluid-based shock absorber that adapts passively to any given impact speed. Computer simulation of head impacts with liquid shock absorption indicate that, at the highest impact speed, the average brain tissue strain is reduced by 27.6% $\pm$ 9.3 compared to existing helmet padding that is available on the market. These simulations are based on the NFL's helmet test protocol and predict that adding liquid shock absorbers could reduce the number of concussions by at least 75%. Taken together, these results suggest that the majority of mTBI in football could be prevented with more efficient helmet technology.			arxiv	['Michael G. Fanton', 'August G.

383	Robustness of football passing networks against continuous node and link removals	Genki Ichinose	2020-03-27 10:05:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13465v2	We can construct passing networks when we regard a player as a node and a pass as a link in football games. Thus, we can analyze the networks by using tools developed in network science. Among various metrics characterizing a network, centrality metrics have often been used to identify key players in a passing network. However, a tolerance to players being marked or passes being blocked in a passing network, namely the robustness of the network, has been poorly understood so far. Because the robustness of a passing network can be connected to the increase of ball possession, it would be deeply related to the outcome of a game. Here, we developed position-dependent passing networks of 45 matches by 18 teams belonging to the Japan Professional Football League. Then, nodes or links were continuously removed from the passing networks by two removal methods so that we could evaluate the robustness of these networks against the removals. The results show that these passing networks commonly contain hubs (key players making passes). Then, we analyzed the most robust networks in detail and found that their full backs increase the robustness by often invoking a heavier emphasis on attack. Moreover, we showed that the robustness of the passing networks and the team performance have a positive correlation.			arxiv	['Tomohiro Tsuchiya', 'Shunsuke Watanabe']	134.0
384	Validation and Comparison of Instrumented Mouthguards for Measuring Head Kinematics and Assessing Brain Deformation in Football Impacts	Yuzhe Liu	2020-08-05 01:41:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01903v2	Because of the relatively rigid coupling between the upper dentition and the skull, instrumented mouthguards have been shown to be a viable way of measuring head impact kinematics for assisting in understanding the underlying biomechanics of concussions. This has led various companies and institutions to further develop instrumented mouthguards. However, their use as a research tool for understanding concussive impacts makes quantification of their accuracy critical, especially given the conflicting results from various recent studies. Here we present a study that uses a pneumatic impactor to deliver impacts characteristic to football to a Hybrid III headform, in order to validate and compare five of the most commonly used instrumented mouthguards. We found that all tested mouthguards gave accurate measurements for the peak angular acceleration (mean relative error, MRE < 13%), the peak angular velocity (MRE < 8%), brain injury criteria values (MRE < 13%) and brain deformation (described as maximum principal strain and fiber strain, calculated by a convolutional neural network based brain model, MRE < 9%). Finally, we found that the accuracy of the measurement varies with the impact locations yet is not sensitive to the impact velocity for the most part.			arxiv	['August G.

385	G-Elo: Generalization of the Elo algorithm by modelling the discretized margin of victory	Leszek Szczecinski	2020-10-20 03:55:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11187v3	In this work we develop a new algorithm for rating of teams (or players) in one-on-one games by exploiting the observed difference of the game-points (such as goals), also known as a margin of victory (MOV). Our objective is to obtain the Elo-style algorithm whose operation is simple to implement and to understand intuitively. This is done in three steps: first, we define the probabilistic model between the teams' skills and the discretized MOV variable: this generalizes the model underpinning the Elo algorithm, where the MOV variable is discretized into three categories (win/loss/draw). Second, with the formal probabilistic model at hand, the optimization required by the maximum likelihood rule is implemented via stochastic gradient; this yields simple on-line equations for the rating updates which are identical in their general form to those characteristic of the Elo algorithm: the main difference lies in the way the scores and the expected scores are defined. Third, we propose a simple method to estimate the coefficients of the model, and thus define the operation of the algorithm; it is done in a closed form using the historical data so the algorithm is tailored to the sport of interest and the coefficients defining its operation are determined in entirely transparent manner. The alternative, optimization-based strategy to find the coefficients is also presented. We show numerical examples based on the results of the association football of the English Premier League and the American football of the National Football League.			arxiv	[]	136.0
386	Time-series Imputation of Temporally-occluded Multiagent Trajectories	Shayegan Omidshafiei	2021-06-08 09:58:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04219v1	In multiagent environments, several decision-making individuals interact while adhering to the dynamics constraints imposed by the environment. These interactions, combined with the potential stochasticity of the agents' decision-making processes, make such systems complex and interesting to study from a dynamical perspective. Significant research has been conducted on learning models for forward-direction estimation of agent behaviors, for example, pedestrian predictions used for collision-avoidance in self-driving cars. However, in many settings, only sporadic observations of agents may be available in a given trajectory sequence. For instance, in football, subsets of players may come in and out of view of broadcast video footage, while unobserved players continue to interact off-screen. In this paper, we study the problem of multiagent time-series imputation, where available past and future observations of subsets of agents are used to estimate missing observations for other agents. Our approach, called the Graph Imputer, uses forward- and backward-information in combination with graph networks and variational autoencoders to enable learning of a distribution of imputed trajectories. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of football matches, using a projective camera module to train and evaluate our model for the off-screen player state estimation setting. We illustrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches, including those hand-crafted for football.			arxiv	['Daniel Hennes', 'Marta Garnelo', 'Eugene Tarassov', 'Zhe Wang', 'Romuald Elie', 'Jerome T.

The most watched American football league in the world is the United States' National Football League (NFL), where every offensive play can be either a run or a pass, and in this work we focus on passes. Many factors can affect the probability of pass completion, such as receiver separation from the nearest defender, distance from receiver to passer, offense formation, among many others. When predicting the completion probability of a pass, it is essential to know who the target of the pass is. By using distance measures between players and the ball, it is possible to calculate empirical probabilities and predict very accurately who the target will be. The big question is: how likely is it for a pass to be completed in an NFL match while the ball is in the air? We developed a machine learning algorithm to answer this based on several predictors. Using data from the 2018 NFL season, we obtained conditional and marginal predictions for pass completion probability based on a random forest model. This is based on a two-stage procedure: first, we calculate the probability of each offensive player being the pass target, then, conditional on the target, we predict completion probability based on the random forest model. Finally, the general completion probability can be calculated using the law of total probability. We present animations for selected plays and show the pass completion probability evolution.			arxiv	['Rafael de Andrade Moral']	138.0
388	Analyzing the Behavior and Financial Status of Soccer Fans from a Mobile Phone Network Perspective: Euro 2016, a Case Study	Gergő Pintér	2021-11-15 11:40:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07685v1	In this study, Call Detail Records (CDRs), covering Budapest, for the month of June in 2016 has been analyzed. During this observation period, the 2016 UEFA European Football Championship took place, which affected significantly the habit of the residents, despite the fact that not a single match was played in the city. We evaluated the fans' behavior in Budapest, during and after the Hungarian matches, and found that the mobile phone network activity reflects the football fans' behavior, demonstrating the potential of mobile phone network data within a social sensing system. The Call Detail Records are enriched with mobile phone properties to analyze the subscribers' devices. Applying the device information (Type Allocation Code) from the activity records, the Subscriber Identity Modules, that do not operate in cell phones are omitted from mobility analyses, allowing to focus on people. The mobile phone price is proposed and evaluated as a socioeconomic indicator, and correlation between the phone price and the mobility customs have been found. We also found that, beside the cell phone price, the subscriber age and the subscription type also have an effect on the mobility. On the other hand, these do not seem to affect the interest in football.			arxiv	['Imre Felde']	139.0
389	A Survey on Video Action Recognition in Sports: Datasets, Methods and Applications	Fei Wu	2022-06-02 13:19:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01038v1	To understand human behaviors, action recognition based on videos is a common approach. Compared with image-based action recognition, videos provide much more information. Reducing the ambiguity of actions and in the last decade, many works focused on datasets, novel models and learning approaches have improved video action recognition to a higher level. However, there are challenges and unsolved problems, in particular in sports analytics where data collection and labeling are more sophisticated, requiring sport professionals to annotate data. In addition, the actions could be extremely fast and it becomes difficult to recognize them. Moreover, in team sports like football and basketball, one action could involve multiple players, and to correctly recognize them, we need to analyse all players, which is relatively complicated. In this paper, we present a survey on video action recognition for sports analytics. We introduce more than ten types of sports, including team sports, such as football, basketball, volleyball, hockey and individual sports, such as figure skating, gymnastics, table tennis, tennis, diving and badminton. Then we compare numerous existing frameworks for sports analysis to present status quo of video action recognition in both team sports and individual sports. Finally, we discuss the challenges and unsolved problems in this area and to facilitate sports analytics, we develop a toolbox using PaddlePaddle, which supports football, basketball, table tennis and figure skating action recognition.			arxiv	['Qingzhong Wang', 'Jian Bian', 'Haoyi Xiong', 'Ning Ding', 'Feixiang Lu', 'Jun Cheng', 'Dejing Dou']	140.0
390	Preliminary Examination of Guardian Cap Head Impact Data Using Instrumented Mouthguards	Kristen G. Quigley	2023-02-21 22:44:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11038v1	Purpose The objective of this study is to present preliminary on-field head kinematics data for NCAA Division I American football players through closely matched pre-season workouts both with and without Guardian Caps (GCs). Methods 42 NCAA Division I American football players wore instrumented mouthguards (iMMs) for 6 closely matched workouts, 3 in traditional helmets (PRE) and 3 with GCs (POST) affixed to the exterior of their helmets. This includes 7 players who had consistent data through all workouts. Results There was no significant difference between the collapsed mean values for the entire sample between PRE and POST for peak linear acceleration (PLA) (PRE=16.3, POST=17.2Gs; p=0.20), Peak Angular Acceleration (PAA) (PRE=992.1, POST=1029.4rad/s2; p=0.51 and the total amount of impacts (PRE=9.3, POST=9.7; p=0.72). Similarly, no difference was observed between PRE and POST for PLA (PRE=16.1, POST=17.2Gs; p=0.32), PAA (PRE=951.2, POST=1038.0rad/s2; p=0.29 and total impacts (PRE=9.6, POST=9.7; p=0.32) between sessions for the 7 repeated players. Conclusion These data suggest no difference in head kinematics data (PLA, PAA and total impacts) when GCs are worn. This study suggests GCs are not effective in reducing the magnitude of head impacts experienced by NCAA Division I American football players.			arxiv	['Dustin Hopfe', 'Madison R.

391	Embedding Contextual Information through Reward Shaping in Multi-Agent Learning: A Case Study from Google Football	Chaoyi Gu	2023-03-25 10:21:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15471v3	Artificial Intelligence has been used to help human complete difficult tasks in complicated environments by providing optimized strategies for decision-making or replacing the manual labour. In environments including multiple agents, such as football, the most common methods to train agents are Imitation Learning and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, the agents trained by Imitation Learning cannot outperform the expert demonstrator, which makes humans hardly get new insights from the learnt policy. Besides, MARL is prone to the credit assignment problem. In environments with sparse reward signal, this method can be inefficient. The objective of our research is to create a novel reward shaping method by embedding contextual information in reward function to solve the aforementioned challenges. We demonstrate this in the Google Research Football (GRF) environment. We quantify the contextual information extracted from game state observation and use this quantification together with original sparse reward to create the shaped reward. The experiment results in the GRF environment prove that our reward shaping method is a useful addition to state-of-the-art MARL algorithms for training agents in environments with sparse reward signal.			arxiv	['Varuna De Silva', 'Corentin Artaud', 'Rafael Pina']	142.0
392	Adaptive action supervision in reinforcement learning from real-world multi-agent demonstrations	Keisuke Fujii	2023-05-22 13:33:37	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13030v4	Modeling of real-world biological multi-agents is a fundamental problem in various scientific and engineering fields. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework to generate flexible and diverse behaviors in cyberspace; however, when modeling real-world biological multi-agents, there is a domain gap between behaviors in the source (i.e., real-world data) and the target (i.e., cyberspace for RL), and the source environment parameters are usually unknown. In this paper, we propose a method for adaptive action supervision in RL from real-world demonstrations in multi-agent scenarios. We adopt an approach that combines RL and supervised learning by selecting actions of demonstrations in RL based on the minimum distance of dynamic time warping for utilizing the information of the unknown source dynamics. This approach can be easily applied to many existing neural network architectures and provide us with an RL model balanced between reproducibility as imitation and generalization ability to obtain rewards in cyberspace. In the experiments, using chase-and-escape and football tasks with the different dynamics between the unknown source and target environments, we show that our approach achieved a balance between the reproducibility and the generalization ability compared with the baselines. In particular, we used the tracking data of professional football players as expert demonstrations in football and show successful performances despite the larger gap between behaviors in the source and target environments than the chase-and-escape task.			arxiv	['Kazushi Tsutsui', 'Atom Scott', 'Hiroshi Nakahara', 'Naoya Takeishi', 'Yoshinobu Kawahara']	143.0
393	A Strategic Framework for Optimal Decisions in Football 1-vs-1 Shot-Taking Situations: An Integrated Approach of Machine Learning, Theory-Based Modeling, and Game Theory	Calvin C. K. Yeung	2023-07-27 09:42:25	http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14732v1	Complex interactions between two opposing agents frequently occur in domains of machine learning, game theory, and other application domains. Quantitatively analyzing the strategies involved can provide an objective basis for decision-making. One such critical scenario is shot-taking in football, where decisions, such as whether the attacker should shoot or pass the ball and whether the defender should attempt to block the shot, play a crucial role in the outcome of the game. However, there are currently no effective data-driven and/or theory-based approaches to analyzing such situations. To address this issue, we proposed a novel framework to analyze such scenarios based on game theory, where we estimate the expected payoff with machine learning (ML) models, and additional features for ML models were extracted with a theory-based shot block model. Conventionally, successes or failures (1 or 0) are used as payoffs, while a success shot (goal) is extremely rare in football. Therefore, we proposed the Expected Probability of Shot On Target (xSOT) metric to evaluate players' actions even if the shot results in no goal; this allows for effective differentiation and comparison between different shots and even enables counterfactual shot situation analysis. In our experiments, we have validated the framework by comparing it with baseline and ablated models. Furthermore, we have observed a high correlation between the xSOT and existing metrics. This alignment of information suggests that xSOT provides valuable insights. Lastly, as an illustration, we studied optimal strategies in the World Cup 2022 and analyzed a shot situation in EURO 2020.			arxiv	['Keisuke Fujii']	144.0
394	SciSports: Learning football kinematics through two-dimensional tracking data	Anatoliy Babic	2018-08-14 06:40:01	http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04550v1	SciSports is a Dutch startup company specializing in football analytics. This paper describes a joint research effort with SciSports, during the Study Group Mathematics with Industry 2018 at Eindhoven, the Netherlands. The main challenge that we addressed was to automatically process empirical football players' trajectories, in order to extract useful information from them. The data provided to us was two-dimensional positional data during entire matches. We developed methods based on Newtonian mechanics and the Kalman filter, Generative Adversarial Nets and Variational Autoencoders. In addition, we trained a discriminator network to recognize and discern different movement patterns of players. The Kalman-filter approach yields an interpretable model, in which a small number of player-dependent parameters can be fit; in theory this could be used to distinguish among players. The Generative-Adversarial-Nets approach appears promising in theory, and some initial tests showed an improvement with respect to the baseline, but the limits in time and computational power meant that we could not fully explore it. We also trained a Discriminator network to distinguish between two players based on their trajectories; after training, the network managed to distinguish between some pairs of players, but not between others. After training, the Variational Autoencoders generated trajectories that are difficult to distinguish, visually, from the data. These experiments provide an indication that deep generative models can learn the underlying structure and statistics of football players' trajectories. This can serve as a starting point for determining player qualities based on such trajectory data.			arxiv	['Harshit Bansal', 'Gianluca Finocchio', 'Julian Golak', 'Mark Peletier', 'Jim Portegies', 'Clara Stegehuis', 'Anuj Tyagi', 'Roland Vincze', 'William Weimin Yoo']	145.0

396	TacticAI: an AI assistant for football tactics	Zhe Wang	2023-10-16 16:25:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10553v2	Identifying key patterns of tactics implemented by rival teams, and developing effective responses, lies at the heart of modern football. However, doing so algorithmically remains an open research challenge. To address this unmet need, we propose TacticAI, an AI football tactics assistant developed and evaluated in close collaboration with domain experts from Liverpool FC. We focus on analysing corner kicks, as they offer coaches the most direct opportunities for interventions and improvements. TacticAI incorporates both a predictive and a generative component, allowing the coaches to effectively sample and explore alternative player setups for each corner kick routine and to select those with the highest predicted likelihood of success. We validate TacticAI on a number of relevant benchmark tasks: predicting receivers and shot attempts and recommending player position adjustments. The utility of TacticAI is validated by a qualitative study conducted with football domain experts at Liverpool FC. We show that TacticAI's model suggestions are not only indistinguishable from real tactics, but also favoured over existing tactics 90% of the time, and that TacticAI offers an effective corner kick retrieval system. TacticAI achieves these results despite the limited availability of gold-standard data, achieving data efficiency through geometric deep learning.			arxiv	['Petar Veličković', 'Daniel Hennes', 'Nenad Tomašev', 'Laurel Prince', 'Michael Kaisers', 'Yoram Bachrach', 'Romuald Elie', 'Li Kevin Wenliang', 'Federico Piccinini', 'William Spearman', 'Ian Graham', 'Jerome Connor', 'Yi Yang', 'Adrià Recasens', 'Mina Khan', 'Nathalie Beauguerlange', 'Pablo Sprechmann', 'Pol Moreno', 'Nicolas Heess', 'Michael Bowling', 'Demis Hassabis', 'Karl Tuyls']	147.0

The probability density functions (PDFs) of goals scored cannot be fitted over their entire ranges by Poisson or negative binomial distributions; here, we compare the PDFs with those arising from extremal statistics. In addition, we show that it is sufficient to model English top division and FA Cup matches in the seasons of 1970/71 to 2000/01 on Poisson or negative binomial distributions, as reported in analyses of earlier seasons, and that these are not consistent with extremal statistics.			arxiv	['P.

The action of the model is defined using a measure of integration built of degrees of freedom independent of the metric. There is no need to fine tune any bulk cosmological constant or the tension of the two (in the scenario described here) parallel branes to obtain zero cosmological constant, the only solutions are those with zero 4-D cosmological constant.

Carroll	2003-02-11 02:29:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0302067v1	We present an exact solution for a factorizable brane-world spacetime with two extra dimensions and explicit brane sources. The compactification manifold has the topology of a two-sphere, and is stabilized by a bulk cosmological constant and magnetic flux. The geometry of the sphere is locally round except for conical singularities at the locations of two antipodal branes, deforming the sphere into an American-style football. The bulk magnetic flux needs to be fine-tuned to obtain flat geometry on the branes. Once this is done, the brane geometry is insensitive to the brane vacuum energy, which only affects the conical deficit angle of the extra dimensions. Solutions of this form provide a new arena in which to explore brane-world phenomenology and the effects of extra dimensions on the cosmological constant problem.			arxiv	['Monica M. Guica']	150.0

They defy the very traditional meaning of the fixed point that a point on the fixed point in the phase space should remain there forever, for, a fixed point can evolve as well!

As a consequence, we obtain the football solution with 4D Minkowski space as a new supersymmetric background that preserves 4D N=1 SUSY. In the presence of brane multiplets, we derive the 4D effective supergravity action for the football background and show that the remaining modulus can be stabilized by a bulk non-perturbative correction with brane uplifting potentials at a zero vacuum energy. We find that the U(1)_R mediation can be a dominant source of SUSY breaking for a brane scalar with nonzero R charge.			arxiv	[]	152.0

We propose in this paper a non-parametric algorithm dedicated to segment and to detect objects in color images issued from a football sports meeting. Indeed segmentation by pixel concern many applications and revealed how the method is robust to detect objects, even in presence of strong shadows and highlights. In the other hand to refine their playing strategy such as in football, handball, volley ball, Rugby..., the coach need to have a maximum of technical-tactics information about the on-going of the game and the players. We propose in this paper a range of algorithms allowing the resolution of many problems appearing in the automated process of team identification, where each player is affected to his corresponding team relying on visual data. The developed system was tested on a match of the Tunisian national competition. This work is prominent for many next computer vision studies as it's detailed in this study.			arxiv	['Mourad Moussa Jlassi']	153.0

Using passing data made available by FIFA during the 2010 World Cup, we construct for each team a weighted and directed network in which nodes correspond to players and arrows to passes. The resulting network or graph provides a direct visual inspection of a team's strategy, from which we can identify play pattern, determine hot-spots on the play and localize potential weaknesses. Using different centrality measures, we can also determine the relative importance of each player in the game, the `popularity' of a player, and the effect of removing players from the game.			arxiv	['Hugo Touchette']	154.0

In a series of six variations on this theme, we prove corresponding results for principal bundles over the following schemes and stacks: (1) a line modulo the group of nth roots of unity; (2) a football, that is, an orbifold of genus zero with two marked points; (3) a gerbe over a football whose structure group is the nth roots of unity; (4) a chain of lines meeting in nodes; (5) a line modulo an action of a split torus; and (6) a chain modulo an action of a split torus.

We investigate the problem of producing an automated system to make the same evaluation of passes. We present a model that constructs numerical predictor variables from spatiotemporal match data using feature functions based on methods from computational geometry, and then learns a classification function from labelled examples of the predictor variables. Furthermore, the learned classifiers are analysed to determine if there is a relationship between the complexity of the algorithm that computed the predictor variable and the importance of the variable to the classifier. Experimental results show that we are able to produce a classifier with 85.8% accuracy on classifying passes as Good, OK or Bad, and that the predictor variables computed using complex methods from computational geometry are of moderate importance to the learned classifiers. Finally, we show that the inter-rater agreement on pass classification between the machine classifier and a human observer is of similar magnitude to the agreement between two observers.			arxiv	['Joachim Gudmundsson', 'Sanjay Chawla', 'Joël Estephan']	158.0

Here we use Japanese and German football data to investigate correlates between temporal patterns of formation changes across matches and match results. We found that individual teams and managers both showed win-stay lose-shift behavior, a type of reinforcement learning. In other words, they tended to stick to the current formation after a win and switch to a different formation after a loss. In addition, formation changes did not statistically improve the results of succeeding matches.The results indicate that a swift implementation of a new formation in the win-stay lose-shift manner may not be a successful managerial rule of thumb.			arxiv	['Naoki Masuda']	159.0

Through skill and chance, the script of each game is dynamically written in real time by players acting out possible trajectories allowed by a sport's rules. By properly characterizing a given sport's ecology of `game stories', we are able to capture the sport's capacity for unfolding interesting narratives, in part by contrasting them with random walks. Here, we explore the game story space afforded by a data set of 1,310 Australian Football League (AFL) score lines. We find that AFL games exhibit a continuous spectrum of stories rather than distinct clusters. We show how coarse-graining reveals identifiable motifs ranging from last minute comeback wins to one-sided blowouts. Through an extensive comparison with biased random walks, we show that real AFL games deliver a broader array of motifs than null models, and we provide consequent insights into the narrative appeal of real games.			arxiv	['A.

The Gaussian process perspective enables a) a principled way of dealing with uncertainty and b) rich models, specified through kernel functions. Using this connection, we tackle the problem of predicting outcomes of football matches between national teams. We develop a player kernel that relates any two football matches through the players lined up on the field. This makes it possible to share knowledge gained from observing matches between clubs (available in large quantities) and matches between national teams (available only in limited quantities). We evaluate our approach on the Euro 2008, 2012 and 2016 final tournaments.			arxiv	['Victor Kristof', 'Antonio J. González Ferrer', 'Matthias Grossglauser']	161.0

Especially, we find that there exists a characteristic interpersonal distance $ r\simeq 500 $ cm below which the circular variance for their alignment decreases rapidly. By introducing the order parameter $ \phi(t) $ in order to measure degree of alignment of players' velocity vectors, we also find that the angle distribution between the nearest players' velocity vectors becomes wrapped Cauchy ($ \phi \lesssim 0.7 $) and the mixture of von Mises and wrapped Cauchy distributions ($ \phi \gtrsim 0.7 $), respectively. To understand these findings, we construct a simple model for the motion of the two interacting players with the following rules: chasing between the players and the reset of the chasing. We numerically show that our model successfully reproduce the results obtained from the actual data. Moreover, from the numerical study, we find that there is another characteristic distance $ r\simeq 1000 $ cm below which player's chasing starts.			arxiv	['Yoshihiro Yamazaki']	162.0

We first describe the standard plus-minus methodology as used in basketball and ice-hockey and then adapt it for use in soccer. The usual goal-differential plus-minus is considered before two variations are proposed. For the first variation, we present a methodology to calculate an expected goals plus-minus rating. The second variation makes use of in-play probabilities of match outcome to evaluate an expected points plus-minus rating. We use the ratings to examine who are the best players in European football, and demonstrate how the players' ratings evolve over time. Finally, we shed light on the debate regarding which is the strongest league. The model suggests the English Premier League is the strongest, with the German Bundesliga a close runner-up.			arxiv	['Javier López Peña', 'Ian McHale']	163.0

As we will see, Network Science allows addressing different aspects of the team organization and performance not captured by classical analyses based on the performance of individual players. The reason behind relies on the complex nature of the game, which, paraphrasing the foundational paradigm of complexity sciences ""can not be analyzed by looking at its components (i.e., players) individually but, on the contrary, considering the system as a whole"" or, in the classical words of after-match interviews ""it's not just me, it's the team""."			arxiv	['J.

414	Fitting motion models to contextual player behavior	Bartholomew Spencer	2019-07-24 22:32:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10762v1	The objective of this study was to incorporate contextual information into the modelling of player movements. This was achieved by combining the distributions of forthcoming passing contests that players committed to and those they did not. The resultant array measures the probability a player would commit to forthcoming contests in their vicinity. Commitment-based motion models were fit on 46220 samples of player behavior in the Australian Football League. It was found that the shape of commitment-based models differed greatly to displacement-based models for Australian footballers. Player commitment arrays were used to measure the spatial occupancy and dominance of the attacking team. The spatial characteristics of pass receivers were extracted for 2934 passes. Positional trends in passing were identified. Furthermore, passes were clustered into three components using Gaussian mixture models. Passes in the AFL are most commonly to one-on-one contests or unmarked players. Furthermore, passes were rarely greater than 25 m.			arxiv	['Karl Jackson', 'Sam Robertson']	165.0
415	The UEFA Champions League seeding is not strategy-proof since the 2015/16 season	László Csató	2019-12-14 08:23:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06804v3	Fairness has several interpretations in sports, one of them being that the rules should guarantee incentive compatibility, namely, a team cannot be worse off due to better results in any feasible scenario. The current seeding regime of the most prestigious annual European club football tournament, the UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) Champions League, is shown to violate this requirement since the 2015/16 season. In particular, if the titleholder qualifies for the first pot by being a champion in a high-ranked league, its slot is given to a team from a lower-ranked association, which can harm a top club from the domestic championship of the titleholder. However, filling all vacancies through the national leagues excludes the presence of perverse incentives. UEFA is encouraged to introduce this policy from the 2021-24 cycle onwards.			arxiv	[]	166.0
416	Forecasting football matches by predicting match statistics	Edward Wheatcroft	2020-01-24 17:05:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09097v1	This paper considers the use of observed and predicted match statistics as inputs to forecasts of the outcomes of football matches. It is shown that, were it possible to know the match statistics in advance, highly informative forecasts of the match outcome could be made. Whilst, in practice, match statistics are never available prior to the match, this leads to a simple philosophy. If match statistics can be predicted pre-match, and if those predictions are accurate enough, it follows that informative match forecasts can be made. It is shown that Generalised Attacking Performance (GAP) ratings, introduced in a recent paper, provide a suitable methodology for predicting match statistics in advance and that they are informative enough to provide information beyond that reflected in the odds. A long term and robust gambling profit is demonstrated when the forecasts are combined with two betting strategies.			arxiv	[]	167.0
417	Home advantage of European major football leagues under COVID-19 pandemic	Eiji Konaka	2021-01-02 14:37:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00457v2	Since March 2020, the environment surrounding football has changed dramatically because of the COVID-19 pandemic. After a few months' break, re-scheduled matches were held behind closed doors without spectators. The main objective of this study is a quantitative evaluation of ``crowd effects'' on home advantage, using the results of these closed matches. The proposed analysis uses pairwise comparison method to reduce the effects caused by the unbalanced schedule. The following conclusions were drawn from the statistical hypothesis tests conducted in this study: In four major European leagues, the home advantage is reduced in closed matches compared to than in the normal situation, i.e., with spectators. The reduction amounts among leagues were different. For example, in Germany, the home advantage was negative during the closed-match period. On the other hand,in England,statistically significant differences in home advantage were not observed between closed matches and normal situation.			arxiv	[]	168.0
418	A Compact Codimension Two Braneworld with Precisely One Brane	Nikolas Akerblom	2010-04-11 13:40:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.1807v3	Building on earlier work on football shaped extra dimensions, we construct a compact codimension two braneworld with precisely one brane. The two extra dimensions topologically represent a 2-torus which is stabilized by a bulk cosmological constant and magnetic flux. The torus has positive constant curvature almost everywhere, except for a single conical singularity at the location of the brane. In contradistinction to the football shaped case, there is no fine-tuning required for the brane tension. We also present some plausibility arguments why the model should not suffer from serious stability issues.			arxiv	['Gunther Cornelissen']	169.0
419	A Bayesian inference approach for determining player abilities in football	Gavin A. Whitaker	2017-09-25 13:47:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00001v2	We consider the task of determining a football player's ability for a given event type, for example, scoring a goal. We propose an interpretable Bayesian model which is fit using variational inference methods. We implement a Poisson model to capture occurrences of event types, from which we infer player abilities. Our approach also allows the visualisation of differences between players, for a specific ability, through the marginal posterior variational densities. We then use these inferred player abilities to extend the Bayesian hierarchical model of Baio and Blangiardo (2010) which captures a team's scoring rate (the rate at which they score goals). We apply the resulting scheme to the English Premier League, capturing player abilities over the 2013/2014 season, before using output from the hierarchical model to predict whether over or under 2.5 goals will be scored in a given game in the 2014/2015 season. This validates our model as a way of providing insights into team formation and the individual success of sports teams.			arxiv	['Ricardo Silva', 'Daniel Edwards', 'Ioannis Kosmidis']	170.0
420	On Elo based prediction models for the FIFA Worldcup 2018	Lorenz A. Gilch	2018-06-05 20:36:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01930v1	We propose an approach for the analysis and prediction of a football championship. It is based on Poisson regression models that include the Elo points of the teams as covariates and incorporates differences of team-specific effects. These models for the prediction of the FIFA World Cup 2018 are fitted on all football games on neutral ground of the participating teams since 2010. Based on the model estimates for single matches Monte-Carlo simulations are used to estimate probabilities for reaching the different stages in the FIFA World Cup 2018 for all teams. We propose two score functions for ordinal random variables that serve together with the rank probability score for the validation of our models with the results of the FIFA World Cups 2010 and 2014. All models favor Germany as the new FIFA World Champion. All possible courses of the tournament and their probabilities are visualized using a single Sankey diagram.			arxiv	['Sebastian Müller']	171.0

422	Unsupervised Methods for Identifying Pass Coverage Among Defensive Backs with NFL Player Tracking Data	Rishav Dutta	2019-06-26 22:48:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11373v3	"Analysis of player tracking data for American football is in its infancy, since the National Football League (NFL) released its Next Gen Stats tracking data publicly for the first time in December 2018. While tracking datasets in other sports often contain detailed annotations of on-field events, annotations in the NFL's tracking data are limited. Methods for creating these annotations typically require extensive human labeling, which is difficult and expensive. We begin tackling this class of problems by creating annotations for pass coverage types by defensive backs using unsupervised learning techniques, which require no manual labeling or human oversight. We define a set of features from the NFL's tracking data that help distinguish between ""zone"" and ""man"" coverage. We use Gaussian mixture modeling and hierarchical clustering to create clusters corresponding to each group, and we assign the appropriate type of coverage to each cluster through qualitative analysis of the plays in each cluster. We find that the mixture model's ""soft"" cluster assignments allow for more flexibility when identifying coverage types. Our work makes possible several potential avenues of future NFL research, and we provide a basic exploration of these in this paper."			arxiv	['Ronald Yurko', 'Samuel Ventura']	173.0

By effectively utilizing modern accelerators, we show that it is not only possible to train on millions of frames per second but also to lower the cost of experiments compared to current methods. We achieve this with a simple architecture that features centralized inference and an optimized communication layer. SEED adopts two state of the art distributed algorithms, IMPALA/V-trace (policy gradients) and R2D2 (Q-learning), and is evaluated on Atari-57, DeepMind Lab and Google Research Football. We improve the state of the art on Football and are able to reach state of the art on Atari-57 three times faster in wall-time. For the scenarios we consider, a 40% to 80% cost reduction for running experiments is achieved. The implementation along with experiments is open-sourced so results can be reproduced and novel ideas tried out.			arxiv	['Raphaël Marinier', 'Piotr Stanczyk', 'Ke Wang', 'Marcin Michalski']	174.0
424	A regularized hidden Markov model for analyzing the 'hot shoe' in football	Marius Ötting	2019-11-19 08:02:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08138v1	Although academic research on the 'hot hand' effect (in particular, in sports, especially in basketball) has been going on for more than 30 years, it still remains a central question in different areas of research whether such an effect exists. In this contribution, we investigate the potential occurrence of a 'hot shoe' effect for the performance of penalty takers in football based on data from the German Bundesliga. For this purpose, we consider hidden Markov models (HMMs) to model the (latent) forms of players. To further account for individual heterogeneity of the penalty taker as well as the opponent's goalkeeper, player-specific abilities are incorporated in the model formulation together with a LASSO penalty. Our results suggest states which can be tied to different forms of players, thus providing evidence for the hot shoe effect, and shed some light on exceptionally well-performing goalkeepers, which are of potential interest to managers and sports fans.			arxiv	['Andreas Groll']	175.0
425	Investigating the efficiency of the Asian handicap football betting market with ratings and Bayesian networks	Anthony Constantinou	2020-03-10 09:50:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09384v2	Despite the massive popularity of the Asian Handicap (AH) football (soccer) betting market, its efficiency has not been adequately studied by the relevant literature. This paper combines rating systems with Bayesian networks and presents the first published model specifically developed for prediction and assessment of the efficiency of the AH betting market. The results are based on 13 English Premier League seasons and are compared to the traditional market, where the bets are for win, lose or draw. Different betting situations have been examined including a) both average and maximum (best available) market odds, b) all possible betting decision thresholds between predicted and published odds, c) optimisations for both return-on-investment and profit, and d) simple stake adjustments to investigate how the variance of returns changes when targeting equivalent profit in both traditional and AH markets. While the AH market is found to share the inefficiencies of the traditional market, the findings reveal both interesting differences as well as similarities between the two.			arxiv	[]	176.0
426	Predicting play calls in the National Football League using hidden Markov models	Marius Ötting	2020-03-24 11:48:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10791v1	In recent years, data-driven approaches have become a popular tool in a variety of sports to gain an advantage by, e.g., analysing potential strategies of opponents. Whereas the availability of play-by-play or player tracking data in sports such as basketball and baseball has led to an increase of sports analytics studies, equivalent datasets for the National Football League (NFL) were not freely available for a long time. In this contribution, we consider a comprehensive play-by-play NFL dataset provided by www.kaggle.com, comprising 289,191 observations in total, to predict play calls in the NFL using hidden Markov models. The resulting out-of-sample prediction accuracy for the 2018 NFL season is 71.5%, which is substantially higher compared to similar studies on play call predictions in the NFL.			arxiv	[]	177.0
427	Asymmetries in football: The pass-goal paradox	D. R. Antequera	2020-05-21 17:50:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10816v1	"We investigate the relation between the number of passes made by a football team and the number of goals. We analyze the 380 matches of a complete season of the Spanish national league ""LaLiga"" (2018/2019). We observe how the number of scored goals is positively correlated with the number of passes made by a team. In this way, teams on the top (bottom) of the ranking at the end of the season make more (less) passes than the rest of the teams. However, we observe a strong asymmetry when the analysis is made depending on the part of the match. Interestingly, fewer passes are made on the second part of a match while, at the same time, more goals are scored. This paradox appears in the majority of teams, and it is independent of the number of passes made. These results confirm that goals in the first part of matches are more ""costly"" in terms of passes than those scored on second halves."			arxiv	['D. Garrido', 'I. Echegoyen', 'R.

The problem is reduced to finding a trajectory of the ball from its current position to the opponents goals. Heuristic search algorithm, i.e. A*, is used to find such a trajectory. For this algorithm to be applicable we introduce a discretized model of the environment, i.e. a graph, as well as the core search components: cost function and heuristic function. Both are designed to take into account all the available information of the game state. We extensively evaluate the suggested approach in simulation comparing it to a range of baselines. The result of the conducted evaluation clearly shows the benefit of utilizing heuristic search within the RoboCup context.			arxiv	['Vladimir Litvinenko', 'Ilya Ryakin', 'Konstantin Yakovlev']	179.0
429	Wisdom of the crowds forecasting the 2018 FIFA Men's World Cup	Marco Henrique de Almeida Inácio	2020-08-29 16:23:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13005v1	The FIFA Men's World Cup Tournament (WCT) is the most important football (soccer) competition, attracting worldwide attention. A popular practice among football fans in Brazil is to organize contests in which each participant informs guesses on the final score of each match. The participants are then ranked according to some scoring rule. Inspired by these contests, we created a website to hold an online contest, in which participants were asked for their probabilities on the outcomes of upcoming matches of the WCT. After each round of the tournament, the ranking of all users based on a proper scoring rule were published. This paper studies the performance of some methods intended to extract the wisdom of the crowds, which are aggregated forecasts that uses some or all of the forecasts available. The later methods are compared to simpler forecasting strategies as well as to statistical prediction models. Our findings corroborate the hypothesis that, at least for sporting events, the wisdom of the crowds offers a competitive forecasting strategy. Specifically, some of these strategies were able to achieve high scores in our contest.			arxiv	['Rafael Izbicki', 'Danilo Lourenço Lopes', 'Luis Ernesto Salasar', 'João Poloniato', 'Marcio Alves Diniz']	180.0

Based on data provided by a major European carrier during mass events in a football stadium comprising up to 30.000 people, 16 base station sectors and $1$Km$^2$ area, we performed a data-driven analysis of the radio access network infrastructure dynamics during such events. Given the insights obtained from the analysis, we developed ARENA, a model-free deep learning Radio Access Network (RAN) capacity forecasting solution that, taking as input past network monitoring data and events context information, provides guidance to mobile operators on the expected RAN capacity needed during a future event. Our results, validated against real events contained in the dataset, illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution.			arxiv	['Vincenzo Sciancalepore', 'Andres Garcia-Saavedra', 'Xavier Costa-Perez', 'Georgios Agapiou', 'Hans D.

We highlight that the package is particularly useful as a data-driven tool for evaluating potential in-game strategies or rule changes within the league.

The use of a feedback mechanism to alert an athlete of a potential hit may mitigate the risk for sport-related concussion and catastrophic injury by allowing athletes to effectively brace for an otherwise unforeseen impact. In this project, we created a proximity sensor system using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to send haptic feedback to the wearer before a potential impact. Our pilot test consisted of three participants who wore our novel sensor system, who ran simulated routes to represent player-to-player contact. Additionally, we used simulated data from a Network Live Football (NFL) league game to further validate our contact prediction algorithm. Results show that our method can predict players' collisions with less than 14% false-alarms.			arxiv	['Fateme Nikseresht', 'Jacob Earl Resch', 'Laura Barnes', 'Mehdi Boukhechba']	184.0

We model the teams' objectives for a season and track how these evolve as games unfold to give a fluent objective that can aid in decision-making games. We develop Markov chain Monte Carlo and deep learning-based algorithms that make use of the fluent objectives in order to learn from prior games and other games in the environment and increase the teams' long-term performance. Simulations of our approach using real-world datasets from 760 matches shows that by using optimised tactics with our fluent objective and prior games, we can on average increase teams mean expected finishing distribution in the league by up to 35.6%.			arxiv	['Georgios Chalkiadakis', 'Timothy J.

435	Flexible marked spatio-temporal point processes with applications to event sequences from association football	Santhosh Narayanan	2021-03-08 10:15:29	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04647v3	We develop a new family of marked point processes by focusing the characteristic properties of marked Hawkes processes exclusively to the space of marks, providing the freedom to specify a different model for the occurrence times. This is possible through the decomposition of the joint distribution of marks and times that allows to separately specify the conditional distribution of marks given the filtration of the process and the current time. We develop a Bayesian framework for the inference and prediction from this family of marked point processes that can naturally accommodate process and point-specific covariate information to drive cross-excitations, offering wide flexibility and applicability in the modelling of real-world processes. The framework is used here for the modelling of in-game event sequences from association football, resulting not only in inferences about previously unquantified characteristics of game dynamics and extraction of event-specific team abilities, but also in predictions for the occurrence of events of interest, such as goals, corners or fouls in a specified interval of time.			arxiv	['Ioannis Kosmidis', 'Petros Dellaportas']	186.0
436	On the dependence in football match outcomes: traditional model assumptions and an alternative proposal	Marco Petretta	2021-03-12 13:47:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07272v2	The approaches routinely used to model the outcomes of football matches are characterised by strong assumptions about the dependence between the number of goals scored by the two competing teams and their marginal distribution. In this work, we argue that the assumptions traditionally made are not always based on solid arguments. Although most of these assumptions have been relaxed in the recent literature, the model introduced by Dixon and Coles in 1997 still represents a point of reference in the betting industry. While maintaining its conceptual simplicity, we propose a modification of the dependence structure. A real data application suggests that our model, named Mar-Co, outperforms the Dixon and Coles one in several betting scenarios, and parameter interpretation provides key insights on league dynamics.			arxiv	['Lorenzo Schiavon', 'Jacopo Diquigiovanni']	187.0
437	Does home advantage without crowd exist in American football?	Dávid Zoltán Szabó	2021-04-22 09:18:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11595v1	It is well-known that home team has an inherent advantage against visiting teams when playing team sports. One of the most obvious underlying reasons, the presence of supporting fans has mostly disappeared in major leagues with the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic. This paper investigates with the help of historical National Football League (NFL) data, how much effect spectators have on the game outcome. Our findings reveal that under no allowance of spectators the home teams' performance is substantially lower than under normal circumstances, even performing slightly worse than the visiting teams. On the other hand, when a limited amount of spectators are allowed to the game, the home teams' performance is no longer significantly different than what we observe with full stadiums. This suggests that from a psychological point of view the effect of crowd support is already induced by a fraction of regular fans.			arxiv	['Diego Andrés Pérez']	188.0

The proposed model allows predictions in terms of probabilities in order to quantify the chances for each team to reach a certain stage of the tournament. We use Monte Carlo simulations for estimating the outcome of each single match of the tournament, from which we are able to simulate the whole tournament itself. The model is fitted on all football games of the participating teams since 2014 weighted by date and importance.			arxiv	[]	189.0
439	More on verification of probability forecasts for football outcomes: score decompositions, reliability, and discrimination analyses	Jean-Louis Foulley	2021-06-28 00:21:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14345v1	Forecast of football outcomes in terms of Home Win, Draw and Away Win relies largely on ex ante probability elicitation of these events and ex post verification of them via computation of probability scoring rules (Brier, Ranked Probability, Logarithmic, Zero-One scores). Usually, appraisal of the quality of forecasting procedures is restricted to reporting mean score values. The purpose of this article is to propose additional tools of verification, such as score decompositions into several components of special interest. Graphical and numerical diagnoses of reliability and discrimination and kindred statistical methods are presented using different techniques of binning (fixed thresholds, quantiles, logistic and iso regression). These procedures are illustrated on probability forecasts for the outcomes of the UEFA Champions League (C1) at the end of the group stage based on typical Poisson regression models with reasonably good results in terms of reliability as compared to those obtained from bookmaker odds and whatever the technique used. Links with research in machine learning and different areas of application (meteorology, medicine) are discussed.			arxiv	[]	190.0

Our adaptation considers the advantage of playing at home when considering the potential of the home and away teams. The algorithm predicts the tournament's outcome by using the market value or/and the ongoing team's performance as initial conditions in the context of Monte Carlo simulations. We present and compare our results to the worldwide known SPI predictions performed by the ""FiveThirtyEight"" project. The results show that the algorithm can deliver good predictions even with a few ingredients and in more complicated seasons like the 2020 editions where the matches were played without fans in the stadiums."			arxiv	['Roberto da Silva', 'Henrique A.

These quantitative facts can empower new applications like automated infographic generation. We formulate part and whole extraction as a sequence tagging problem. Due to the large gap between part/whole and its corresponding percentage, we introduce skip mechanism in sequence modeling, and achieved improved performance on both our task and the CoNLL-2003 named entity recognition task. Experimental results demonstrate that learning to skip in sequence tagging is promising."			arxiv	['Jian-Guang Lou']	192.0

Corner kick taken events are often decisive in the match outcome and inherently arrive in batch with serial clustering pattern. Providing parameter estimates with intuitive interpretation, a class of compound Poisson regression including a Bayesian implementation of geometric-Poisson distribution is introduced. With a varying shape parameter, the corner counts serial correlation between matches is handled naturally within the Bayesian model. In this study, information elicited from cross-market betting odds was used to improve the model predictability.

443	FIFA ranking: Evaluation and path forward	Leszek Szczecinski	2021-12-20 21:08:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00691v1	"In this work we study the ranking algorithm used by F\'ed\'eration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA); we analyze the parameters it currently uses, show the formal probabilistic model from which it can be derived, and optimize the latter. In particular, analyzing the games since the introduction of the algorithm in 2018, we conclude that the game's ""importance"" (as defined by FIFA) used in the algorithm is counterproductive from the point of view of the predictive capability of the algorithm. We also postulate the algorithm to be rooted in the formal modelling principle, where the Davidson model proposed in 1970 seems to be an excellent candidate, preserving the form of the algorithm currently used. The results indicate that the predictive capability of the algorithm is notably improved by using the home-field advantage and the explicit model for the draws in the game. Moderate, but notable improvement may be attained by introducing the weighting of the results with the goal differential, which although not rooted in a formal modelling principle, is compatible with the current algorithm and can be tuned to the characteristics of the football competition."			arxiv	['Iris-Ioana Roatis']	194.0
444	Distances for Comparing Multisets and Sequences	George Bolt	2022-06-17 15:59:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08858v1	Measuring the distance between data points is fundamental to many statistical techniques, such as dimension reduction or clustering algorithms. However, improvements in data collection technologies has led to a growing versatility of structured data for which standard distance measures are inapplicable. In this paper, we consider the problem of measuring the distance between sequences and multisets of points lying within a metric space, motivated by the analysis of an in-play football data set. Drawing on the wider literature, including that of time series analysis and optimal transport, we discuss various distances which are available in such an instance. For each distance, we state and prove theoretical properties, proposing possible extensions where they fail. Finally, via an example analysis of the in-play football data, we illustrate the usefulness of these distances in practice.			arxiv	['Simón Lunagómez', 'Christopher Nemeth']	195.0
445	Prediction of Football Player Value using Bayesian Ensemble Approach	Hansoo Lee	2022-06-24 07:13:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13246v1	The transfer fees of sports players have become astronomical. This is because bringing players of great future value to the club is essential for their survival. We present a case study on the key factors affecting the world's top soccer players' transfer fees based on the FIFA data analysis. To predict each player's market value, we propose an improved LightGBM model by optimizing its hyperparameter using a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm. We identify prominent features by the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm. The proposed method has been compared against the baseline regression models (e.g., linear regression, lasso, elastic net, kernel ridge regression) and gradient boosting model without hyperparameter optimization. The optimized LightGBM model showed an excellent accuracy of approximately 3.8, 1.4, and 1.8 times on average compared to the regression baseline models, GBDT, and LightGBM model in terms of RMSE. Our model offers interpretability in deciding what attributes football clubs should consider in recruiting players in the future.			arxiv	['Bayu Adhi Tama', 'Meeyoung Cha']	196.0
446	Complexity emerges in measures of the marking dynamics in football games	A. Chacoma	2022-07-20 15:51:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09992v2	In this article, we study the dynamics of marking in football matches. To do this, we surveyed and analyzed a database containing the trajectories of players from both teams on the field of play during three professional games. We describe the dynamics through the construction of temporal bipartite networks of proximity. Based on the introduced concept of proximity, the nodes are the players, and the links are defined between opponents that are close enough to each other at a given moment. By studying the evolution of the heterogeneity parameter of the networks during the game, we characterized a scaling law for the average shape of the fluctuations, unveiling the emergence of complexity in the system. Moreover, we proposed a simple model to simulate the players' motion in the field from where we obtained the evolution of a synthetic proximity network. We show that the model captures with a remarkable agreement the complexity of the empirical case, hence it proves to be helpful to elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed phenomena.			arxiv	['M.

447	Predicting Football Match Outcomes with eXplainable Machine Learning and the Kelly Index	Yiming Ren	2022-11-28 19:32:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15734v1	In this work, a machine learning approach is developed for predicting the outcomes of football matches. The novelty of this research lies in the utilisation of the Kelly Index to first classify matches into categories where each one denotes the different levels of predictive difficulty. Classification models using a wide suite of algorithms were developed for each category of matches in order to determine the efficacy of the approach. In conjunction to this, a set of previously unexplored features were engineering including Elo-based variables. The dataset originated from the Premier League match data covering the 2019-2021 seasons. The findings indicate that the process of decomposing the predictive problem into sub-tasks was effective and produced competitive results with prior works, while the ensemble-based methods were the most effective. The paper also devised an investment strategy in order to evaluate its effectiveness by benchmarking against bookmaker odds. An approach was developed that minimises risk by combining the Kelly Index with the predefined confidence thresholds of the predictive models. The experiments found that the proposed strategy can return a profit when following a conservative approach that focuses primarily on easy-to-predict matches where the predictive models display a high confidence level.			arxiv	['Teo Susnjak']	198.0
448	Event Detection in Football using Graph Convolutional Networks	Aditya Sangram Singh Rana	2023-01-24 14:52:54	http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10052v1	The massive growth of data collection in sports has opened numerous avenues for professional teams and media houses to gain insights from this data. The data collected includes per frame player and ball trajectories, and event annotations such as passes, fouls, cards, goals, etc. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have recently been employed to process this highly unstructured tracking data which can be otherwise difficult to model because of lack of clarity on how to order players in a sequence and how to handle missing objects of interest. In this thesis, we focus on the goal of automatic event detection from football videos. We show how to model the players and the ball in each frame of the video sequence as a graph, and present the results for graph convolutional layers and pooling methods that can be used to model the temporal context present around each action.			arxiv	[]	199.0
449	A Continuous-Time Stochastic Process for High-Resolution Network Data in Sports	Nicholas Grieshop	2023-03-02 14:49:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01318v1	Technological advances have paved the way for collecting high-resolution tracking data in basketball, football, and other team-based sports. Such data consist of interactions among players of competing teams indexed by space and time. High-resolution tracking data on interactions among players are vital to understanding and predicting the performance of teams, because the performance of a team is more than the sum of the strengths of its individual players. We introduce a continuous-time stochastic process as a model of interactions among players of competing teams indexed by space and time, discuss properties of the continuous-time stochastic process, and learn the stochastic process from high-resolution tracking data by pursuing a Bayesian approach. We present an application to Juventus Turin, Inter Milan, and other Italian football clubs.			arxiv	['Yong Feng', 'Guanyu Hu', 'Michael Schweinberger']	200.0
450	Diversity is Strength: Mastering Football Full Game with Interactive Reinforcement Learning of Multiple AIs	Chenglu Sun	2023-06-28 03:56:57	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15903v1	Training AI with strong and rich strategies in multi-agent environments remains an important research topic in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The AI's strength is closely related to its diversity of strategies, and this relationship can guide us to train AI with both strong and rich strategies. To prove this point, we propose Diversity is Strength (DIS), a novel DRL training framework that can simultaneously train multiple kinds of AIs. These AIs are linked through an interconnected history model pool structure, which enhances their capabilities and strategy diversities. We also design a model evaluation and screening scheme to select the best models to enrich the model pool and obtain the final AI. The proposed training method provides diverse, generalizable, and strong AI strategies without using human data. We tested our method in an AI competition based on Google Research Football (GRF) and won the 5v5 and 11v11 tracks. The method enables a GRF AI to have a high level on both 5v5 and 11v11 tracks for the first time, which are under complex multi-agent environments. The behavior analysis shows that the trained AI has rich strategies, and the ablation experiments proved that the designed modules benefit the training process.			arxiv	['Shuo Shen', 'Sijia Xu', 'Weidong Zhang']	201.0
451	Visitors Out! The Absence of Away Team Supporters as a Source of Home Advantage in Football	Federico Fioravanti	2023-08-03 13:22:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06279v2	We seek to gain more insight into the effect of the crowds on the Home Advantage by analyzing the particular case of Argentinean football (also known as soccer), where for more than ten years, the visiting team fans were not allowed to attend the games. Additionally, during the COVID-19 lockdown, a significant number of games were played without both away and home team fans. The analysis of more than 20 years of matches of the Argentinean tournament indicates that the absence of the away team crowds was beneficial for the Top 5 teams during the first two years after their attendance was forbidden. An additional intriguing finding is that the lack of both crowds affects significantly all the teams, to the point of turning the home advantage into home `disadvantage' for most of the teams.			arxiv	['Fernando Delbianco', 'Fernando Tohmé']	202.0
452	Passing Heatmap Prediction Based on Transformer Model and Tracking Data	Yisheng Pei	2023-09-04 11:14:22	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01526v1	Although the data-driven analysis of football players' performance has been developed for years, most research only focuses on the on-ball event including shots and passes, while the off-ball movement remains a little-explored area in this domain. Players' contributions to the whole match are evaluated unfairly, those who have more chances to score goals earn more credit than others, while the indirect and unnoticeable impact that comes from continuous movement has been ignored. This research presents a novel deep-learning network architecture which is capable to predict the potential end location of passes and how players' movement before the pass affects the final outcome. Once analysed more than 28,000 pass events, a robust prediction can be achieved with more than 0.7 Top-1 accuracy. And based on the prediction, a better understanding of the pitch control and pass option could be reached to measure players' off-ball movement contribution to defensive performance. Moreover, this model could provide football analysts a better tool and metric to understand how players' movement over time contributes to the game strategy and final victory.			arxiv	['Varuna De Silva', 'Mike Caine']	203.0
453	Analytics, have some humility: a statistical view of fourth-down decision making	Ryan S. Brill	2023-11-06 20:00:16	http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03490v3	The standard mathematical approach to fourth-down decision making in American football is to make the decision that maximizes estimated win probability. Win probability estimates arise from machine learning models fit from historical data. These models, however, are overfit high-variance estimators, exacerbated by the highly correlated nature of football play-by-play data. We develop a machine learning framework that accounts for this auto-correlation and knits uncertainty quantification into our decision making. In particular, we recommend a fourth-down decision when we are confident it has higher win probability than all other decisions. Our final product is a major advance in fourth-down strategic decision making: far fewer fourth-down decisions are as obvious as analysts claim.			arxiv	['Ronald Yurko', 'Abraham J. Wyner']	204.0

The code of the methods and metrics are provided so that they can be used as a benchmark in future comparisons. The recent YOLO8n model proves better than FootAndBall in long-shot real-time detection of the ball and players on football fields.			arxiv	['Ilias Maglogiannis']	205.0
455	From Motor Control to Team Play in Simulated Humanoid Football	Siqi Liu	2021-05-25 20:17:10	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12196v1	Intelligent behaviour in the physical world exhibits structure at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Although movements are ultimately executed at the level of instantaneous muscle tensions or joint torques, they must be selected to serve goals defined on much longer timescales, and in terms of relations that extend far beyond the body itself, ultimately involving coordination with other agents. Recent research in artificial intelligence has shown the promise of learning-based approaches to the respective problems of complex movement, longer-term planning and multi-agent coordination. However, there is limited research aimed at their integration. We study this problem by training teams of physically simulated humanoid avatars to play football in a realistic virtual environment. We develop a method that combines imitation learning, single- and multi-agent reinforcement learning and population-based training, and makes use of transferable representations of behaviour for decision making at different levels of abstraction. In a sequence of stages, players first learn to control a fully articulated body to perform realistic, human-like movements such as running and turning; they then acquire mid-level football skills such as dribbling and shooting; finally, they develop awareness of others and play as a team, bridging the gap between low-level motor control at a timescale of milliseconds, and coordinated goal-directed behaviour as a team at the timescale of tens of seconds. We investigate the emergence of behaviours at different levels of abstraction, as well as the representations that underlie these behaviours using several analysis techniques, including statistics from real-world sports analytics. Our work constitutes a complete demonstration of integrated decision-making at multiple scales in a physically embodied multi-agent setting.

Here we show that if a phase transition occurs on a flat brane, so as to change its tension, then the brane will not remain flat. In other words, there is really no self-tuning in such models, which can in fact be understood in four-dimensional terms and are therefore subject to Weinberg's no-go theorem.			arxiv	['Massimo Porrati']	209.0

As a result, we present who were the best players and how their performance evolved, define volatility metrics to measure a player's consistency, and build a player development curve to assist decision-making.			arxiv	['Luís Meireles', 'João Mendes-Moreira']	227.0

We prove that any compact Riemann surface with a CSC-1 reducible conformal metric of finite conical singularities can be divided into a finite number of pieces by cutting along geodesics where each piece is isometric to some football. This allows us to study the existence of CSC-1 reducible conformal metrics with finite conical singularities on a compact Riemann surface. As an application, we give an angle condition of the existence of CSC-1 reducible conformal metrics with finite conical singularities on a compact Riemann surface.			arxiv	['Yingyi Wu', 'Bin Xu']	228.0

With 32 countries and over 800 players representing nearly 300 clubs globally, it measured up to more than 12 billion EUR in the players' current estimated market value total. In this short piece, we explore what the small and interconnected world of football stars looks like and even make a few efforts and compare success in soccer to social networks.			arxiv	['Patrik Szigeti']	229.0

Depending on the game plan & philosophy; some teams prefer to play long balls from either wings or defense. Others, prefer to penetrate in depth with passes and outplay the opponent players. To objectively & in an automated way evaluate how teams play penetrative passes compared to the number of times they had the potential to do so, the ""Potential Penetrative Pass (P3)"" concept is presented here."			arxiv	[]	230.0

With ongoing discussions about attaining a model with such functionality, we present supporting evidence regarding the feasibility of such models. We evaluated our models on multiple datasets, including Twitter Sentiment, Football Commentary, Project Gutenberg, PubMedQA, and SQuAD, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced detection approaches. These datasets were sampled with intricate constraints encompassing every possibility, laying the foundation for future research. We evaluate GPT-3.5-Turbo against various detectors such as SVM, RoBERTa-base, and RoBERTa-large. Based on the research findings, the results predominantly relied on the sequence length of the sentence.			arxiv	['Ashish Bhagchandani', 'Harsh Oza']	231.0

This Named Entity (NE) can be a named: location, person, organization, date, time, etc., characterized by instances. A NE is found in texts accompanied by contexts: words that are left or right of the NE. The work mainly aims at identifying contexts inducing the NE's nature. As such, The occurrence of the word ""President"" in a text, means that this word or context may be followed by the name of a president as President ""Obama"". Likewise, a word preceded by the string ""footballer"" induces that this is the name of a footballer. NE recognition may be viewed as a classification method, where every word is assigned to a NE class, regarding the context. The aim of this study is then to identify and classify the contexts that are most relevant to recognize a NE, those which are frequently found with the NE. A learning approach using training corpus: web documents, constructed from learning examples is then suggested. Frequency representations and modified tf-idf representations are used to calculate the context weights associated to context frequency, learning example frequency, and document frequency in the corpus."			arxiv	[]	232.0
482	Anticipating Activity in Social Media Spikes	Desmond J. Higham	2014-06-08 19:33:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2017v1	We propose a novel mathematical model for the activity of microbloggers during an external, event-driven spike. The model leads to a testable prediction of who would become most active if a spike were to take place. This type of information is of great interest to commercial organisations, governments and charities, as it identifies key players who can be targeted with information in real time when the network is most receptive. The model takes account of the fact that dynamic interactions evolve over an underlying, static network that records who listens to whom. The model is based on the assumption that, in the case where the entire community has become aware of an external news event, a key driver of activity is the motivation to participate by responding to incoming messages. We test the model on a large scale Twitter conversation concerning the appointment of a UK Premier League football club manager. We also present further results for a Bundesliga football match, a marketing event and a television programme. In each case we find that exploiting the underlying connectivity structure improves the prediction of who will be active during a spike. We also show how the half-life of a spike in activity can be quantified in terms of the network size and the typical response rate.			arxiv	['Peter Grindrod', 'Alexander V.

Eric Eager	2015-06-09 21:09:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03104v1	On Monday January 19, 2015 a story broke that the National Football League (NFL) had started an investigation into whether the New England Patriots deliberately deflated the footballs they used during their championship win over the Indianapolis Colts. Like an infectious disease, discussion regarding Deflategate grew rapidly on social media sites in the hours and days after the release of the story. However, after the Super Bowl was over, the scandal slowly began to dissipate and lost much of the attention it had originally had, as interest in the NFL wained at the completion of its season. We construct a simple epidemic model for the infectiousness of the Deflategate news story. We then use data from the social media site Twitter to estimate the parameters of this model using standard techniques from the study of inverse problems. We find that the infectiousness (as measured by the basic reproduction number) of Deflategate rivals that of any infectious disease that we are aware of, and is actually more infectious than recent news stories of greater importance - both in terms of the basic reproduction number and in terms of the average amount of time the average tweeter continued to tweet about the news story.			arxiv	['Megan Eberle', 'James Peirce']	234.0
484	The football {5, 6, 6} and its geometries: from a sport tool to fullerens and further	Emil Molnár	2017-03-07 08:10:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02264v1	This presentation starts with the regular polygons, of course, then with the Platonic and Archimedean solids. The latter ones are whose symmetry groups are transitive on the vertices, and in addition, whose faces are regular polygons (see only I. Prok's home page [11] for them). Then there come these symmetry groups themselves (starting with the cube and octahedron, of course, then icosahedron and dodecahedron). Then come the space filling properties: Namely the cube is a space filler for the Euclidean space E^3. Then we jump for the other regular solids that cannot fil E^3, but can hyperbolic space H^3, a new space. These can be understood better if we start regular polygons, of course, that cannot fil E^2 in general, but can fil the new plane H2, as hyperbolic or Bolyai-Lobachevsky plane. Now it raises the problem, whether a football polyhedron - with its congruent copies - fil a space. It turns out that E^3 is excluded (it remains an open problem - for you, of course, in other aspects), but H^3 can be filled as a schematic construction show this (Fig. 5), far from elementary. Then we mention some stories on Buckminster Fuller, an architect, who imagined first time fullerens as such crystal structures. Many problems remain open, of course, we are just in the middle of living science.			arxiv	['István Prok', 'Jenő Szirmai']	235.0
485	A Probabilistic Model for Predicting Shot Success in Football	Edward Wheatcroft	2021-01-06 15:51:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02104v1	Football forecasting models traditionally rate teams on past match results, that is based on the number of goals scored. Goals, however, involve a high element of chance and thus past results often do not reflect the performances of the teams. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that accounting for other match events such as shots at goal can provide a better indication of the relative strengths of two teams than the number of goals scored. Forecast models based on this information have been shown to be successful in outperforming those based purely on match results. A notable weakness, however, is that this approach does not take into account differences in the probability of shot success among teams. A team that is more likely to score from a shot will need fewer shots to win a match, on average. In this paper, we propose a simple parametric model to predict the probability of a team scoring, given it has taken a shot at goal. We show that the resulting forecasts are able to outperform a model assuming an equal probability of shot success among all teams. We then show that the model can be combined with predictions of the number of shots achieved by each team, and can increase the skill of forecasts of both the match outcome and of whether the total number of goals in a match will exceed 2.5. We assess the performance of the forecasts alongside two betting strategies and find mixed evidence for improved performance.			arxiv	['Ewelina Sienkiewicz']	236.0
486	The Probabilistic Final Standing Calculator: a fair stochastic tool to handle abruptly stopped football seasons	Hans Van Eetvelde	2021-01-26 07:14:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10597v1	The COVID-19 pandemic has left its marks in the sports world, forcing the full-stop of all sports-related activities in the first half of 2020. Football leagues were suddenly stopped and each country was hesitating between a relaunch of the competition and a premature ending. Some opted for the latter option, and took as the final standing of the season the ranking from the moment the competition got interrupted. This decision has been perceived as unfair, especially by those teams who had remaining matches against easier opponents. In this paper, we introduce a tool to calculate in a fairer way the final standings of domestic leagues that have to stop prematurely: our Probabilistic Final Standing Calculator (PFSC). It is based on a stochastic model taking into account the results of the matches played and simulating the remaining matches, yielding the probabilities for the various possible final rankings. We have compared our PFSC with state-of-the-art prediction models, using previous seasons which we pretend to stop at different points in time. We illustrate our PFSC by showing how a probabilistic ranking of the French Ligue 1 in the stopped 2019-2020 season could have led to alternative, potentially fairer, decisions on the final standing.			arxiv	['Lars Magnus Hvattum', 'Christophe Ley']	237.0
487	Beating the bookies with their own numbers - and how the online sports betting market is rigged	Lisandro Kaunitz	2017-10-08 11:44:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02824v2	The online sports gambling industry employs teams of data analysts to build forecast models that turn the odds at sports games in their favour. While several betting strategies have been proposed to beat bookmakers, from expert prediction models and arbitrage strategies to odds bias exploitation, their returns have been inconsistent and it remains to be shown that a betting strategy can outperform the online sports betting market. We designed a strategy to beat football bookmakers with their own numbers. Instead of building a forecasting model to compete with bookmakers predictions, we exploited the probability information implicit in the odds publicly available in the marketplace to find bets with mispriced odds. Our strategy proved profitable in a 10-year historical simulation using closing odds, a 6-month historical simulation using minute to minute odds, and a 5-month period during which we staked real money with the bookmakers (we made code, data and models publicly available). Our results demonstrate that the football betting market is inefficient - bookmakers can be consistently beaten across thousands of games in both simulated environments and real-life betting. We provide a detailed description of our betting experience to illustrate how the sports gambling industry compensates these market inefficiencies with discriminatory practices against successful clients.			arxiv	['Shenjun Zhong', 'Javier Kreiner']	238.0

In the case of a football field, the area to cover is large, thus several regular cameras should be used, which makes the setup expensive and complex. As an alternative, we developed a system that detects players from a unique cheap and wide-angle fisheye camera assisted by a single narrow-angle thermal camera. In this work, we train a network in a knowledge distillation approach in which the student and the teacher have different modalities and a different view of the same scene. In particular, we design a custom data augmentation combined with a motion detection algorithm to handle the training in the region of the fisheye camera not covered by the thermal one. We show that our solution is effective in detecting players on the whole field filmed by the fisheye camera. We evaluate it quantitatively and qualitatively in the case of an online distillation, where the student detects players in real time while being continuously adapted to the latest video conditions.			arxiv	['Adrien Deliège', 'Noor Ul Huda', 'Rikke Gade', 'Marc Van Droogenbroeck', 'Thomas B.

489	Home Advantage in the Brazilian Elite Football: Verifying managers' capacity to outperform their disadvantage	Carlos Denner dos Santos	2020-07-23 21:07:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12255v1	Home advantage (HA) in football, soccer is well documented in the literature; however, the explanation for such phenomenon is yet to be completed, as this paper demonstrates that it is possible to overcome such disadvantage through managerial planning and intervention (tactics), an effect so far absent in the literature. To accomplish that, this study develops an integrative theoretical model of team performance to explain HA based on prior literature, pushing its limits to unfold the manager role in such a persistent pattern of performance in soccer. Data on one decade of the national tournament of Brazil was obtained from public sources, including information about matches and coaches of all 12 teams who played these competitions. Our conceptual modeling allows an empirical analysis of HA and performance that covers the effects of tactics, presence of supporters in matches and team fatigue via logistic regression. The results confirm the HA in the elite division of Brazilian soccer across all levels of comparative technical quality, a new variable introduced to control for a potential technical gap between teams (something that would turn the managerial influence null). Further analysis provides evidence that highlights managerial capacity to block the HA effect above and beyond the influences of fatigue (distance traveled) and density of people in the matches. This is the case of coaches Abel Braga, Marcelo Fernandes and Roger Machado, who were capable to reverse HA when playing against teams of similar quality. Overall, the home advantage diminishes as the comparative quality increases but disappears only when the two teams are of extremely different technical quality.			arxiv	['Jessica Alves']	240.0
490	Improving state estimation through projection post-processing for activity recognition with application to football	Michał Ciszewski	2021-02-05 17:32:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03310v4	The past decade has seen an increased interest in human activity recognition based on sensor data. Most often, the sensor data come unannotated, creating the need for fast labelling methods. For assessing the quality of the labelling, an appropriate performance measure has to be chosen. Our main contribution is a novel post-processing method for activity recognition. It improves the accuracy of the classification methods by correcting for unrealistic short activities in the estimate. We also propose a new performance measure, the Locally Time-Shifted Measure (LTS measure), which addresses uncertainty in the times of state changes. The effectiveness of the post-processing method is evaluated, using the novel LTS measure, on the basis of a simulated dataset and a real application on sensor data from football. The simulation study is also used to discuss the choice of the parameters of the post-processing method and the LTS measure.			arxiv	['Jakob Söhl', 'Geurt Jongbloed']	241.0
491	Time Window of Head Impact Kinematics Measurement for Calculation of Brain Strain and Strain Rate in American Football	Yuzhe Liu	2021-02-10 20:33:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05728v1	Wearable devices have been shown to effectively measure the head movement during impacts in sports like American football. When a head impact occurs, the device is triggered to collect and save the kinematic measurements during a predefined time window. Then, based on the collected kinematics, finite element (FE) head models can calculate brain strain, which is used to evaluate the risk of mild traumatic brain injury. To find a time window that can provide a sufficient duration of kinematics for FE analysis, we investigated 118 on-field video-confirmed head impacts collected by the Stanford Instrumented Mouthguard. Because the individual differences in brain geometry influence these calculations, we included six representative brain geometries and found that larger brains need a longer time window of kinematics for accurate calculation. Among the different sizes of brains, a pre-trigger time of 20 ms and a post-trigger time of 70 ms were found to yield calculations of brain strain and strain rate that were not significantly different from calculations using the original 200 ms time window recorded by the mouthguard.			arxiv	['August G.

Indeed, without shaped rewards, i.e., with only terminal rewards, present-day Embodied AI results degrade significantly across Embodied AI problems from single-agent Habitat-based PointGoal Navigation (SPL drops from 55 to 0) and two-agent AI2-THOR-based Furniture Moving (success drops from 58% to 1%) to three-agent Google Football-based 3 vs. 1 with Keeper (game score drops from 0.6 to 0.1). As training from shaped rewards doesn't scale to more realistic tasks, the community needs to improve the success of training with terminal rewards. For this we propose GridToPix: 1) train agents with terminal rewards in gridworlds that generically mirror Embodied AI environments, i.e., they are independent of the task; 2) distill the learned policy into agents that reside in complex visual worlds. Despite learning from only terminal rewards with identical models and RL algorithms, GridToPix significantly improves results across tasks: from PointGoal Navigation (SPL improves from 0 to 64) and Furniture Moving (success improves from 1% to 25%) to football gameplay (game score improves from 0.1 to 0.6). GridToPix even helps to improve the results of shaped reward training.			arxiv	['Iou-Jen Liu', 'Svetlana Lazebnik', 'Aniruddha Kembhavi', 'Luca Weihs', 'Alexander Schwing']	243.0

Namely an ability estimate for every team based on historic matches; an ability estimate for every team based on bookmaker consensus; average plus-minus player ratings based on their individual performances in their home clubs and national teams; and further team covariates (e.g., market value, team structure) and country-specific socio-economic factors (population, GDP). The proposed combined approach is used for learning the number of goals scored in the matches from the four previous UEFA EUROs 2004-2016 and then applied to current information to forecast the upcoming UEFA EURO 2020. Based on the resulting estimates, the tournament is simulated repeatedly and winning probabilities are obtained for all teams. A random forest model favors the current World Champion France with a winning probability of 14.8% before England (13.5%) and Spain (12.3%). Additionally, we provide survival probabilities for all teams and at all tournament stages.			arxiv	['Lars Magnus Hvattum', 'Christophe Ley', 'Franziska Popp', 'Gunther Schauberger', 'Hans Van Eetvelde', 'Achim Zeileis']	244.0
494	Kinematics clustering enables head impact subtyping for better traumatic brain injury prediction	Xianghao Zhan	2021-08-07 18:31:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03498v1	Traumatic brain injury can be caused by various types of head impacts. However, due to different kinematic characteristics, many brain injury risk estimation models are not generalizable across the variety of impacts that humans may sustain. The current definitions of head impact subtypes are based on impact sources (e.g., football, traffic accident), which may not reflect the intrinsic kinematic similarities of impacts across the impact sources. To investigate the potential new definitions of impact subtypes based on kinematics, 3,161 head impacts from various sources including simulation, college football, mixed martial arts, and car racing were collected. We applied the K-means clustering to cluster the impacts on 16 standardized temporal features from head rotation kinematics. Then, we developed subtype-specific ridge regression models for cumulative strain damage (using the threshold of 15%), which significantly improved the estimation accuracy compared with the baseline method which mixed impacts from different sources and developed one model (R^2 from 0.7 to 0.9). To investigate the effect of kinematic features, we presented the top three critical features (maximum resultant angular acceleration, maximum angular acceleration along the z-axis, maximum linear acceleration along the y-axis) based on regression accuracy and used logistic regression to find the critical points for each feature that partitioned the subtypes. This study enables researchers to define head impact subtypes in a data-driven manner, which leads to more generalizable brain injury risk estimation.			arxiv	['Yiheng Li', 'Yuzhe Liu', 'Nicholas J.

Distance metrics can only serve as proxy for similarity in information retrieval of similar instances. Learning a good similarity function from human annotations improves the quality of retrievals. This work uses deep metric learning to learn these user-defined similarity functions from few annotations for a large football trajectory dataset. We adapt an entropy-based active learning method with recent work from triplet mining to collect easy-to-answer but still informative annotations from human participants and use them to train a deep convolutional network that generalizes to unseen samples. Our user study shows that our approach improves the quality of the information retrieval compared to a previous deep metric learning approach that relies on a Siamese network. Specifically, we shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of passive sampling heuristics and active learners alike by analyzing the participants' response efficacy. To this end, we collect accuracy, algorithmic time complexity, the participants' fatigue and time-to-response, qualitative self-assessment and statements, as well as the effects of mixed-expertise annotators and their consistency on model performance and transfer-learning.			arxiv	['Kion Fallah', 'Stefano Fenu', 'Dario Zanca', 'Bjoern Eskofier', 'Christopher John Rozell', 'Christopher Mutschler']	246.0
496	Crediting football players for creating dangerous actions in an unbiased way: the generation of threat (GoT) indices	Ali Baouan	2023-04-11 14:27:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05242v1	We introduce an innovative methodology to identify football players at the origin of threatening actions in a team. In our framework, a threat is defined as entering the opposing team's danger area. We investigate the timing of threat events and ball touches of players, and capture their correlation using Hawkes processes. Our model-based approach allows us to evaluate a player's ability to create danger both directly and through interactions with teammates. We define a new index, called Generation of Threat (GoT), that measures in an unbiased way the contribution of a player to threat generation. For illustration, we present a detailed analysis of Chelsea's 2016-2017 season, with a standout performance from Eden Hazard. We are able to credit each player for his involvement in danger creation and determine the main circuits leading to threat. In the same spirit, we investigate the danger generation process of Stade Rennais in the 2021-2022 season. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive ranking of Ligue 1 players based on their generated threat in the 2021-2022 season. Our analysis reveals surprising results, with players such as Jason Berthomier, Moses Simon and Frederic Guilbert among the top performers in the GoT rankings. We also present a ranking of Ligue 1 central defenders in terms of generation of threat and confirm the great performance of some center-back pairs, such as Nayef Aguerd and Warmed Omari.			arxiv	['Sébastien Coustou', 'Mathieu Lacome', 'Sergio Pulido', 'Mathieu Rosenbaum']	247.0

To guarantee that the opponents of the clubs are of the same strength in the new design, it is crucial to forecast the performance of the teams before the tournament as well as possible. This paper investigates whether the currently used rating of the teams, the UEFA club coefficient, can be improved by taking the games played in the national leagues into account. According to our logistic regression models, a variant of the Elo method provides a higher accuracy in terms of explanatory power in the Champions League matches. The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) is encouraged to follow the example of the FIFA World Ranking and reform the calculation of the club coefficients in order to avoid unbalanced schedules in the novel tournament format of the Champions League.			arxiv	[]	248.0
498	Toward more accurate and generalizable brain deformation estimators for traumatic brain injury detection with unsupervised domain adaptation	Xianghao Zhan	2023-06-08 14:52:56	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05255v1	Machine learning head models (MLHMs) are developed to estimate brain deformation for early detection of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the overfitting to simulated impacts and the lack of generalizability caused by distributional shift of different head impact datasets hinders the broad clinical applications of current MLHMs. We propose brain deformation estimators that integrates unsupervised domain adaptation with a deep neural network to predict whole-brain maximum principal strain (MPS) and MPS rate (MPSR). With 12,780 simulated head impacts, we performed unsupervised domain adaptation on on-field head impacts from 302 college football (CF) impacts and 457 mixed martial arts (MMA) impacts using domain regularized component analysis (DRCA) and cycle-GAN-based methods. The new model improved the MPS/MPSR estimation accuracy, with the DRCA method significantly outperforming other domain adaptation methods in prediction accuracy (p<0.001): MPS RMSE: 0.027 (CF) and 0.037 (MMA); MPSR RMSE: 7.159 (CF) and 13.022 (MMA). On another two hold-out test sets with 195 college football impacts and 260 boxing impacts, the DRCA model significantly outperformed the baseline model without domain adaptation in MPS and MPSR estimation accuracy (p<0.001). The DRCA domain adaptation reduces the MPS/MPSR estimation error to be well below TBI thresholds, enabling accurate brain deformation estimation to detect TBI in future clinical applications.			arxiv	['Jiawei Sun', 'Yuzhe Liu', 'Nicholas J.

499	The Cheltsov--Rubinstein problem for strongly asymptotically log del Pezzo surfaces	Chenzi Jin	2023-06-12 17:58:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07278v1	"The notion of (strongly) asymptotically log Fano varieties was introduced in 2013 by Cheltsov--Rubinstein, who posed the problem of classifying all strongly asymptotically log del Pezzo surfaces with smooth boundary that admit K\""ahler--Einstein edge metrics. Thanks to the Cheltsov--Rubinstein classification, this amounts to considering 10 families. In 8 families the problem has been solved by work of Cheltsov--Rubinstein, Fujita and Mazzeo--Rubinstein. The remaining 2 families are rational surfaces parameterized by the self-intersection of the 0-section $n$ and the number of blow-ups $m$. By Cheltsov--Rubinstein, Cheltsov--Rubinstein--Zhang and Fujita, K\""ahler--Einstein edge metrics exist when either $m=0$ or $m\geq3$ for the first family, and the cases $m=1,2$ have been studied by Fujita--Liu--S\""uss--Zhang--Zhuang and Fujita. The final remaining family, denoted $\mathrm{(II.6A.n.m)}$ in the Cheltsov--Rubinstein classification, is more difficult as the boundary consists of two components, unlike any of the other 9 families. It is the generalization of the football to complex surfaces with the pair $\mathrm{(II.6A.0.0)}$ being exactly the football times $\mathbb{P}^1$. The pairs $\mathrm{(II.6A.n.0)}$ have been completely understood by the work of Rubinstein--Zhang using the $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundle structure of Hirzebruch surfaces. This article studies the family $\mathrm{(II.6A.n.m)}$ for $m\geq1$. These pairs no longer have a $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundle structure and are therefore more difficult to tackle. The main result is a necessary and sufficient condition on the angles for the existence of K\""ahler--Einstein edge metrics, generalizing the Rubinstein--Zhang condition. Thus, we resolve the Cheltsov--Rubinstein problem for strongly asymptotically log del Pezzo surfaces."			arxiv	[]	250.0
