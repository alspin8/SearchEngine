To address this issue and enhance the overall experience for all football enthusiasts, we are implementing a new approach. Starting Today: Weekly Discussion Thread: We are introducing a dedicated Weekly Discussion Thread where you can freely share banter, simple questions, statements, and other low-effort content. Some examples of low effort posts that will no longer be allowed to be their own thread and should be in the weekly thread. Best ______ (game, goal, position, starting lineup) etc. What is your opinion on _____________? Messi/Ronaldo posts Who is better x or y posts. Who will win the league, champions league, finish top 4, be relegated etc... posts. Who is underrated/overrated posts. What team should I cheer for? How do I illegally stream games for free? Posts about equipment should be in /r/bootroom. Outside of the Weekly Thread: Posts outside of the weekly thread should be substantial efforts, such as in-depth analyses or extensive discussions that can't be accommodated in the weekly thread. We kindly urge our community to collaborate with us on this initiative. Together, we can transform r/football into a premier destination for high-quality football discussions. Thank you for your support in making r/football the best place for football fans worldwide! Best regards, The r/football Mod Team	<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11f7c4940>	reddit

2	What do you think is the ceiling for someone like Jude Bellingham considering what he is doing for Real Madrid at 20 years old with 15 goals (+ 4 assists) in only 16 games on his very first season?	:Soccer_ball:	2023-11-30 08:35:42	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/187dvhp/what_do_you_think_is_the_ceiling_for_someone_like/	Jude Bellingham has taken Real Madrid and World Football by a storm right now! He's gathered 15 goals + 4 assists in just 16 games for Real Madrid breaking the records of Puskas, Di Stefano and Ronaldo himself. All of this while just recently turning 20 years old, with his entire career ahead of him. What he's doing is unheard of, perhaps only Ronaldo Fenomenon himself had a better start to the season than him as a 20 years old. The differentiator however is his impact in the game, he's truly bossing the free role at Madrid contrubuting in goals, assists, key passes, dribbles, crosses, headers, flicks, finishing, playmaking, 1-2 passing, off ball movements, interceptions, tackles, positioning, strength, dominating, work rate and even leadership.. There is truly nothing that this boy can't do! I genuinely cannot point a single weakness in his game right now, he's top of the charts for almost all attributes since the start of the season. So these achievements so far in the season brings the question, **What is his ceiling as a footballer provided he continues this streak? Generational? All-Timer? GOAT candidate?**	<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11f7cb220>	reddit

5	Once a Taliban stronghold, now enjoy their football in peace, scenes from Wana, Pakistan	:Soccer_ball:	2023-11-30 15:14:14	https://x.com/footballpak/status/769456377274171392	> Once a Taliban stronghold, now they enjoy their football in peace, scenes from Wana, South Waziristan, FATA > Action from match between Afghan FC Chaman and Aatish FC Tank played at Wana Sports Stadium. Football dominates here > Football clearly dominates tribal life despite very little infrastructure, FATA doesn't even have a full voting seat in PFF Congress. I appreciate that this is six years old, but I just wanted to bring it back to light since football is trending a lot more in Pakistan now.	0	reddit	
6	Where to find shirts for very niche global teams?	:Soccer_ball:	2023-11-30 15:16:19	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/187kwbv/where_to_find_shirts_for_very_niche_global_teams/	Hey, as the title says, and apologies if this is the wrong sub, I read the rules and it seems to apply but if not feel free to point me. My friend is massively into football, notably small obscure teams from around the world, and is obsessed with football manager. I try to listen to his currently in to because I want to get him a gift for Christmas. Some of the teams he's in to at the moment are: [Diagoras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.A.E._G.S._Diagoras) [Aveley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aveley_F.C.) [Budapest Honved](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Honv%C3%A9d_FC) [Piacenza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piacenza_Calcio_1919) I'm at my wits end, I've gone to dozens of sites a piece, looked at classic shirt sites, eBay, official stores and I can't seem to find anything. I most notably want to find the Greek team Diagoras as I know he's playing that on FBM23 at the moment. Any advice or links would be greatly appreciated, I know nothing about football, all I know and like is what he knows and likes. (Go Lazio?)	<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x138307af0>	reddit

9	Do you think any club can overtake Real Madrid's overhaul of record Champions League titles in our lifetimes or will they retain that record? (50-60 years)	:Soccer_ball:	2023-11-29 10:29:23	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/186mddm/do_you_think_any_club_can_overtake_real_madrids/	Real Madrid currently have won 14 CL titles, do you think in the next 50-60 years, any club could have overtaken them in the record or they'd continue to reign? Their team is currently in transition, but with assembly of young stars like Vini, Rodrygo, Bellingham, Endrick, Camavinga, Tchouameni, Valverde, Militao, Guler and potentially Davies + Mbappe in 2024 may get them more CL wins in this decade alone! Do you think any team can overtake them in most CLs won by our lifetime or is the gap too big to overcome?	<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x13830c430>	reddit	
10	Predicting football tables by a maximally parsimonious model	Kjetil Haugen	2018-05-23 02:25:04	http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08937v1	This paper presents some useful mathematical results involved in football table prediction. In addition, some empirical results indicate that an alternative methodology for football table prediction may produce high quality forecasts with far less resource usage than conventional methods.		arxiv	['Brynjulf Owren']
11	Network analysis of the worldwide footballer transfer market	Ming-Xia Li	2018-11-01 10:16:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00300v1	The transfer of football players is an important part in football games. Most studies on the transfer of football players focus on the transfer system and transfer fees but not on the transfer behavior itself. Based on the 470,792 transfer records from 1990 to 2016 among 23,605 football clubs in 206 countries and regions, we construct a directed footballer transfer network (FTN), where the nodes are the football clubs and the links correspond to the footballer transfers. A systemic analysis is conduced on the topological properties of the FTN. We find that the in-degrees, out-degrees, in-strengths and out-strengths of nodes follow bimodal distributions (a power law with exponential decay), while the distribution of link weights has a power-law tail. We further figure out the correlations between node degrees, node strengths and link weights. We also investigate the general characteristics of different measures of network centrality. Our network analysis of the global footballer transfer market sheds new lights into the investigation of the characteristics of transfer activities.		arxiv	['Wei-Xing Zhou', 'H. Eugene Stanley']
12	Networks of international football: communities, evolution and globalization of the game	Yang Li	2022-05-21 13:43:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10599v1	As the most popular sport around the globe, the game of football has recently intrigued much research interest to explore and distill useful and appealing information from the sport. Network science and graph-centric methods have been previously applied to study the importance of football players and teams. In this paper, for the first time we study the macroscopic evolution of the football society from a complex network point of view. Football game records within a time window of over a century were collected and expressed in a graph format, where participant teams are represented by graph nodes and the games between them are the graph edges. We carry out community detection and temporal analysis to reveal the dynamic features and the community structures embedded within the football network, offering the evidence of a continuously expanding football society. Spatio-temporal analysis is also implemented to unveil the temporal states that represent distinct development stages in the football history. Our analysis suggests that the evolution of the game receives considerable impact not only from major sport events, but also from multiple social and political incidents. The game of football and its evolution reflect significant historical transitions and turning points, and can provide a novel perspective for the study of the worldwide globalization process.		arxiv	['Gonzalo Mateos']
13	The classification of football patterns	V. Braungart	2006-06-08 16:14:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606193v1	We prove that every spherical football (also known as a spherical soccer ball) is a branched cover, branched only in the vertices, of the standard football made up of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. We also give examples showing that the corresponding result is not true for footballs of higher genera. Moreover, we classify the possible pairs (k,l) for which football patterns on the sphere exist satisfying a natural generalisation of the usual incidence relation between pentagons and hexagons to k-gons and l-gons.		arxiv	['D.

In this review, we summarize the efforts that we have made to fulfil this dream until recently. In addition, an introductory version of FerSML (Footballer and Football Simulation Markup Language) is presented in this paper.		arxiv	[]
15	Small angle limits of Hamilton's footballs	Yanir A. Rubinstein	2019-05-02 17:27:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00865v1	Compact Ricci solitons on surfaces have at most two cone points, and are known as Hamilton's footballs. In this note we completely describe the degenerations of these footballs as one or both of the cone angles approaches zero. In particular, we show that Hamilton's famous non-compact cigar soliton is the Gromov--Hausdorff limit of Hamilton's compact conical teardrop solitons.		arxiv	['Kewei Zhang']
16	Seasonal Linear Predictivity in National Football Championships	Giuseppe Jurman	2015-11-19 17:14:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06262v1	Predicting the results of sport matches and competitions is an arising research field, benefiting from the growing amount of available data and the novel data analytics techniques. Excellent forecasts can be achieved by advanced machine learning methods applied to detailed historical data, especially in very popular sports such as football (soccer). Here we show that, despite the large number of confounding factors, the results of a football team in longer competitions (e.g., a national league) follow a basically linear trend useful for predictive purposes, too. In support of this claim, we present a set of experiments of linear regression on a database collecting the yearly results of 707 teams playing in 22 divisions from 11 countries, in 20 football seasons.		arxiv	[]
17	Pricing Football Players using Neural Networks	Sourya Dey	2017-11-16 00:14:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05865v2	We designed a multilayer perceptron neural network to predict the price of a football (soccer) player using data on more than 15,000 players from the football simulation video game FIFA 2017. The network was optimized by experimenting with different activation functions, number of neurons and layers, learning rate and its decay, Nesterov momentum based stochastic gradient descent, L2 regularization, and early stopping. Simultaneous exploration of various aspects of neural network training is performed and their trade-offs are investigated. Our final model achieves a top-5 accuracy of 87.2% among 119 pricing categories, and places any footballer within 6.32% of his actual price on average.		arxiv	[]
18	Predictive modelling of football injuries	Stylianos Kampakis	2016-09-20 11:58:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07480v1	The goal of this thesis is to investigate the potential of predictive modelling for football injuries. This work was conducted in close collaboration with Tottenham Hotspurs FC (THFC), the PGA European tour and the participation of Wolverhampton Wanderers (WW). Three investigations were conducted: 1. Predicting the recovery time of football injuries using the UEFA injury recordings: The UEFA recordings is a common standard for recording injuries in professional football. For this investigation, three datasets of UEFA injury recordings were available. Different machine learning algorithms were used in order to build a predictive model. The performance of the machine learning models is then improved by using feature selection conducted through correlation-based subset feature selection and random forests. 2. Predicting injuries in professional football using exposure records: The relationship between exposure (in training hours and match hours) in professional football athletes and injury incidence was studied. A common problem in football is understanding how the training schedule of an athlete can affect the chance of him getting injured. The task was to predict the number of days a player can train before he gets injured. 3. Predicting intrinsic injury incidence using in-training GPS measurements: A significant percentage of football injuries can be attributed to overtraining and fatigue. GPS data collected during training sessions might provide indicators of fatigue, or might be used to detect very intense training sessions which can lead to overtraining. This research used GPS data gathered during training sessions of the first team of THFC, in order to predict whether an injury would take place during a week.		arxiv	[]
19	Explaining the difference between men's and women's football	Luca Pappalardo	2021-01-05 17:25:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01662v1	Women's football is gaining supporters and practitioners worldwide, raising questions about what the differences are with men's football. While the two sports are often compared based on the players' physical attributes, we analyze the spatio-temporal events during matches in the last World Cups to compare male and female teams based on their technical performance. We train an artificial intelligence model to recognize if a team is male or female based on variables that describe a match's playing intensity, accuracy, and performance quality. Our model accurately distinguishes between men's and women's football, revealing crucial technical differences, which we investigate through the extraction of explanations from the classifier's decisions. The differences between men's and women's football are rooted in play accuracy, the recovery time of ball possession, and the players' performance quality. Our methodology may help journalists and fans understand what makes women's football a distinct sport and coaches design tactics tailored to female teams.		arxiv	['Alessio Rossi', 'Giuseppe Pontillo', 'Michela Natilli', 'Paolo Cintia']
