2	Need help with finding my position	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-09 14:52:27	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/192ggeu/need_help_with_finding_my_position/	Hi guys! Could you help me find my positions based on my strengths and weaknesses? Any help will be appreciated. I usually play as center-back (decently strong ok at height at 176 cm or 5'9), but I'm kinda getting tired of it. So, in my opinion, my strengths are: Quite fast (when dribbling I usually kick the ball on and chase after it), high stamina, used to be a crazy slide tackler (trying to quit that), can dribble (on a good day) and when given space I usually do very well, creating lots of chances and getting shots on target, can body people, decently powerful shot from range (let's not talk about accuracy) and sometimes I can make a few good runs Oh god here comes, weaknesses: COMPOSURE and decision making (have this inability to retain possession when pressed, and with the usually small school pitches, I am constantly under a lot of pressure, causing me to make many crucial mistakes), quite a few fouls, passing, usually dribbling, finishing under pressure (again the first 2) So I'm thinking to train myself to become better at shooting and dribbling to become a striker (there is a lot of competition in defence and don't think I'll ever be competent enough in midfield). Any suggestions on which position I should play or how to improve my weaknesses?	9.0	t3_192ggeu	reddit

It's been ""rumoured' that he doesn't actually coach the players. Only does the man management etc etc Similar with Gerrard with Beale as his coach. To me it seems crazy because how the hell do you know if some dudes a snake oil salesman without knowing whats BS and whats not by excelling at the role yourself? Am not saying he can't ever only focus on man management but at some point you gotta be able to deal with coaching side if needs be.

5	Question about offside rule and the 2022 WC Final	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-09 03:55:53	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1925dap/question_about_offside_rule_and_the_2022_wc_final/	Was looking at a video of Kolo Muani's last minute shot which Dibu miraculously saved in the 2022 World Cup Final and there's another French player (Mbappe I think) to the left of him who is in an offside position the moment that the pass (which is quite long) is made. Muani himself is clearly onside but I'm curious if he had scored it would have been disallowed because of the other player, given that had the ball been kicked just slightly to the left he would have been the recipient. Is an offside called only when a player receives it? Or can it be called the moment the passing player kicks? In which case there would have been no way of knowing which of the two players would have received it. Here's a good video of the play in slow mo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muPvADrwSYo&ab\_channel=LAMPUALADINIDX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muPvADrwSYo&ab_channel=LAMPUALADINIDX)	3.0	t3_1925dap	reddit

8	Football revolutionary’s, who has made the biggest impact on the way we play football in your lifetime?	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-08 23:01:19	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/191ywf9/football_revolutionarys_who_has_made_the_biggest/	With the passing of Daz Kaiser today can you think of any other players who influenced the game so much that it much as BeckenBuaer’s style of defending. In my lifetime I have seen many changes in the way teams line up but in my opinion nobody has had such an impact on the modern game as Claude Makalele, he made defensive midfielders as a must have in any good team from the 2000s. Never gave the ball away, didn’t try anything flash and barely crossed the halfway line, giving the more creative midfielders space and time to pick a pass, mopped up any loose balls or mistakes by teammates and allowing the full backs to bomb forwards knowing they were covered. He did all this and made it look easy. In the words of the famous zidane when asked about Real Madrids decision to sell him to Chelsea in order to accommodate David Beckham “ why put another layer of gold paint on the Bentley, when you are losing the entire engine” Does anybody have other examples of players who have totally changed the way we think about the modern game ?	4.0	t3_191ywf9	reddit		
9	Neymar didn’t make a mistake leaving Barcelona, his mistake was going to PSG	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-07 23:02:13	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1915g41/neymar_didnt_make_a_mistake_leaving_barcelona_his/	Contrary to popular opinion, I don’t believe Neymar made a mistake leaving Barcelona where I believe he did need to leave if he ever wanted a chance to win the Ballon D’or as unselfish as Messi is Neymar would never win a Ballon D’or in Barcelona as Messi would always be the main guy even if you think he was going to take a backseat. Messi is so good that he can still be the best player with necessarily contributing to goals at much and combine that with the fact that Messi is everything to Barcelona and although Neymar is loved very much in Barcelona it’s not even close to what Messi means to Barcelona so in that sense I think he had to leave. His mistake in my opinion was going to PSG because in the grand scheme of things it just don’t workout. He goes to Paris and pairs up with Mbappe in Ligue 1 which is already highly disrespected as a lower league and although I don’t think this is the main factor as they’ve been to a final and semi final in UCL I do think it’s a factor nonetheless. I think it worked out in the beginning since most people tend to neglect this but I believe his beginning years in PSG were PEAK Neymar as all the stats back up the claim that he was at his peak his first few seasons in Paris. It started off well but then injuries became a recurring theme and Mbappe started to get better and better and dice he was French, automatically became the star and main guy of the club. Then ultimately later on one of his greatest friends Messi came along which overshadowed even more, which was one of the whole points of him leaving in the first place.(that and money) I think Neymar had golden opportunities to win Ballon D’or in PSG especially if he brought Paris their first UCL especially in 2021 (cancelled Ballon D’or in 2020) but ultimately came up short mostly due to injuries imo.( and also Neymar was severely mistreated but those terrible PSG fans while in Paris, and Messi and Ronaldo never really declined at the time for Neymar to have a fair shot at the Ballon D’or) I think it was a good idea for him to leave Barcelona in terms of individual success but terrible to go to PSG. What do you guys think? Should he have stayed? I here could he have gone besides PSG?	56.0	t3_1915g41	reddit		
10	2008-2012 Barcelona Diamond Midfield (Busquets, Xavi, Iniesta, Messi)	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-08 18:04:31	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/191rhh4/20082012_barcelona_diamond_midfield_busquets_xavi/	Were those 4 players above really the only players that mattered in that 2008-2012 pep team? I mean... you could rotate any other player outside those 4 players with other players and pep's Barcelona would still be the Goat team. No way any other team in history could out dominate that midfield diamond in their prime. All 4 of these players goat psychopathic levels of composure and calmness. I'm just picturing being a striker, winger, left back, right back, goalie, and CB's having this as my midfield: Messi Xavi Iniesta Busquets It just seems like a joke playing with this... you could pass the ball to any of these 4 players in tight situations and they'd retain possession easily. making your life way easier as a teammate.	3.0	t3_191rhh4	reddit

12	What is with people “gatekeeping” footballers?	Unknown	2024-01-09 01:08:55	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1921u7t/what_is_with_people_gatekeeping_footballers/	Posting about this amidst the recent Beckenbauer news (rest in peace). With a lot of friends my age (19) talking about him as a footballer, there are many who are being critical and saying we can’t comment on (or even appreciate) players like him because we weren’t alive to watch them. This discussion has also come up with the likes of Maradona within the goat debate, with people saying we (young people) can’t include him in the debate “because you never watched him”. To this degree I feel like older football fans are “gate keeping” the footballers they grew up with, which I think is against the spirit of the game. As a football fan, regardless of age, I believe it is my right to be a fan of all football history that is accessible to me, especially in today’s day and age with platforms like YouTube on our hands.

16	Top 10 Caribbean Leagues (In my Opinion)	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-08 21:06:56	https://i.redd.it/synrb6y27abc1.jpeg	"1.🇹🇹 Trinidad and Tobago: This one, was kinda tricky, it""s hard to decide between them and haiti, because both of them have a relatevely good league and both won x2 the ""Concachampions"". But i decided on Trinidad, because of the International Stage. Trinidad has 7 more Caribbean Championships and also 9 more Sub-championships than Haitian Clubs. The only way Haiti beats Trinidad, is in having more high ranked clubs in the concacaf club rankings, and that's it. 2. 🇭🇹 Haiti: The 2nd best league behind Trinidad, they have 2 Concachampions, 2 Caribbean championships, and the gran majority of teams in the concacaf club rankings. 3. 🇯🇲Jamaica: If it wasnt for their lack of Concachampionship (they dont have a single one), they would be 2nd place. Because in the international caribbean competitions, Jamaica clearly surpass Haiti. Having won 4 Caribbean championships, and having 4 2nd places (sub-championships). They also are the league with more teams on the concacaf club rankings after haiti, and the league with more high-ranking teams in the FDB. So yeah, that lack of continental champions is the only thing keeping them from being 2nd or 1st. 4. 🇸🇷 Surinam Their league dont appear neither in the concacaf ranking nor in the FDB. But they are still better than RD. And that's because of their 2 best teams. SV Transvaal and Robinhood. Who have done a lot in the international stage. They have won 2 concacaf champions cup, 2 caribbean shields, the first edition of the caribbean cup and they also have a lot of 2nd places. Surpassing RD by a lot. 5. 🇩🇴Republica Dominicana Even though they lack international trophies, they still won 2 Caribbean championships, one 2nd place, a Caribbean cup 3rd place and also, the bigger amount of teams in the concacaf rankings after haiti and jamaica. And also, they have a professional league. Sth that only them, jamaica, haiti and trinidad have. Almost of all the caribbean leagues are amateur So yeah. RD 5th place 6. 🇲🇶 Martinica They have won 2 Caribbean shields, and have at least one team on the concacaf ranking. It's not more than Puerto Rico, but the difference comes in the league. Martinica had a lot more consistent league than them. Having played it since 19xx, while puerto rico's began in 2015. In summary, they have more history. 7. 🇵🇷 P. Rico This is the last big league of the caribe. Having won 2 Caribbean championships and 1 Caribbean Shield Cup. They have more international prowess than martinica, but the lack of a decent league really hurts them. Their biggest team has only won 4 puerto rican leagues....yeah.... 8. 🇨🇼 Curazao They're here thanks to their domestic league. Being the most consistent one, having almost played every year. And even tho they dont have international cups, they had 3rds places here and there. Being the thing that separate thems from the majority of the caribbean leagues 9. 🇬🇵 Guadeloupe The same case as curazao, 1 caribbean championship 3rd and a better league in terms of teams and international aparitions. 10. 🇧🇧 Barbados The reason why i put them, and not antigua and barbuda. Is because even tho antigua had like 10 international aparitions, they have never reached the semifinals And barbados with only 3, made it. Also because i think barbados teams in general are better at the game than antigua teams. But, antigua could easily be Top 10 also, this is just my interpretation.

32	Question for my fellow Germans: How import is to you (an to your country) the 7-1 against Brasil?	:APL:Argentina	2024-01-06 21:20:25	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/190ai1z/question_for_my_fellow_germans_how_import_is_to/	I know that for Brazilians it's a big deal, like, the 7-1 has became a whole thing by its own and in terms of football there has been many changes in how people see the National Team after that (at least that’s what I can get from r/futebol, if any Brazilian wants to give a better insight on this, you're more than welcome). But now I want to know what meant and means to the Germans. I think that winning 7-1 in a WC semifinal to Brazil in their country will be almost the very best thing for my nation (only second to the fact itself of ***winning the World Cup***), but I'm biased because I'm Argentinian and we have a special beef as *bromance/frenemies* with them. So, what it means to you? As an example, would you preferred to have won that semifinal by a common margin (like 2-1) but then having not-awful performances in the following WCs (like advancing up until QF or SF instad of getting knocked out in GS)?	10.0	t3_190ai1z	reddit

34	Why do you support big European clubs and not clubs from your country or local ones?	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-07 07:45:10	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/190mzt6/why_do_you_support_big_european_clubs_and_not/	This question is for all the fans of big European clubs which live relatively far away from their favurite club. What football means to you? Is it watching on tv the best of the best play the game and cheering for one of these mega clubs? Or is it going to stadiums, cheering with other people around you together on the stands, sharing emotions, positive and negative, with all those fans around you united by one thing - love for your club. Going with your friends to away games and cheering even louder for your club so eventhough you are greatly outnumbered , you are heard throughout the stadium, pushing your team forward. Is it the stoppage time winner and complete ecstasy of you and everyone around you, kissing and hugging complete strangers, yet strangers united by this one loce and passion for your club, no matter how shitty they play compared to Barca, Real..... For me that's the real point of football, and I think so much of you guys are missing out on it, supporting a big and rich megaclub thousands of kilometers away, while your local team probably can't fill the stadium, and people like you are disconnected from a club which is a part of your community, your identity. Remember thatylu watching on tv Mbappe signing for your Real and scoring in final of cl to beat Barca cannot even compare to a feeling of joy and ecstasy when your club scores a winner in the last seconds against your bitter rivals and everyone goes nuts, be it in first or fourth division. Nothing can match that feeling. No one is saying that you can't still symphatize Barca, Real, Milan, Liverpool,.... but the amount of passion and love which can only be given to one club should be the one which is the part of your community, your collective identity. Club which you will support on the stadium whenever you can. I know this post is just wishfull thinking and that most of you will continue supporting these mega clubs, but if only 1 person I was able to convince to start attending football matches and stop the mindless support of big corporative clubs (which are the cancer of modern football, dominating and bullying all the other clubs and making modern football extremely boring and corrupt - all the money shared by 15/20 big clubs and no club outside can challenge them) I will regard it as a victory.	20.0	t3_190mzt6	reddit

36	Is there any way for smaller clubs to ever have a chance to truly compete in world football?	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-06 14:44:47	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1901gwb/is_there_any_way_for_smaller_clubs_to_ever_have_a/	I’ll use top 5 for example, we all know the top leagues are dominated as the following: Premier League- Big 6 La Liga- 2 teams and once in a while 3 teams Serie A- Big 6 like Prem Bundesliga- 1 team Ligue 1- 1 team That’s why I think it’d be good for clubs like Girona, Aston Villa, and Bayer Leverkusen to win there leagues as it changes the usual and predictable norm of the same teams winning their league. This could as set a precedent for football as a whole to become more competitive in the future. FFP has been absolutely AWFUL and I think a salary cap wouldn’t work as that would hinder smaller clubs due due the cap in spending. Would a luxury tax work? You break FFP or if you have a salary cap and go over the cap you pay back the league and the league redistributes the money to the rest of the clubs in the league. What do you guys think will smaller clubs ever consistently compete with bigger clubs in their leagues, in the UCL, and in world football as a whole?	19.0	t3_1901gwb	reddit

40	Why do English football fans like to diss Scottish football so much?	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-07 10:30:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/190pcib/why_do_english_football_fans_like_to_diss/	I saw the video of an English journalist asking Ange Postecoglou if he could 'visualise winning trophies' (as if none of his previous trophies counted) and then read the comments, which were filled with people dissing Scottish football, so I wondered why a lot of English football fans feel the need to do this. Obviously everyone is entitled to their opinion, but us Scottish fans know the standard isn't as good as the English Premier League, but we don't care, so what do you get out of telling us so? It's like a kid born into a rich family who goes to Eton slagging off a kid who goes to public school for not getting the same standard of education. Do you not realise how elitist it sounds? The thing is though, apart from Liverpool and Man Utd, most of your clubs would struggle to even finish 3rd in Scotland (if you had the same budgets as us, of course). Here's a few facts about our 'famers' league': - Scotland has the highest attendances in Europe per capita. - Ibrox holds the record for the largest league attendance in Britain. - Ibrox and Celtic Park were voted 1st and 2nd out of 100 by Four Four Two magazine for the best stadiums in Britain. - Hampden holds the record for the largest international attendance in Britain. - The highest UEFA club attendance ever was at Hampden. - In the last 4 seasons Scottish clubs have beaten: Porto, Galatasaray, Dortmund, Feyenoord, Lazio, Leipzig, PSV, Betis, AZ Alkmaar, Red Star, Braga, Rennes, Frankfurt, and Rosenborg (a list that most English teams would be proud of). I'm not slagging English football, I'm sure most Scots support the British clubs in Europe, but the next time you think your 'nan could win the league in Scotland', please give us a break and remember many English players and managers (as well as other top internationals) have come up here and either struggled or failed completely. Also, we've all seen the videos of the crap atmospheres at Anfield, Old Trafford, Tottenham and Man City lately, and at least we still don't have half 'n' half scarves for tourists, and most of us are glad our clubs haven't sold out to oil money and the Super League. Please don't take this as anti-English or any of that pish, I'm just trying to highlight how much of a bratty Eton schoolboy you sound when you feel the need to tell us how bad our game is. We already know and we don't care what you think about it. 👍🤣	52.0	t3_190pcib	reddit

Bayern will never sanction a move for him, and I don't think Mbappe wants to go from one horse league to another. 2. Barca are broke, Atletico are not prestigious enough. 3. Serie A clubs like Juve, Inter, Milan also do not posses the financial muscle to afford him. 4. That leaves the PL clubs, among which United/Chelsea are too shit for him to consider, City has his rival Haaland playing, Arsenal has FFP issues, Spurs/Newcastle are not gonna entice him and that leaves only Liverpool! So its either moving to Madrid, staying at PSG or coming to Liverpool: 1. Scenario - stays at PSG: He's reaching the ceiling of his potential to grow in Ligue 1 away from worldwide attention and he needs to move in order to evolve as well as start increasing his legacy as a player if he truly wants to contend for one of the greatest players of all-time. 2. Scenario - comes to Liverpool: He will play in the most popular league in the world, with his rival Haaland against him for another title winning side of Man City, its the perfect blockbuster. --- Now comes the nightmare final scenario - Goes to Real Madrid: This is the last straw that will break things apart. If he goes there, then there is no side stopping Madrid to completely decimate the Europe for a decade to come. Real Madrid will have these players under their disposal if things go according to plan: - Mbappe (25) - Vini (23) - Rodrygo (23) - Endrick (17) - Bellingham (20) - Guler (18) - Valverde (25) - Tchouameni (23) - Camavinga (20) - Militao (25) - Davies (23) ? - Yoro (18) ? How is anyone in their wildest dream can compete against this monster team that will all come in their prime together while gelling on chemistry for decade to come? It will ruin the Champions League forever to Mercedes F1 levels. Mbappe, has to come to Liverpool.	32.0	t3_18zvhji	reddit

Europa League: Villarreal 13p (1), Real Betis 9p (3). EDIT: I stand corrected. Completely missed Sevilla. Honestly I was looking at the CL table and after counting four Spanish teams I stopped looking for more. Never thought about the situation they could have five teams in the CL. Damn. My bad.

61	Willian had the skillset, athleticism and work ethic to be a superstar but his decision making and game intelligence let him down so much.	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-04 04:09:30	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18y3uhg/willian_had_the_skillset_athleticism_and_work/	His talent work ethic and physical attributes are a major reason why he's still decent in the premier league at am advanced age. He was rapid, could stop and start on a dime, accelerated from a stop almost faster than anyone else I've seen, press resistant, great ball striking, good range of passing, high work rate but unfortunately he was just horrible at decision making and had mediocre in game intelligence. In his prime at chelsea he constantly constantly messed up counter attacks, had a very poor sense of positioning and making off ball runs, and despite being good at ball striking and having a great passing range lacked the vision to be a consistent creative outlet. This is one of the reasons why fans of other teams think he used to be great and chelsea fans used to not like him as much. He was genuinely skilled and super talented, just not the smartest guy on the pitch.	7.0	t3_18y3uhg	reddit

90	Eric Dier - what next for him?	Unknown	2023-12-29 16:06:37	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18tqirh/eric_dier_what_next_for_him/	As the title suggests. I wondered where people thought he may go next really. Thinking about what he offers - pretty much can only play in the centre of a three or possibly defensive midfield, which maybe means Italy or lower half prem teams, but none really play a back 3 in the prem atm. In terms of what he offers, you get a player with great leadership, really nice distribution short or long. Aerial ability perfectly decent but not a strong one on one tackler. On the downside I'm not sure how press resistant he is, he's slow which will be an issue to any team attempting a high line, and if he were to be moved into midfield it's a long time since he's played there so very much an unproven quantity. Can he do the stones style role of playing in a 4 and tucking in as part of a double pivot in possession? I'm not sure what his potential is picking up the ball on the half turn, and equally not sure he can still be a decent 6. I'm interested to know people's thoughts. I think he's got a lot of talent but maybe not specific traits that suit the modern game? The only top side in the prem playing a low block counter attack style that would suit him are united, and that would be a hugely long shot move. I'd be intrigued to know if he could play as a single pivot in a 433 but it's a long shot. What does everyone think?	1.0	t3_18tqirh	reddit

The amount of Multi-Club groups has grown at an accelerated pace the last few years, yet none of them seem to have some real differentiators apart from their ownership structure. Take City Football Group for example. Sure, they may have some of the current top Clubs around the world, like Manchester City and Girona, but the only real differentiator from other groups seems to be that they are owned by Abu Dhabi. My question is, do you think that there are any real differentiators to these groups? Is there any of them that actually justifies their existence by having something in their methodology that is doing things differently? What could potentially be a unique selling proposition from any of these groups, apart of the money that they offer to their previous owners?

99	Why don't we have a ratio of individual goals scored/team goals scored	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-27 12:43:28	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18rzvgu/why_dont_we_have_a_ratio_of_individual_goals/	"When we have discussion about players we always have raw stats (total of goals, assists and at best goals/assists per game, but i think it will be better to have goals/assists per minutes played) but we never have a ratio vs team goals scored. Some players really benefits from their teams style of play (Haaland for Man City for instance) but others don't (Hazard during his Chelsea time with a very defensive side). With expected goals/assists it kind of balance this problem but does not account for other factors. Example, if you play with Salah at Liverpool you know you will have more space because defenders will focus on him, even if they are far, they will keep an eye on him. Another exemple, if you play with very aggressive and technical players, you will have more penalties given to you and it increases your goals scored amount. So a bit of a controversial take to finish but if we take Messi and Ronaldo, I think that they had massively benefit, in terms of stats, from their superteam goal scoring machine but we never take that into account. Messi for Argentina : 0,58 goals per game VS Messi for Barcelona : 0,86 goals Ronaldo for Portugal : 0,62 goals per game Vs Ronaldo for Real Madrid : 1,03 goals per game Vs Ronaldo for Juventus : 0,75 goals per game Hazard for Chelsea : 0,31 goal per game (but to be fair he has also 0,26 assists per game) Torres for a defensive Liverpool Benitez side : 0,57 goals per game (just needed another exemple) We can see that it makes a huge difference, if we can have a ratio it will balance things out and helps us make better comparaison, some players stats are really helped by their teams offensive tactic, the players they play with, where they play (it is easier to score in Bundesliga), etc. I hope one day that we will have more context on stats in football, it really feels ""cheap"" and ""childish"" sometimes."	3.0	t3_18rzvgu	reddit

Vinicius Junior in 2018, Rodrygo in 2019, Eder Militao in 2019. Renier Jesus in 2020. And Endrick in 2022. The get all of these players before they become established stars and some like Vini and Rodrygo before Europe even. And the seeds gave fruit. Vini is now the world’s best winger and only cost €45 million. Rodrygo is a prolific and performing right winger and only cost €40 million. Eder Militao is a top 5 world center back and only cost like €50 million. Renier Jesus flopped hard and Endrick is yet to prove himself, but these investments have shown to have lots of worth. They were big factors in guiding Madrid to another UCL. Brazil + Real Madrid is becoming a brand. Is Man City trying this with Argentines? They signed Alvarez last year and he’s been performing brilliantly for them, he’s very similar to Rodrygo. They signed Perrone who is developing and have now signed Everechhi a highly talented wonder kid from Boca. They are also thinking of signing Barco. Do you guys think Man City is trying to build a reputation in a Football hotbed like Argentina (like how Real Madrid did in Brazil?) after all Alvarez said that it was the positive history of Argentines in man city like aguero and Zabaletta that lead him to choose them. What do you guys think? Man City and Real Madrid are the 2 best clubs in the world right now, and seem to have the market for 2 of footballs’s greatest hotbeds in the continent of South America.

The minute of silence for the death of the greatest football player of all time, in an empty stadium really gave me this feeling of ""it's over"".

Juventus, Milan, Barcelona, Man United, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Liverpool, for god's sake even Paris Saint Germain, all of them have been falling and falling, losing players, appeal, tradition, fans. The Messi and Ronaldo's era was quite long, and probably destroyed many other players in the meanwhile, but they were part of a larger design, they played against and with the likes of Nesta, Maldini, Scholes, Keane, Giggs, Ronaldinho, Cannavaro, Del Piero, Totti, Buffon and so on, leaving a permanent mark. The class of 90s has been quite disappointing and no one has really replaced the old legends, leaving a generational void. The super league, the downward spiral of certain domestic championships, the diminishing importance of the Champions League and the increase of black swans events like multiple balloon d'ors winners, repeted consecutive champions league winners, legends leaving their historical clubs or joining rivals or playing in Arabia for money, no players actually caring about glory, alongside the disillusion and diminishing cultural importance of the sport (younger generations care more about Fortnite thsn football) and the lack of personality by football figures have destroyed the beauty of this game.

104	Rodri is not as good as people claim he is	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-28 10:36:48	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18sqzu3/rodri_is_not_as_good_as_people_claim_he_is/	Before y'all down vote and comment to tell me I'm the dumbest mfer alive, hear me out. Rodri is undeniably a world class player. His ability to retain the ball is amazing. He can cope with being left all alone in midfield... Against weaker teams. Which is impressive, don't get me wrong. You can't expect a midfielder to hold the entire midfield of a top team alone. But here is my first problem with what people claim of Rodri. People pretend that Rodri single handedly bosses the midfield against top teams. And sure, he might have 1 game once in a while where he does that. Great players have great moments. But that does *not* mean he is capable of regularly doing that. In my opinion, no one is capable of regularly bossing a midfield around by themselves. Yet, mostly city fans to be fair, have been claiming this for a while and I'm getting quite tired of seeing it. No, Rodri vs the entire Arsenal midfield isn't going to win. He's not THAT good. My second complaint about what people say about Rodri is that he's better than Haaland or De Bruyne because City can win without either of them, but not without Rodri. And I'm sorry, but that's a non sequitur argument. A non sequitur argument is an argument where the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. Rodri being more important to that City team is the logical conclusion. Now you can argue that him being more important makes him better, but that I would disagree with also. I think Rodri is more important because of Pep's system requiring a DM, but they only have Rodri. Let me elaborate on that before you try to call me stupid though. Who do Manchester City have when Grealish is out? Doku and Foden. Who do City have when Haaland is out? Alvarez, potentially the third best striker in the world. Who do they have when Bernardo Silva is out? Again, Foden can play that position. Who do City have when Nunes or Kovacic are out? They have Rico Lewis. Who do Manchester City have to control the attack? When he's not injured, De Bruyne. Arguably the best creative midfielder in the world right now. Now don't get me wrong, not all players I have named are worldclass. But you would all agree with me if I said they are good enough at what they do to fall in, right? But who do City have as back up for Rodri? Philips... Kelvin Philips. So I really, truly, must beg the question whether Rodri is as important to City as he is because he's on level with Lothar Matthaus (I've seen some idiot actually claim this) or if it's because City have no back up DM. In my opinion, it's the latter. Again, Rodri is worldclass, but he's NOT the best player in the world. And no, him being more important for City than Haaland, when City have the third best striker in the world coming off the bench, is not a great argument for why he's *better*.	38.0	t3_18sqzu3	reddit

Unknown	2023-12-25 06:08:33	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18qcsnj/why_arent_there_more_top_goalkeepers_who_become/	"reasons why it feels like there should be more - 1 they're usually directing the players in defensive situations. 2 they get to see attacks from a vantage point that nobody else gets, which could teach them just as much about how to attack as it does for how to defend. 3 being exceptionally athletic is less of a requirement: it's rare to be tall+fast+strong+energy efficient. and it's rare to be intelligent. but it should be more difficult for top outfield players to become top managers as being athletic *and* intelligent is *really* rare. 4 unlike great forwards, they might be less frustrated as they can't just ""go in and do it themselves"", probably useful experience to have as a manager who needs to stand on the touch line for 90 minutes (ex: henry, but put your pitchforks down I'm an arsenal fan). one possible reason base rate fallacy (# of outfield players > # of goalkeepers in absolute numbers), but I'm specifically talking about top goalkeepers vs top outflelders and those numbers should be much closer. tldr why were none of bald fraud the first, gegengrinning, lego man and the other bald fraud goalkeepers when all of the coke gods and les henries forwards"	28.0	t3_18qcsnj	reddit

113	Why is Central America so bad at football	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-24 18:49:53	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18q18ne/why_is_central_america_so_bad_at_football/	Latin America is usually considered to be the most talented and football-obsessed region in the world, and while most of the attention is usually on South America, many people associate Central America with them. However, South America has many world cups, and is competitive on a national and league level. However, in CONCACAF Central America has 0 gold cups. Jamaica's been to 2 Gold cup Finals, winning none which is about the same as Central American nations. However, in the Caribbean, there are more popular sports such as Cricket and Athletics, in Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic Baseball is bigger. Mexico and USA dominate the Gold Cup and while Mexico is understandable, Football is only the 4th or 5th most popular sport in the USA, even Canada has 1 Gold Cup and hockey is the biggest sport there. On a Club level, they do not fare much better, with Mexico and USA dominating and Caribbean countries having a similar level of success as Central America except Costa Rica, which falls behind the USA and Mexico. I really do not understand why this happens, every reason I can think of also applies to many South American and other countries. for example, one could say Central American countries are poor and corrupt, but this is also the case in South America where football is arguably played at the highest average level &#x200B; The small population size can be blamed as Central America can be dwarfed in comparison to USA, Mexico and even Canada. However, this does not stop South America where the 2 largest countries are Brazil (by miles) and Argentina. However, Uruguay with about 2% of Brazils population has more Copa Americas and won the World Cup twice (was world champions 4 times). Furthermore, in the Copa America and club level all countries in South America are relatively competitive in CONMEBOL despite the population disparity, as all except for one have won the Copa America. Also as stated before, Caribbean countries have a similar population, on average less actually and this small population competes for bigger sports (in my country cricket). but play at a similar level to Central American nations in CONCACAF. To an extent, this population disparity exists in every region, but aside from Oceania when Australia was still in it, none are dominated by one country &#x200B; Maybe its because the domestic leagues are poor in comparison to South America and Europe, this may be true, as I heard in Central America professional leagues are not very developed, but they are much more developed compared to the Caribbean, in many of these countries teams don't have proper stadiums or even broadcasting, but still have similar levels of success in the CONCACAF champions league compared to Central America, except for Costa Rica as stated before. So while a lack of good leagues to develop players is a factor, it is a problem that is worse in other CONCACAF countries &#x200B; so please help me understand, why is Central America so bad at football despite being a nation where football is popular. in a region which is usually talented. By the way, no hate is intended, I still believe Central America is slightly better on average than the Caribbean but the reason I am making this is because I used to think Central America was on Par with Mexico and South American nations, but that is not the case.	63.0	t3_18q18ne	reddit

I feel as if puttimg him in a position where there isn't so much pressure on him to shoot rather than to make play could very well make his performance skyrocket. Looking back at a Joelinton heatmap circa 2019, we could see some form of echo between his performance and Højlund. Seeing as Højlund tends to make fast runs at the ball into the box and taking advantages of loose balls, considering a more playmaking CAM position could be a good call for ten Hag's Man United, which can take advantage of his spearing runs as well as his offensive awareness while easing some of the pressure for him to shoot and giving him more of an incentive to pass. This is just an opinion of mine, so please tell me what you think.	1.0	t3_18qfpp1	reddit

MetLife is accessible via public transport. Probably the best option, but it could have a weather issue due to it not having climate control in case of an emergency. Also time zones could mess with Europe, plus it isn’t central. Edit: nyc is no longer world’s capital Los Angeles, America’s 2nd biggest metro area and also very prevalent. Great football scene. SoFi is amazing, but isn’t mainly for soccer and that issue is still there. Probably would the be nearly the best venue but time zones once again could mess with TV viewership in optimizing this game for Europe means kick off will need to be at peak daytime which would be awful for the players. Dallas: least prevalent city of the 3, but has the biggest stadium in terms of capacity. Also is central, has climate control in the stadium to avoid all weather issues, and has time zones which work to make it so the game’s optimized for Europe but also is at afternoon for kick off so the players can have good conditions. Also Jerry Jones really wants this so he might put forth something extra.

Often Nottingham Forest games (don't talk to me about today) as my brother works there, but I've also been to many London clubs since moving to uni (Chelsea, Charlton, Millwall) as well as some random matches here and there (Blackburn, Stoke). There's nothing I love more than the matchday experience. The emanance of anticipation in the town centre, adhering to a trail of eager fans marching in droves to the stadium. The congregation in the pub catching the end of the half 12 kick, refreshing the socials to get team news. The pre-match music, walkouts, chanting, and everything that follows. Being from the North, I naturally also have a huge soft spot for any stadium that does chips and gravy. I'm a simple man. Sitting down at half time with chips and gravy observing the details of the stadium against a rusted and weathered seat, the scarf and food warming me up from the bitter 4pm Winter cold. I love it all. However, I don't drive. Though I live in London for uni, that'll get me a lot of opportunities to go to many clubs, and there's also good transport links from the city which'll make any stadium South of Birmingham relatively easy to access. However, trains are so very expensive, even with a railcard, and tickets can also be over £25 even for League Two clubs nowadays, let alone the hundred or so pounds you're paying for Prem clubs through third parties. Does anyone have any tips on accessing cheap tickets, especially for Premier League clubs? And also any tips for travelling around the country on matchday etc. Thank you.	4.0	t3_18pjmpe	reddit

Drew 0-0 at home I know Barca fans say oh the ref in the first leg was terrible as well, it’s no where near the same. To de bunk that rubbish - Etoo offside was extremely tight + he missed, - The Messi handball penalty shout is never a penalty he’s about a yard away, - The Henry penalty shout is softer than all of the ones Chelsea had turned down -Ballack red card (2 yellows) it was 2009 he would most likely be sent off today but back then probably not. 2nd leg where to start. They got bullied to begin with 2nd best all game. - Both handballs are the most obvious penalties of all time, - Abidal should’ve been sent off earlier for taking out drogba last man (no penalty again) - Malouda clearly fouled inside the box not outside What are your guys opinions?	37.0	t3_18otbjs	reddit

And the ref decided to give direct red card over to Fenerbahce's best player Fred in 90+13. He gave ''he called me stupid'' as a reason in field. After match while he giving report of the match he wrote down that Fred called him ''fucking stupid ref''. But the ref Zorbay Kucuk has failed the FIFA's english test in 2022, also Fred is not fluent with English, he might talked in Portuguese on field. Fred said that he only said ''thats stupid foul''. After all that drama Fenerbahce decided to make and objection to the red card to be cancelled because theres a biggest derby match on 24th of December. Also Fenerbahce has won every match with Fred and lost 3 match while Fred was injured. Lip readers and players around Fred has said that Fred didnt say any bad word to the ref. He was trying to call out that foul was stupid not the ref. Also calling stupid is not near to the bad word too.

However, it wasn't till I was maybe in my early to mid-teens that I took a 'die-hard' interest in the sport. So 2013 would have been either just before or around the time I got into the sport properly. The concept of Wigan Athletic winning the FA Cup by today's standards is almost impossible (I mean no offense Wigan fans). I was wondering, for those who remember it well, was it as shocking to you and other fans that they won the whole thing or were a brilliant team that has seemingly just lost their way over the last decade? &#x200B; TL:DR - Was Wigan winning the 2013 FA Cup shocking?	6.0	t3_18ov02t	reddit

Obviously the dutch league is more watchable for locals, but in terms of outside interest and competing in Europe they havent been great. Even when they get a great team the players get sold quickly. Atleast PSG tries to build around French nationals. They do bring top players the ligue 1 which makes the league more relevant. I guess its not good for locals, but in terms of outside interest i'd say its overall better for the league to have a top teams. Without Bayern Munich I think the Bundesliga would have issues drawing outside interest. Unfortunately you always need that core top team to make a league interesting.	18.0	t3_18o0hes	reddit		
145	"Unpopular opinion: ""English tax"" is a myth"	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-23 10:57:44	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18p3bi9/unpopular_opinion_english_tax_is_a_myth/	"Before instantly going to the replies and hating, actually hear me out first. A lot of people have been complaining about market values and players being ""overvalued"" (English players specifically). I'm not really convinced that ""English tax"" is actually real, people seem to ignore the fact that basically every single English player that a big club payed an excessively high price for came from a bottom half premier league club. For example Maguire to man united - leicester knew they could trick a big club with a lot of money into paying too much money for a mid player like maguire, so they did it and it worked. Same with grealish to city. People ""value"" grealish at about 30-40M - you really think villa were gonna let go of their best player that easily? again, no, they were a bottom half club at the time and if they can get our hands on 100M then they were going to do it. Same thing for the price that thomas Frank values ivan toney at. This also only applies to some English players. Most English players like Rice, Saka, Bellingham, Kane, Trent, Maddison, Stones, etc. have completely fair prices. And to prove it's not based on nationality, look at chelsea paying 80M for wesley fofana, is that ""french tax""? no, but if fofana was english everyone would be saying ""english tax"". Same thing with antony to man united, matheus nunes to man city, nicolas pepe to arsenal, enzo and caicedo to chelsea and richarlison to tottenham. Not denying that the prices are inflated, but it's for a good reason, it's smart business from bottom half clubs. And to respond to the argument that premier league clubs can only have a certain amount of foreign players so English players are in higher demand, other top leagues have similar policies so it sort of cancels it out. People also compare premier league transfers involving English players to transfers from la liga and Serie A, which is dumb because every league has a completely different financial status and la liga/serie A etc generally have less money flying around than the premier league, which is why transfers in those leagues tend to be for less. Yes there might be a mediocre english player being bought for more than an elite serie A player but it's not because of nationality. Also pretty strange that English players are the only players targeted when most big transfers dont involve english players. You dont get people going around saying ""spanish tax"" or ""brazilian tax"". I think ""english tax"" is a way for people to hate on english players or a term used because people don't understand how the transfer market works.One other thing that confuses me is why people care so much about market values, and why people say genuinely stupid things like ""This is the REAL market value of this player"" or ""This guy is not playing at the same level of his market value"". People sometimes need to just accept that the premier league clubs make more money than clubs from other leagues. People also love blaming English football fans for it. I'm sorry that nobody wants to watch las palmas vs rayo vallecano or salernitana vs genoa, what do you want us to do about it? They also exaggerate the extent to which players are inflated. I've seen some genuinely insane takes that seem to be driven by jealousy rather than actual logic, e.g. ""Rice doesn't start for a top 6 Serie A side"" ""The real value of the English national team is about the same as Denmark"" (to give you an idea of how insane that first take is, Bologna's (top 6 serie A side rn) DM is a Scottish player who struggles to get called up to their national team and if he does he gets benched for McTominay. TLDR: English players are SLLIGHTLY inflated (not to the ridiculous extent that everyone says they are), and it's not because of nationality, it's because they play in the league with the highest financial status."	20.0	t3_18p3bi9	reddit

Getting rid of it completely may be a mistake. Keeping it in its current form is a mistake. Proposal 1: -Both managers get one VAR challenge per game (NBA style). Game officiated as normal. If the manager thinks the ref or linesman have made an error, they notify the 4th official to do a review. If the manager is correct, they keep their VAR challenge. If they challenge again and the manager is wrong, they lose their challenge, and one potential substitute. Solution 2 -Officials can use VAR 3 times in total per game. Self explanatory, any other potential officiating errors we live with. Potential upsides: If managers disagree with a call, use your challenge rather than complaining about decisions during the game / post match etc. Game flows better, less anxiety after a goal goes in. Revert back to “attacker gets the benefit of the doubt” (unless of course VAR are going to review the decision). Less red card decisions will be slowed down (hopefully), as tackles will be evaluated in real time (unless challenged by the manager / VAR). What do you lot think? Surely we can improve VAR without doing away with it completely.	20.0	t3_18oc3gb	reddit

It was by a heartbreaking defeat by Fortaleza at their home ground sealed their fate in the second tier. I was left in absolute disbelief although it was seen coming. Fans especially in Brazil were left in agony as Santos lost to a last-minute winner, relegating them to 17th place. The aftermath is what was honestly sad. The pitch, once a place of celebration, became a canvas of hurt and rage and outside was cars burning and gases being thrown around including the pitch. To comprehend the depth of this sadness, In 1912 on the sandy shores of Brazil Santos FC emerged. The club's golden era in the 1950s, led by the legendary Pelé, who led them to three consecutive Copa Libertadores titles. Through the 21st century, Santos fostered talents like Neymar and Rodrygo who went out to become big superstars. The 2023 season saw President Andres Rueda's questionable recruitment decisions and a staggering 21 signings, disrupting the team's cohesion. As Botafogo's collapse allowed Palmeiras to seize the title, Santos faced dire consequences. Despite their undeniable prestige, Santos is now in the depths of the second division, no longer among Brazil's biggest clubs. There was a glimmer of hope this year with Marcos Leonardo, a 20-year-old striker who was going crazy in the league. Yet, even his departure signifies the harsh financial struggles post-relegation. As Santos FC confronts Serie B challenges, I hope they will bounce back from this set-back and go back into Serie A like many clubs have done. What do you guys think?

This will create a divide in Europe between: - Super League: Madrid, Barca, Atletico, Sevilla, Villarreal, Milan, Inter, Napoli, Roma, Juventus and others - Champions League: City, Arsenal, Liverpool, United, Newscastle, Bayern, Dortmund, Leipzig, PSG, and others.

The European clubs that have qualified for this tournament so far are Real Madrid, Man City, Bayern, PSG, Inter, Porto, Benfica, and Chelsea. On the other hand, this tournament will only add to the already overloaded football calendar. It will be interesting to see if clubs actually prioritize the 2025 CWC when the time comes, but I guess that will depend on the size of the prize pool.

163	I gave up sports betting 3 years ago but Premier League gambling ads are starting to genuinely tempt me and I’m getting sick of it.	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-18 13:03:25	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18l86t5/i_gave_up_sports_betting_3_years_ago_but_premier/	For clarity I was never an addict who sunk hundreds into a bet, but I became someone who couldn’t watch a single match without sticking a fiver or a tenner down to enjoy it. I couldn’t even watch my own club without first checking the odds and I’d often bet money in my overdraft to try and get out of it. I gave it up in 2021 as gambling during COVID felt like the last straw and I wasn’t really enjoying football anymore, just the betting side of things. Also as an up front disclaimer, I think gambling is a bit of fun for most people and I have nothing against it as an activity. But recently I’ve started to get the itch again and it’s all stemming from how much gambling firms can back football media. For example, I’ve just put the first episode of the Obi Mikel podcast on and without 20 seconds they’re thanking a betting company. The same with the Peter Crouch Friday pod, as they read out the Paddy Power odds for each score they predict and then discuss them. I most likely won’t go back to sports betting but what worries me is that I only had a small gambling problem and I’m being sucked in by all this sponsorship and promotions. I can’t imagine what’s it’s like for those with huge betting addictions and being hit in the face with odds and promotions when you just want to enjoy some football media feels like advertising cigarettes to asthmatics. I know the Premier League is going to phase out gambling shirt sponsors and hopefully halftime odds but feels like companies are easily finding their way around that and making gambling easier to advertise than ever. Also “please gamble responsibly” shouldn’t absolve businesses of responsibility. Anyone else feeling the pressure building quietly these days?	26.0	t3_18l86t5	reddit

The world cup is special because its every four years, simple as that. If it was every year it would lose alot of its relevance. I started watching soccer in 2006, and back then the wc felt huge. Since then its slowly declined in terms of talent for whatever reason. It seems like club football has risen in that time period, which is why this is a good time to make a revamped club world cup. I honestly believe that as long as the prize money isnt a rip off then teams all over will take this very seriously. Small teams definetly do take the current CWC seriously, with the new format we will see European teams do the same im sure of it. The mere fact that its every 4 years will make it huge. Im genuinely upset that Liverpool will not be involved in it. I believe this will become a global spectacle and well see everybody talking about it. I think the oppurtunity for non European teams to show off their skills will get people excited. As an American ill be very excited to see Seatlle sounders represent the usa, and im sure people from other countries will be very excited to see their own nations represented. You just know that any time a European club gets knocked out by somebody itll be an earthquake of excitement. This is very good for the sport, itll help grow non European football leagues interest because itll feel more relevant to win these competitions that qualify you.	31.0	t3_18md897	reddit

I just joined here. When I watch Leverkusen play it seems they're smoothly gliding on the pitch. No one really cares about their position. They make instant decisions (passing, positioning) depending on what's happening around them. I believe this is called relationalism, where teams don't really follow a structured positioning system on the pitch. Usually when teams play like this for example Girona, Real Madrid they do have defensive problems to an extent. They find it hard to defend transitions because the moment they lose the ball, their players are all over the pitch. But Leverkusen looks defensively solid too. I mean sure there are teams that run in behind their defensive highline using long balls but they somehow don't allow opponent to penetrate them through vertical ground passes. I wonder how they keep their shape. Any explanation about it would be helpful. Thanks	8.0	t3_18kn2ap	reddit

While Haaland's goal-scoring prowess is evident with a remarkable goal-per-game ratio, Ferguson could one day potentially reach these heights. Analyzing data from recent matches, Ferguson has clearly shown ability that he has what it takes to not only be an excpetional goal scorer but also a playmaker. His agility and ball control statistics compare favorably with Haaland's, suggesting a potential avenue for exploiting defensive vulnerabilities. By introducing an element of unpredictability, Ferguson may create situations where statistical advantages alone cannot fully capture the complexity of his gameplay. Moreover, in terms of adaptability, Ferguson has showcased a diverse set of skills, making it difficult for opponents to anticipate his moves. While Haaland's consistency and goal-scoring records are formidable, Ferguson's potential to redefine strategies and play with a certain unpredictability could be a key factor in surpassing expectations in the long run. It's an unconventional perspective, but in the world of football surprises often come from those who dare to challenge the norm.

But lately, when talking about the last 5 years or so, it’s just felt dead and predictable to watch. Champions League is probably the best example to explain this. The format was never that bad, but the same teams would either end up in the same groups, or the big clubs are given super easy picks compared to the smaller teams. The fact that the last 5 winners in the competition alone have been HUGE clubs should speak levels on how dead the contest is. You know who’s likely to make it to the knockouts before the matches have even begun. And then we have the leagues. I used to participate in gatekeeping the Premier League being the greatest league in the world, but at this point it’s become a farmers league just like the Bundesliga and Ligue 1. We seem to have lost the exctiement of not knowing who will win the leagues. In the top 6, i’m almost willing to bet my life savings you know who will most likely win each league. Another HUGE pet peeve is the amount of dives i see in matches now. It’s become a normalised behaviour. It honestly boils my blood to watch players act like they got hit by a sniperrifle, rather than actually go for the goal. Lastly, the amount of stubborness coming from the refs. I can’t speak for any other league but the prem, cause that’s where i see it occur a lot more often. Refs make a mistake, and rather than owning up to it by apologising, they punish players, managers and other staff for complaining. I don’t get it. We’re told we cry too much when their mistakes have literally changed the outcome of not only matches, but results towards the end of the season.

Quite a few EPL pundits say that Scholes was the best midfielder they ever saw in the EPL or they at least say he was the superior out of the Gerrard, Lampard, Scholes debate. These opinions are echoed by many spectators too. My question is, if Scholes was so great, how did Gerrard get in the PFA TOTY 8 times and Scholes only twice in a 20 year career? My understanding of this award is that a union of football experts compiles a list of players who are eligible and then the other players in the league vote on which of those players make the Team. So it would seem that in real time, most of the players around Scholes did not think he merited a spot in that team more than twice in 19 seasons in a team that won 12 titles in that period, but Gerrard did on 8 occasions. Even his own team mates such as Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt and Darren Fletcher made the team in years Scholes didn't. Yet today, people seem to speak with such detail when they talk about how good Scholes was. ""He controlled games, he was a metronome, he found space, you couldn't get the ball off him, he was the best passer I've ever seen, a great goal scorer"" etc. So if people can remember such specific detail all these years later, where were the votes when it was all going down? Is Scholes' reputation a product of rose-tinted glasses or are awards like this flawed in some way? Or has Scholes quality simply undergone a healthy reevaluation and people finally appreciate him the way they should have before?"	87.0	t3_18jtzb9	reddit

Club World Cup is happening right, the tournament used to have a predecessor called the Intercontinental Cup and it was seen also as the highest achievement possible for a club in Brazil. I gotta say, Is kinda amazing that brazilian clubs value this title that most of the time Europeans do not care. It's just a friendly match but in here if you don't have a trophy of this tournament you are not considered a big club. THIS IS the most overrated trophy in football. So many clubs in the 70's in Europe said no to the competition because well, gotta take that long travel and danger of violence. But in here, OMG. There are teams thay brag about winning this even though the opposite team were like flat out drunk and only played because they were in risk of punishment by UEFA, like Liverpool 81. I think Copa Libertadores should be considered the pinnacle of what South American Club can achive. Like Champions League in Europe.

I’m from the US, but here are my thoughts: The MLS had the most call ups at the 2022 World Cup outside of Europe’s top 5 leagues. The list goes: 1. Premier League 2. La Liga 3. Bundesliga 4. Serie A 5. Ligue 1 6. MLS I know that doesn’t necessarily mean anything, but I do think it’s significant. I still think the MLS is quite a ways away from being a league where true world class players play their primes of their careers here. For the foreseeable future it’ll be a league that consists of talented young players before making the jump to Europe, MLS lifers, and soon to be retirees looking to retire in Miami or LA. And no member of the USMNT player pool who is currently in a top 5 league in Europe (+Eredivisie) should come to play in the MLS. (Unless they’re struggling for playing time and just need see the field.) But what about a player like Mark McKenzie? Currently playing in Belgium. But are we at a point where playing in the MLS would actually be better for his development? (Also, yes, I know he’s maybe not the best example. He plays for one of the best teams in Belgium that is competing in Conference League. But I think it’s a discussion to be had.) As teams start to play in truly state of the art football specific stadiums, and the league has beefed up it’s marketing efforts - so game attendance and revenue are going up. The league uses a salary cap to maintain parity, but the salary cap continues to gradually rise each year. No rational MLS fan would argue that the league is even close to being as good as a top 5 European league. But I think it’s fair to say that the MLS is on the rise and deserves to be in the discussion of global football. Am I crazy? Also, I’m genuinely not trying to start any fights lol. Just looking for unbiased perspective on how the rest of the world views the MLS.	86.0	t3_18j0sxr	reddit

185	What if some club win Conference League, can start in Champions League qualifiers due to winning domestic league and get knocked out?	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-14 09:56:54	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18i5a6u/what_if_some_club_win_conference_league_can_start/	I'm curious about a hypothetical situation in UEFA competitions. Suppose a club from a country without a direct Champions League group stage slot wins both the Conference League and their national championship. If they then participate in the Champions League qualifiers but get knocked out in a round that's not the final one, what happens next? Would they still need to go through the remaining qualifiers, automatically enter the group stage due to their Conference League victory, or maybe even they lose their right to participate in the Champions League qualifiers at the start? I couldn't find specific information in UEFA's rules about this scenario.	9.0	t3_18i5a6u	reddit

They also had the strongest front three in history perhaps. Solid defense still with a strong Umtiti who was wanted by United and even Madrid at the time of his signing in 2015. Young Piqué was there, Alves still running up and down the right side, young 28yo Messi, 28yo Suarez and 24 year old Neymar. They had an aging Iniesta who was at the top of his game until 2018 probably and had no good replacements for defense and strikers when MSN or Piqué were out. What went wrong especially in the seasons 2015-2016, 2016-17, and 2018-19. I think 1-2 UCLs were attainable there and not so far fetched. What went wrong, in your opinion?	128.0	t3_18h9ncs	reddit

He lived a crazy life with no self care, and was a bad motivation and influence to other teammates He won a World Cup and scored a goal with his hand which change the complete game and then had the audacity to admit he did it with his hands after he pretended for years he didn’t.

I watched the FIFA WC final (everyone did lol) and that was the first football match I watched throughout and absolutely loved every second of it. There was suspense and everything, and at the end the team I supported won so I was a happy guy. Actually not long before that my team (Pakistan) just lost the Cricket WC final against England so the FIFA win just made me feel better. Anyway, here are the Questions: 1: What is offside? I've watched many videos explaining it but don't quite understand what it means. 2: is it a goal if the ball is hit and it gets in the goal line but doesn't hit the net while mid air? Or is it a goal only when the ball is grounded in the goal line but doesn't hit the net? 3: Does it not waste time when the team celebrates? The timer still goes on after the goal while the team is celebrating so it does waste time in which maybe another goal can be scored by the opposing team to win a match. Is there a limit to the time you can celebrate? Yep that's it.	6.0	t3_18ha1a2	reddit

Unknown	2023-12-12 09:08:20	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18ght7j/why_did_michael_laudrup_never_go_on_to_become_an/	For those who remember Swansea’s 2012-13 season, Michael Laudrup had them playing some of the most exciting football in the League with some excellent players like Michu, Fernandez, De Guzman, Ki Sung-yueng. They famously won the League Cup, beat multiple top 6 teams and gave some iconic performances (The 2-0 against Arsenal away was a brilliant display). Next season, they give it a good go in the Europa, beating Valencia 3-0 away. Then Swansea go on a poor run of form, and Laudrup is sacked probably prematurely. And then… nothing? He goes to manage in Qatar for a few years and then seemingly has become unemployed since 2018. Is it the case Laudrup just gave up on management or did nobody really want him?	19.0	t3_18ght7j	reddit

I know there are a few of these but searched google with ‘Reddit’ and the majority of season predictions were from the start of this year so what are people’s thoughts as we approach the half way stage? I have a selfish reason for asking and appreciate this isn’t a gambling sub but each year, for Christmas, my brother and I give each other £30 worth of bets instead of presents and so I’m interested in everyone’s ideas. The bets can be anything. Any sport. Any type of bet. If there is a market, then it is fair game, but as this is a football sub I’ll start with some of my stupid predictions: - Jude Bellingham to win Balloon Doors (3-1/favourite) - Arsenal to win Champs league (8-1 / third favourite - a punt. Athough I don’t think they have the squad to win the Prem they can beat anyone on their day and have seemed to have found a way to win) - Mo Salah top goalscorer in the Prem (9-1, long shot. Foolish to bet against the beast but I’m betting that Haarland is plagued by injury woes like he was at Dortmund. Haarland has 14 goals, Mo, 11). - Brentford to be relegated (46-1, setting money on fire, but I look at everyone’s favourite moneyball squad and it looks pretty ropey to me. No Toney obvs. Can’t see them spending a lot in the window and their analytical edge erodes with each passing season. To be clear, I really don’t think Brentford will be relegated, there are worst teams than them in the Prem, but they are a lot shorter than 46-1 IMO. Anyhow, interested in your predictions. Any league, Euros, Olympics, anything! The obvious and the silly.	2.0	t3_18gwbcl	reddit

He seemed to have great awareness in/around penalty which difficult skill to master. However, I’ve to say he’s heavily overhyped. Jude isn’t that kinda of footballer that will get you off your couch like Zidane, Kaka, Messi, Ronaldinho, Bergkamp, etc did during their time. Jamal Musiala is the only one that’s probably close to these footballers, but you don’t hear his hype as much as Jude. Musiala can dance through the whole midfield and defense. However, Madrid PR make you believe that Jude is on that kind of level where he’s bang average when he doesn’t score. What’s your take on Jude? Edit - why is everyone mad here? Ain’t nobody say anything bad about Jude, but facts. He’s good football and scores goals but he ain’t no fucking Jamal Musiala! Most of you won’t even tell the difference between Jude and Ceballos when his purple patch ends.	27.0	t3_18gvpv8	reddit		
208	A year after the interview, I still think Ronaldo is still in the wrong and wouldn't have helped at all in Man U's current situation.	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-12 05:48:33	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18gey47/a_year_after_the_interview_i_still_think_ronaldo/	"Sorry in advance for the crappy grammar and questionable writing (also long) and the questionable take on the whole thing. I wanna see your opinion on this. &#x200B; Even though, Man United are in a kind of rough patch currently, I don't think Ronaldo could do anything if he was at the club. I find it baffling that people would think he was right and that if he stayed then he would do better. Even when he was at United, he couldn't carry them to glory. In fact, he was pretty bad in the few months before the World Cup. He was missing open goal opportunities against ammonia nicosia or something like that, a team in Cyprus. He deserved to get benched because of his poor performances and also to give the other players their chance to shine. His ego got in the way and he refused to get subbed in and left the game. I also found his 18 goal 3rd place top scorer thing to be overrated as the entire team was passing the ball to him instead of the team passing the ball to each other. He also scored mostly against the bottlers Spurs and lower teams like Norwich. I think ETH was right to suspend him when he left the game after having his little shitty attitude. I also think kicking Ronaldo out of the club was the right decision. Like who in the world would keep him after the interview. He did make some good points but still it was a horrible idea. I don't understand how people were like, ""Ronaldo is bigger than Man United."" Like in my opinion it's bullshit. They think him talking shit about the club and its staff (some true ngl) makes him right. Today, Ronaldo is doing pretty well in Saudi Pro League which is great for him. In fact, he reaches 50 goals. Like ya omg he's still a goalscoring machine, but holy shit remember he's in the saudi league. Like it isn't the worst league but it's fodder compared to the european league. Some people are like, ""Benzema and Mitrovic are struggling"", I find that's not a good point as basically they are in there for the money and retirement basically. They are also not doing that bad either. With Ronaldo doing so well abroad, people were also looking man u to see how the team's performing. With how man u is handling things, it seems that many people think that Ronaldo was right entirely and that ETH is a fraud. First thing is that Man u is shit but not as shit as people would think. Man U imo are still in contention for top 4 if you ignored the bournemouth game they were 3 points off of Man city. Secondly, their UCL campaign was horrible but mainly because of Onana. They scored the most in their group (12 to bayern's 11) but conceded the most goals (14) too. Third Man U is still rebuilding of course you're not gonna expect results right away. Look at Arteta with Arsenal, 4 years while it's Ten hag's second year and they already got 3rd place and the carabao cup."	15.0	t3_18gey47	reddit

If we look at their underlying numbers (https://understat.com/league/EPL) the xPTS has them at 6th not 13th, which would be an acceptable position for a team in their situation in my opinion. But does this matter? How does xPTS effect the long term? Is their any evidence to show eventually the reality matches the expected? Can a big difference remain between expected and reality or will it eventually even itself out with the potential for the team to catch up to its expected points or regress the expected points to its current situation. If a team wants to finish 6th and the underlying numbers suggest they should be 6th, despite being 13th in reality. Should a team keep everything the same and ignore the noise?	2.0	t3_18fu63a	reddit

212	Do Man Utd even have any players that are top 4 in their position ITL?	Unknown	2023-12-10 19:53:55	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18fbrvk/do_man_utd_even_have_any_players_that_are_top_4/	Do Man Utd even have any players that are top 4 in their position in this league? I think we Utd fans are being too demanding on Ten Hag based on the players he has. People can say he spent 400M$ and none of his players are working, but that’s a whole different story. Onana: Bad start Hojlund: Promising, no service Mount: Flop so far Casemiro: Great, slow start this season Antony: Noy great so far, I see the plan these last few games, not worth 90M. But back to my point, who on the Man Utd is top 4 or even top 6 in their position across the league? I think only Shaw (LB) and Bruno (CAM) are. A lot of the squad is deadwood and players on high wages that aren’t good enough. I think if we give Ten Hag another year or two with a competent board, the rebuild will work and we can finally become a consistent top 4 side.	19.0	t3_18fbrvk	reddit

223	Mudryk is 100% not as bad as people are claiming. I see a player who is monstrously skilled but with limited footballing education and lack of fundamentals, both factors which can easily be improved with good coaching and time.	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-08 18:06:37	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18dspkl/mudryk_is_100_not_as_bad_as_people_are_claiming_i/	The dude played in Ukraine till he was 21 and had a relatively late start to professional football. He was wrecking havoc in the Ukrainian league off pure pace, physicality and skill alone and has literally never needed to learn the fundamentals. Now hes thrown into the deep end at chelsea and people are eating him up. I get it. No one has time to watch him play every game(I do), and look at the horrible lowlights he does make here and there, but thats just piss poor PR. The truth? He has so much to learn, but he also already has so much that can never be taught. Things he lacks - Off ball positioning, being ready to receive the ball, decision making in transition, when and where to attempt take ons, ruthlessness in front of goal, demanding the ball and other intangibles. Will he ever become world class at these intangibles? likely not, but even being average at them could go a long way. But some of the skills and talent he does have? Lightning pace, 2 foot ability, excellent ball striking, transition dribbling, crossing, passing(especially that reverse through ball he likes to do which ive never seen him make an incomplete pass from). Despite his weaknesses and horrible low moments, he is also guaranteed to have a couple of high moments a game off pure skill and talent alone. his last few starts for example vs United - assist vs Brighton - Penalty won vs Arsenal - penalty won and goal vs Fulham - Goal hes only started 6 games btw and has somehow been key in all these games. Also to note when hes brought on as a sub, the vast majority of the time we are chasing a game and the other team closes shop and the entire team is clueless on breaking down these low blocks and Mudryk is the only one scape goated by chelsea fans. NO guarantee he will be a star player but I really believe in his talent and skill and am confident a good coach will get the best out of him.	76.0	t3_18dspkl	reddit

I think the manager, a man from Germany named Roger Schmidt, is one of the worst that my team had, for example, we have a very good player named Tiago Gouveia that hasnt played a lot, also he never does substitutions until the 80th minute and when he does that he replaces the best players like João Neves, also he brought to the team players that havent done anything like Arthur Cabral.

One day I just decided to wake up and fall in love to the football I'm still thinking how am I wasn't able to met with this sport earlier, my life could have been way different. Now I'm 20 years old, well I don't aim for top leagues but I genuinely want to make progress. But as you see from the topic I'm a total newbie. First of all, I'd like to tell you my physical and position. I'm 5'11 (1.80m) and 175 lbs (80 kg), my preferred position is forward (I'm not telling this to sound cool but after trying every position including goal keeper I've decided that.) During weekly matches that we do between I create my way to the goal through brute force and high speed, I have zero technique just playing raw strength. Now here's my questions: Technique: I have none, can't even juggle the ball for 5-6 times nor can dribble. But those stuff that I believe I can learn from internet my main question would be how I should work on my weak left foot. When I work on my feet should I treat both of them same or should I mostly focus to my strong foot %60 right %40 left for an example or all equal such as if I can juggle 5 with right, should do 5 with left as well. Vision: I've always wondered how players use their eyes for my way I look to the corner that I want to shoot then I look to my feet to set up my support leg and shoot. I have no idea if it's right or not sometimes I feel it's ok sometimes I don't, would like to hear you guys opinion. Program: I'm too broke to sign up to the gym so here's my plan: Tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday home workout without any equipments and sunday for stamina/control training on pitch that's the most I can do unfortunately. So here's my question, would one day stamina training per week on pitch would help? Should I do ball training after stamina training? These are mostly things on my mind. Thanks for reading my long post I appreciate to anyone who help, I'll also listen if you have any suggestions as well.	12.0	t3_18doye2	reddit

I mean, just in the Premier League - Tottenham, Newcastle, Man City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Brighton have key players out for the season and massive holes in their team and needed backups. Then we get to teams like Dortmund and Girona who will want to bolster their teams for the latter end of the season where they hope they can go further in the CL and LaLiga respectively. Not to mention the players available in January that many clubs will take, regardless of how many they already have. There’s no way, I think, this transfer window goes by without one big signing for the majority of clubs involved.	20.0	t3_18cxe1v	reddit

Second season 20 goals and 11 assists . Back to alti Frist season 9 Goals and 3 assist. Second season 15 goals 16 assist just in la Liga .

Against arsenal,utd city,liverpool and chelsea(I have not seen all their matches against small teams) they have been very lucky to get results in each of those matches whatever points they gained was not because of how well they played but because the other team missed their chances. They cannot play out from the back against a press and they cannot defend well even with their first choice backline in the sense that they always give too many chances to the other team.

I am asking this on a deeper level, and i am curious if someone has insights.	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-06 10:04:37	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18c0shl/what_is_the_primary_reason_why_for_example_a_3/	It is very important that i frame this question correctly, because i dont want to provoke „come on man this is obvious“ answers. Its very important that you understand what i am saying. A 3 League in a good Football country is still professional, someone who plays football in Germanys 3 division is a full time pro. He trains the same amount, has a strict diet, and everything is very similar if you compare it to a team like bayern. All Players are full time pros. My question is now (if we compare it to a team like bayern) why is the skill gap so so big? What is the reason? Dont get me wrong i know talent is a thing, but even 3 league players have very good fundamentals and have a fantastic first touch and everything, this arent sunday league bums where a fantastic first touch is a rare occasion. Fitness also doesnt make sense, both teams train fully and have a strict schedule. Is it the coaching? Is it small things that add up? What is the reason why real madrid can destroy a full pro side 7-0 if they feel like it? What exact aspect is so superior that they can literally obliterate the opponents? I know upsets happen but i want to know why in general the 3rd league side cant compete. I can see why a better pro side can dominate slightly, this can be given to slightly better fitness, bit more talent, a bit more coaching, but i dont see how a full pro side cant compete against another pro side. Like 6-0 runouts with 0 shots on target kinda games. Thank you.	56.0	t3_18c0shl	reddit

250	Network analysis of the worldwide footballer transfer market	Ming-Xia Li	2018-11-01 10:16:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00300v1	The transfer of football players is an important part in football games. Most studies on the transfer of football players focus on the transfer system and transfer fees but not on the transfer behavior itself. Based on the 470,792 transfer records from 1990 to 2016 among 23,605 football clubs in 206 countries and regions, we construct a directed footballer transfer network (FTN), where the nodes are the football clubs and the links correspond to the footballer transfers. A systemic analysis is conduced on the topological properties of the FTN. We find that the in-degrees, out-degrees, in-strengths and out-strengths of nodes follow bimodal distributions (a power law with exponential decay), while the distribution of link weights has a power-law tail. We further figure out the correlations between node degrees, node strengths and link weights. We also investigate the general characteristics of different measures of network centrality. Our network analysis of the global footballer transfer market sheds new lights into the investigation of the characteristics of transfer activities.			arxiv	['Wei-Xing Zhou', 'H. Eugene Stanley']	1.0
251	Networks of international football: communities, evolution and globalization of the game	Yang Li	2022-05-21 13:43:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10599v1	As the most popular sport around the globe, the game of football has recently intrigued much research interest to explore and distill useful and appealing information from the sport. Network science and graph-centric methods have been previously applied to study the importance of football players and teams. In this paper, for the first time we study the macroscopic evolution of the football society from a complex network point of view. Football game records within a time window of over a century were collected and expressed in a graph format, where participant teams are represented by graph nodes and the games between them are the graph edges. We carry out community detection and temporal analysis to reveal the dynamic features and the community structures embedded within the football network, offering the evidence of a continuously expanding football society. Spatio-temporal analysis is also implemented to unveil the temporal states that represent distinct development stages in the football history. Our analysis suggests that the evolution of the game receives considerable impact not only from major sport events, but also from multiple social and political incidents. The game of football and its evolution reflect significant historical transitions and turning points, and can provide a novel perspective for the study of the worldwide globalization process.			arxiv	['Gonzalo Mateos']	2.0

We also give examples showing that the corresponding result is not true for footballs of higher genera. Moreover, we classify the possible pairs (k,l) for which football patterns on the sphere exist satisfying a natural generalisation of the usual incidence relation between pentagons and hexagons to k-gons and l-gons.			arxiv	['D.

Excellent forecasts can be achieved by advanced machine learning methods applied to detailed historical data, especially in very popular sports such as football (soccer). Here we show that, despite the large number of confounding factors, the results of a football team in longer competitions (e.g., a national league) follow a basically linear trend useful for predictive purposes, too. In support of this claim, we present a set of experiments of linear regression on a database collecting the yearly results of 707 teams playing in 22 divisions from 11 countries, in 20 football seasons.			arxiv	[]	6.0

The network was optimized by experimenting with different activation functions, number of neurons and layers, learning rate and its decay, Nesterov momentum based stochastic gradient descent, L2 regularization, and early stopping. Simultaneous exploration of various aspects of neural network training is performed and their trade-offs are investigated. Our final model achieves a top-5 accuracy of 87.2% among 119 pricing categories, and places any footballer within 6.32% of his actual price on average.			arxiv	[]	7.0
257	Predictive modelling of football injuries	Stylianos Kampakis	2016-09-20 11:58:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07480v1	The goal of this thesis is to investigate the potential of predictive modelling for football injuries. This work was conducted in close collaboration with Tottenham Hotspurs FC (THFC), the PGA European tour and the participation of Wolverhampton Wanderers (WW). Three investigations were conducted: 1. Predicting the recovery time of football injuries using the UEFA injury recordings: The UEFA recordings is a common standard for recording injuries in professional football. For this investigation, three datasets of UEFA injury recordings were available. Different machine learning algorithms were used in order to build a predictive model. The performance of the machine learning models is then improved by using feature selection conducted through correlation-based subset feature selection and random forests. 2. Predicting injuries in professional football using exposure records: The relationship between exposure (in training hours and match hours) in professional football athletes and injury incidence was studied. A common problem in football is understanding how the training schedule of an athlete can affect the chance of him getting injured. The task was to predict the number of days a player can train before he gets injured. 3. Predicting intrinsic injury incidence using in-training GPS measurements: A significant percentage of football injuries can be attributed to overtraining and fatigue. GPS data collected during training sessions might provide indicators of fatigue, or might be used to detect very intense training sessions which can lead to overtraining. This research used GPS data gathered during training sessions of the first team of THFC, in order to predict whether an injury would take place during a week.			arxiv	[]	8.0
258	Explaining the difference between men's and women's football	Luca Pappalardo	2021-01-05 17:25:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01662v1	Women's football is gaining supporters and practitioners worldwide, raising questions about what the differences are with men's football. While the two sports are often compared based on the players' physical attributes, we analyze the spatio-temporal events during matches in the last World Cups to compare male and female teams based on their technical performance. We train an artificial intelligence model to recognize if a team is male or female based on variables that describe a match's playing intensity, accuracy, and performance quality. Our model accurately distinguishes between men's and women's football, revealing crucial technical differences, which we investigate through the extraction of explanations from the classifier's decisions. The differences between men's and women's football are rooted in play accuracy, the recovery time of ball possession, and the players' performance quality. Our methodology may help journalists and fans understand what makes women's football a distinct sport and coaches design tactics tailored to female teams.			arxiv	['Alessio Rossi', 'Giuseppe Pontillo', 'Michela Natilli', 'Paolo Cintia']	9.0

An analysis of RL and real-world football strategies	Atom Scott	2021-11-24 08:44:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12340v1	Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have made it possible to develop sophisticated agents that excel in a wide range of applications. Simulations using such agents can provide valuable information in scenarios that are difficult to scientifically experiment in the real world. In this paper, we examine the play-style characteristics of football RL agents and uncover how strategies may develop during training. The learnt strategies are then compared with those of real football players. We explore what can be learnt from the use of simulated environments by using aggregated statistics and social network analysis (SNA). As a result, we found that (1) there are strong correlations between the competitiveness of an agent and various SNA metrics and (2) aspects of the RL agents play style become similar to real world footballers as the agent becomes more competitive. We discuss further advances that may be necessary to improve our understanding necessary to fully utilise RL for the analysis of football.			arxiv	['Keisuke Fujii', 'Masaki Onishi']	10.0

Yeung	2023-02-18 10:02:45	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09276v1	With recently available football match event data that record the details of football matches, analysts and researchers have a great opportunity to develop new performance metrics, gain insight, and evaluate key performance. However, most sports sequential events modeling methods and performance metrics approaches could be incomprehensive in dealing with such large-scale spatiotemporal data (in particular, temporal process), thereby necessitating a more comprehensive spatiotemporal model and a holistic performance metric. To this end, we proposed the Transformer-Based Neural Marked Spatio Temporal Point Process (NMSTPP) model for football event data based on the neural temporal point processes (NTPP) framework. In the experiments, our model outperformed the prediction performance of the baseline models. Furthermore, we proposed the holistic possession utilization score (HPUS) metric for a more comprehensive football possession analysis. For verification, we examined the relationship with football teams' final ranking, average goal score, and average xG over a season. It was observed that the average HPUS showed significant correlations regardless of not using goal and details of shot information. Furthermore, we show HPUS examples in analyzing possessions, matches, and between matches.			arxiv	['Tony Sit', 'Keisuke Fujii']	11.0
261	Machine Learning Modeling to Evaluate the Value of Football Players	Chenyao Li	2022-07-22 22:34:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11361v1	In most sports, especially football, most coaches and analysts search for key performance indicators using notational analysis. This method utilizes a statistical summary of events based on video footage and numerical records of goal scores. Unfortunately, this approach is now obsolete owing to the continuous evolutionary increase in technology that simplifies the analysis of more complex process variables through machine learning (ML). Machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), uses algorithms to detect meaningful patterns and define a structure based on positional data. This research investigates a new method to evaluate the value of current football players, based on establishing the machine learning models to investigate the relations among the various features of players, the salary of players, and the market value of players. The data of the football players used for this project is from several football websites. The data on the salary of football players will be the proxy for evaluating the value of players, and other features will be used to establish and train the ML model for predicting the suitable salary for the players. The motivation is to explore what are the relations between different features of football players and their salaries - how each feature affects their salaries, or which are the most important features to affect the salary? Although many standards can reflect the value of football players, the salary of the players is one of the most intuitive and crucial indexes, so this study will use the salary of players as the proxy to evaluate their value. Moreover, many features of players can affect the valuation of the football players, but the value of players is mainly decided by three types of factors: basic characteristics, performance on the court, and achievements at the club.			arxiv	['Stylianos Kampakis', 'Philip Treleaven']	12.0
262	On the flight of an American Football	Curtis Horn	2007-06-04 18:34:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0366v1	In this paper we examine the detailed theory of the American football in flight, with spin and air resistance included. We find the theory has much in common with the theory of a gyroscope and also rocket trajectory with a misaligned thruster. Unfortunately most of the air resistance data, for rocketry and ballistics, is for speeds of Mach 1 or higher, where the air resistance increases dramatically. We shall approximate a realistic air resistance, at the slower speeds of football flight, with a drag force proportional to cross sectional area and either $v$ or $v^2$, depending on speed, where $v$ is velocity of the football. We begin with a discussion of the motion, giving as much detail as possible without the use of complex analytic calculations. We point out the previous errors made with moments of inertia and make the necessary corrections for more accurate results. We show that the shape of an American football closely resembles a parabola of revolution.			arxiv	['Heidi Fearn']	13.0
263	Using Twitter to predict football outcomes	Stylianos Kampakis	2014-11-05 11:50:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1243v1	Twitter has been proven to be a notable source for predictive modelling on various domains such as the stock market, the dissemination of diseases or sports outcomes. However, such a study has not been conducted in football (soccer) so far. The purpose of this research was to study whether data mined from Twitter can be used for this purpose. We built a set of predictive models for the outcome of football games of the English Premier League for a 3 month period based on tweets and we studied whether these models can overcome predictive models which use only historical data and simple football statistics. Moreover, combined models are constructed using both Twitter and historical data. The final results indicate that data mined from Twitter can indeed be a useful source for predicting games in the Premier League. The final Twitter-based model performs significantly better than chance when measured by Cohen's kappa and is comparable to the model that uses simple statistics and historical data. Combining both models raises the performance higher than it was achieved by each individual model. Thereby, this study provides evidence that Twitter derived features can indeed provide useful information for the prediction of football (soccer) outcomes.			arxiv	['Andreas Adamides']	14.0

In addition, it provides support for multiplayer and multi-agent experiments. We propose three full-game scenarios of varying difficulty with the Football Benchmarks and report baseline results for three commonly used reinforcement algorithms (IMPALA, PPO, and Ape-X DQN). We also provide a diverse set of simpler scenarios with the Football Academy and showcase several promising research directions.			arxiv	['Anton Raichuk', 'Piotr Stańczyk', 'Michał Zając', 'Olivier Bachem', 'Lasse Espeholt', 'Carlos Riquelme', 'Damien Vincent', 'Marcin Michalski', 'Olivier Bousquet', 'Sylvain Gelly']	15.0
265	A mathematical take on the competitive balance of a football league	Soudeep Deb	2021-02-18 12:06:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09288v1	Competitive balance in a football league is extremely important from the perspective of economic growth of the industry. Many researchers have earlier proposed different measures of competitive balance, which are primarily adapted from the standard economic theory. However, these measures fail to capture the finer nuances of the game. In this work, we discuss a new framework which is more suitable for a football league. First, we present a mathematical proof of an ideal situation where a football league becomes perfectly balanced. Next, a goal based index for competitive balance is developed. We present relevant theoretical results and show how the proposed index can be used to formally test for the presence of imbalance. The methods are implemented on the data from top five European leagues, and it shows that the new approach can better explain the changes in the seasonal competitive balance of the leagues. Further, using appropriate panel data models, we show that the proposed index is more suitable to analyze the variability in total revenues of the football leagues.			arxiv	[]	16.0

Chacoma	2021-04-20 22:30:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10272v2	In this paper, we study collective interaction dynamics emerging in the game of football-soccer. To do so, we surveyed a database containing body-sensors traces measured during three professional football matches, where we observed statistical patterns that we used to propose a stochastic model for the players' motion in the field. The model, which is based on linear interactions, captures in good approximation the spatiotemporal dynamics of a football team. Our theoretical framework, therefore, becomes an effective analytical tool to uncover the underlying cooperative mechanisms behind the complexity of football plays. Moreover, we showed that it can provide handy theoretical support for coaches to evaluate teams' and players' performances in both training sessions and competitive scenarios.			arxiv	['N.

Our goal is to characterize statistically the temporal sequence of ball movements in this collective sport game, searching for traits of complex behavior. Data were collected over a variety of matches in South American, European and World championships throughout 2005 and 2006. We show that the statistics of ball touches presents power-law tails and can be described by $q$-gamma distributions. To explain such behavior we propose a model that provides information on the characteristics of football dynamics. Furthermore, we discuss the statistics of duration of out-of-play intervals, not directly related to the previous scenario.			arxiv	['L. C. Malacarne', 'C. Anteneodo']	19.0

We also provide a goodness of fit measure. Our results show that multinomial-Dirichlet models are not only competitive with standard approaches, but they are also well calibrated and present reasonable goodness of fit.			arxiv	['Rafael Izbicki', 'Danilo Lopes', 'Luis Ernesto Salasar']	20.0

Despite the strong connection existing between football models and the bookmakers' betting odds, no authors have used the latter for improving the fit and the predictive accuracy of these models. We have developed a hierarchical Bayesian Poisson model in which the scoring rates of the teams are convex combinations of parameters estimated from historical data and the additional source of the betting odds. We apply our analysis to a nine-year dataset of the most popular European leagues in order to predict match outcomes for their tenth seasons. In this paper, we provide numerical and graphical checks for our model.			arxiv	['Francesco Pauli', 'Nicola Torelli']	21.0

To gain insights into the general level of their candidate reinforcements, many professional football clubs have access to extensive video footage and advanced statistics. However, the question whether a given player would fit the team's playing style often still remains unanswered. In this paper, we aim to bridge that gap by proposing a set of 21 player roles and introducing a method for automatically identifying the most applicable roles for each player from play-by-play event data collected during matches.			arxiv	['Jan Van Haaren']	22.0

Existing methods for player evaluation in football depend heavily on proprietary data, are not reproducible, and lag behind those of other major sports. We present four contributions to the study of football statistics in order to address these issues. First, we develop the R package nflscrapR to provide easy access to publicly available play-by-play data from the National Football League (NFL) dating back to 2009. Second, we introduce a novel multinomial logistic regression approach for estimating the expected points for each play. Third, we use the expected points as input into a generalized additive model for estimating the win probability for each play. Fourth, we introduce our nflWAR framework, using multilevel models to isolate the contributions of individual offensive skill players, and providing estimates for their individual wins above replacement (WAR). We estimate the uncertainty in each player's WAR through a resampling approach specifically designed for football, and we present these results for the 2017 NFL season. We discuss how our reproducible WAR framework, built entirely on publicly available data, can be easily extended to estimate WAR for players at any position, provided that researchers have access to data specifying which players are on the field during each play. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this work for NFL teams.			arxiv	['Samuel Ventura', 'Maksim Horowitz']	26.0

Gaulton	2019-02-26 18:33:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10106v1	American football is the most popular high school sport and is among the leading cause of injury among adolescents. While there has been considerable recent attention on the link between football and cognitive decline, there is also evidence of higher than expected rates of pain, obesity, and lower quality of life among former professional players, either as a result of repetitive head injury or through different mechanisms. Previously hidden downstream effects of playing football may have far-reaching public health implications for participants in youth and high school football programs. Our proposed study is a retrospective observational study that compares 1,153 high school males who played varsity football with 2,751 male students who did not. 1,951 of the control subjects did not play any sport and the remaining 800 controls played a non-contact sport. Our primary outcome is self-rated health measured at age 65. To control for potential confounders, we adjust for pre-exposure covariates with matching and model-based covariance adjustment. We will conduct an ordered testing procedure designed to use the full pool of 2,751 controls while also controlling for possible unmeasured differences between students who played sports and those who did not. We will quantitatively assess the sensitivity of the results to potential unmeasured confounding. The study will also assess secondary outcomes of pain, difficulty with activities of daily living, and obesity, as these are both important to individual well-being and have public health relevance.			arxiv	['Sameer K.

277	Going Deep: Models for Continuous-Time Within-Play Valuation of Game Outcomes in American Football with Tracking Data	Ronald Yurko	2019-06-05 00:21:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01760v3	Continuous-time assessments of game outcomes in sports have become increasingly common in the last decade. In American football, only discrete-time estimates of play value were possible, since the most advanced public football datasets were recorded at the play-by-play level. While measures such as expected points and win probability are useful for evaluating football plays and game situations, there has been no research into how these values change throughout the course of a play. In this work, we make two main contributions: First, we introduce a general framework for continuous-time within-play valuation in the National Football League using player-tracking data. Our modular framework incorporates several modular sub-models, to easily incorporate recent work involving player tracking data in football. Second, we use a long short-term memory recurrent neural network to construct a ball-carrier model to estimate how many yards the ball-carrier is expected to gain from their current position, conditional on the locations and trajectories of the ball-carrier, their teammates and opponents. Additionally, we demonstrate an extension with conditional density estimation so that the expectation of any measure of play value can be calculated in continuous-time, which was never before possible at such a granular level.			arxiv	['Francesca Matano', 'Lee F.

In this context, we have observed that even the market for football data has substantially grown. The analysis of football matches relies on the annotation of both individual players' and team actions, as well as the athletic performance of players. Consequently, annotating football events at a fine-grained level is a very expensive and error-prone task. Most existing semi-automatic tools for football match annotation rely on cameras and computer vision. However, those tools fall short in capturing team dynamics, and in extracting data of players who are not visible in the camera frame. To address these issues, in this manuscript we present FootApp, an AI-based system for football match annotation. First, our system relies on an advanced and mixed user interface that exploits both vocal and touch interaction. Second, the motor performance of players is captured and processed by applying machine learning algorithms to data collected from inertial sensors worn by players. Artificial intelligence techniques are then used to check the consistency of generated labels, including those regarding the physical activity of players, to automatically recognize annotation errors. Notably, we implemented a full prototype of the proposed system, performing experiments to show its effectiveness in a real-world adoption scenario.			arxiv	['Salvatore M.

279	An Empirical Study on Google Research Football Multi-agent Scenarios	Yan Song	2023-05-16 14:18:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09458v1	Few multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) research on Google Research Football (GRF) focus on the 11v11 multi-agent full-game scenario and to the best of our knowledge, no open benchmark on this scenario has been released to the public. In this work, we fill the gap by providing a population-based MARL training pipeline and hyperparameter settings on multi-agent football scenario that outperforms the bot with difficulty 1.0 from scratch within 2 million steps. Our experiments serve as a reference for the expected performance of Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO), a state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm where each agent tries to maximize its own policy independently across various training configurations. Meanwhile, we open-source our training framework Light-MALib which extends the MALib codebase by distributed and asynchronized implementation with additional analytical tools for football games. Finally, we provide guidance for building strong football AI with population-based training and release diverse pretrained policies for benchmarking. The goal is to provide the community with a head start for whoever experiment their works on GRF and a simple-to-use population-based training framework for further improving their agents through self-play. The implementation is available at https://github.com/Shanghai-Digital-Brain-Laboratory/DB-Football.			arxiv	['He Jiang', 'Zheng Tian', 'Haifeng Zhang', 'Yingping Zhang', 'Jiangcheng Zhu', 'Zonghong Dai', 'Weinan Zhang', 'Jun Wang']	30.0

286	Fantasy Football Prediction	Roman Lutz	2015-05-26 12:14:56	http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06918v1	The ubiquity of professional sports and specifically the NFL have lead to an increase in popularity for Fantasy Football. Users have many tools at their disposal: statistics, predictions, rankings of experts and even recommendations of peers. There are issues with all of these, though. Especially since many people pay money to play, the prediction tools should be enhanced as they provide unbiased and easy-to-use assistance for users. This paper provides and discusses approaches to predict Fantasy Football scores of Quarterbacks with relatively limited data. In addition to that, it includes several suggestions on how the data could be enhanced to achieve better results. The dataset consists only of game data from the last six NFL seasons. I used two different methods to predict the Fantasy Football scores of NFL players: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Neural Networks. The results of both are promising given the limited data that was used.			arxiv	[]	37.0

We do so using only the thirty-year record of which visiting teams played which home teams, on what date, and what the final score was. No real ""statistics"" are used. The method works best in basketball, likely because it is high-scoring and has long seasons. It works better in football and hockey than in baseball, but in baseball the predictions are closer to a theoretical optimum. The football predictions, while good, can in principle be made much better, and the hockey predictions can be made somewhat better. These findings tells us that in basketball, most statistics are subsumed by the scores of the games, whereas in football, further study of game and player statistics is necessary to predict games as well as can be done. Baseball and hockey lie somewhere in between."			arxiv	[]	38.0
288	Identifying top football players and springboard clubs from a football player collaboration and club transfer networks	Matic Tribušon	2016-02-11 10:21:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03664v1	We consider all players and clubs in top twenty world football leagues in the last fifteen seasons. The purpose of this paper is to reveal top football players and identify springboard clubs. To do that, we construct two separate weighted networks. Player collaboration network consists of players, that are connected to each other if they ever played together at the same club. In directed club transfer network, clubs are connected if players were ever transferred from one club to another. To get meaningful results, we perform different network analysis methods on our networks. Our approach based on PageRank reveals Christiano Ronaldo as the top player. Using a variation of betweenness centrality, we identify Standard Liege as the best springboard club.			arxiv	['Matevž Lenič']	39.0
289	Rating evaluation of sports development efficiency using statistical analysis: evidence from Russian football	Ilya Solntsev	2016-12-22 11:02:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07543v1	Increasing investments into various dimensions of sports draw a significant amount of attention to the way these resources are being managed and which organizations achieve development goals with higher efficiency. This paper reviews the methodology of designing an efficiency rating model for assessing sports entities, focusing on the experience of Russian football. The Russian Regional Efficiency of Football Development model aims to evaluate the regional federations of the Football Union of Russian via 5 dimensions. The scoring method of the model is based on the three-sigma rule of distribution. Support factors in the form of population density and climate were also included, since Russian regions significantly differentiate in these aspects. The findings of this paper showcased that not a single region was able to achieve a maximum 5- star rating, while regions set to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup did not score better compared to others. In conclusion the authors provide various suggestions on further developing and implementing rating models within global sports organizations.			arxiv	['Anatoly Vorobyev', 'Elnura Irmatova', 'Nikita Osokin']	40.0

To examine this phenomenon, we assemble FOOTBALL, which contains 1,455 broadcast transcripts from American football games across six decades that are automatically annotated with 250K player mentions and linked with racial metadata. We identify major confounding factors for researchers examining racial bias in FOOTBALL, and perform a computational analysis that supports conclusions from prior social science studies.			arxiv	"['Luke Yeh', 'Abram Handler', 'Alvin Grissom II', '""Brendan OConnor""', 'Mohit Iyyer']"	41.0
291	Maximizing performance with an eye on the finances: a chance-constrained model for football transfer market decisions	Giovanni Pantuso	2019-11-10 08:31:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04689v2	Composing a team of professional players is among the most crucial decisions in association football. Nevertheless, transfer market decisions are often based on myopic objectives and are questionable from a financial point of view. This paper introduces a chance-constrained model to provide analytic support to club managers during transfer windows. The model seeks a top-performing team while adapting to different budgets and financial-risk profiles. In addition, it provides a new rating system that is able to numerically reflect the on-field performance of football players and thus contribute to an objective assessment of football players. The model and rating system are tested on a case study based on real market data. The data from the case study are available online for the benefit of future research.			arxiv	['Lars Magnus Hvattum']	42.0
292	Football tracking networks: Beyond event-based connectivity	J. M. Buldu	2020-11-11 19:04:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06014v1	We propose using Network Science as a complementary tool to analyze player and team behavior during a football match. Specifically, we introduce four kinds of networks based on different ways of interaction between players. Our approach's main novelty is to use tracking datasets to create football tracking networks, instead of constructing and analyzing the traditional networks based on events. In this way, we are able to capture player interactions that go beyond passes and introduce the concepts of (a) Ball Flow Networks, (b) Marking Networks, (c) Signed Proximity Networks and (d) Functional Coordination Networks. After defining the methodology for creating each kind of network, we show some examples using tracking datasets from four different matches of LaLiga Santander. Finally, we discuss some of the applications, limitations, and further improvements of football tracking networks.			arxiv	['D. Garrido', 'D. R. Antequera', 'J. Busquets', 'E. Estrada', 'R.

We first used random forest regression to select important variables predicting goal difference, which we used to calculate the Euclidian distances between teams. Creating a Laplacian eigenmap, we bisected the Fielder vector to identify the five major European football leagues' natural clusters. Our results showed how an unsupervised approach could successfully identify four clusters based on five basic performance metrics: shots, shots on target, shots conceded, possession, and pass success. The top two clusters identify those teams who dominate their respective leagues and are the best candidates to create the most competitive elite super league.			arxiv	['C. B. Beggs']	44.0

Which players should you draft for your team? We investigated this question using the wealth of data available from fantasy premier league football (soccer). Using the players' data from past seasons, for several seasons and several different budget constraints, we identified the highest scoring fantasy team for each season subject to each budget constraint. We then investigated quantifiable characteristics of these teams. Interestingly, across nearly every variable that is significant to the game of football and the budget, these top teams display diversity across these variables. Our results indicate that diversity is a general feature of top performing teams.			arxiv	['Jil Klünder', 'Julie Rowlett', 'Jonathan Stålberg']	45.0

For both growth and survival, it is crucial for recruiting departments to make smart choices when targeting players. Therefore, it is very important to identify the right parameters to monitor to predict market value. The following paper aims at determining the relevant features that successfully forecast future value for football players. Success is measured against their market value from TransferMarkt. To select prominent features, we use Lasso regressions and Random Forest algorithms. Some obvious variables are selected but we also observe some subtle dependencies between features and future market value. Finally, we rank the Golden Boy nominees using our forecasts and show our methodology can successfully compare football players based on their quality.			arxiv	['Elsa Bismuth', 'Aurèle Bohbot', 'Sébastien Coustou', 'Mathieu Lacome', 'Mathieu Rosenbaum']	46.0

Existing work has focused on tackling simplified scenarios of the game, or else leveraging expert demonstrations. In this paper, we develop a multi-agent system to play the full 11 vs. 11 game mode, without demonstrations. This game mode contains aspects that present major challenges to modern reinforcement learning algorithms; multi-agent coordination, long-term planning, and non-transitivity. To address these challenges, we present TiZero; a self-evolving, multi-agent system that learns from scratch. TiZero introduces several innovations, including adaptive curriculum learning, a novel self-play strategy, and an objective that optimizes the policies of multiple agents jointly. Experimentally, it outperforms previous systems by a large margin on the Google Research Football environment, increasing win rates by over 30%. To demonstrate the generality of TiZero's innovations, they are assessed on several environments beyond football; Overcooked, Multi-agent Particle-Environment, Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect-Four.			arxiv	['Shiyu Huang', 'Tim Pearce', 'Wenze Chen', 'Wei-Wei Tu']	47.0
297	Football fever: goal distributions and non-Gaussian statistics	Elmar Bittner	2006-06-01 16:42:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0606016v1	Analyzing football score data with statistical techniques, we investigate how the not purely random, but highly co-operative nature of the game is reflected in averaged properties such as the probability distributions of scored goals for the home and away teams. As it turns out, especially the tails of the distributions are not well described by the Poissonian or binomial model resulting from the assumption of uncorrelated random events. Instead, a good effective description of the data is provided by less basic distributions such as the negative binomial one or the probability densities of extreme value statistics. To understand this behavior from a microscopical point of view, however, no waiting time problem or extremal process need be invoked. Instead, modifying the Bernoulli random process underlying the Poissonian model to include a simple component of self-affirmation seems to describe the data surprisingly well and allows to understand the observed deviation from Gaussian statistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood as special cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score data from many leagues in Europe as well as from international tournaments, including data from all past tournaments of the ``FIFA World Cup'' series, and found the proposed models to be applicable rather universally. In particular, here we analyse the results of the German women's premier football league and consider the two separate German men's premier leagues in the East and West during the cold war times and the unified league after 1990 to see how scoring in football and the component of self-affirmation depend on cultural and political circumstances.			arxiv	['Andreas Nussbaumer', 'Wolfhard Janke', 'Martin Weigel']	48.0

A Statistical Analysis	Jiri Mazurek	2018-02-03 12:50:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00967v1	Many pundits and fans ask themselves the same question: Which football player bears most resemblance to Lionel Messi? Is it Chelsea's Eden Hazard? Is it Paulo Dybala, the heir to Messi in the national team of Argentina? Or is the most alike player to Messi someone completely else? In general, the research on the evaluation of players' performances originated in the context of baseball in the USA, but, currently, it is of great importance in almost every team sport on the planet. Specifically, football clubs' managers can use the data on player's similarity when looking for replacement of their players by other, presumably similar ones. Also, the research in the presented direction is certainly interesting both for football pundits and football fans. Therefore, the aim of this study is to answer the question from the title with the use of the statistical analysis based on the data from ongoing league season retrieved from WhoScored (WS) database. WS provides detailed data (up to 24 parameters such as goals scored, the number of assists, shots on goal, passes, dribbles or fouls) for players of TOP 5 European leagues, and ranks them with respect to their overall performance. For this study, 17 parameters (criteria) most relevant for an attacking player were used, and a set of 28 players, candidates to be 'most alike to Messi' from WS TOP 100 list were selected. After data normalization and application of a proper metric function the most similar player to Lionel Messi was found.			arxiv	[]	49.0
299	Football is becoming more predictable; Network analysis of 88 thousands matches in 11 major leagues	Victor Martins Maimone	2019-08-23 19:25:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08991v2	In recent years excessive monetization of football and professionalism among the players has been argued to have affected the quality of the match in different ways. On the one hand, playing football has become a high-income profession and the players are highly motivated; on the other hand, stronger teams have higher incomes and therefore afford better players leading to an even stronger appearance in tournaments that can make the game more imbalanced and hence predictable. To quantify and document this observation, in this work we take a minimalist network science approach to measure the predictability of football over 26 years in major European leagues. We show that over time, the games in major leagues have indeed become more predictable. We provide further support for this observation by showing that inequality between teams has increased and the home-field advantage has been vanishing ubiquitously. We do not include any direct analysis on the effects of monetization on football's predictability or therefore, lack of excitement, however, we propose several hypotheses which could be tested in future analyses.			arxiv	['Taha Yasseri']	50.0
300	Genre determining prediction: Non-standard TAM marking in football language	Jakob Egetenmeyer	2021-06-30 08:01:57	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15872v1	German and French football language display tense-aspect-mood (TAM) forms which differ from the TAM use in other genres. In German football talk, the present indicative may replace the pluperfect subjunctive. In French reports of football matches, the imperfective past may occur instead of a perfective past tense-aspect form. We argue that the two phenomena share a functional core and are licensed in the same way, which is a direct result of the genre they occur in. More precisely, football match reports adhere to a precise script and specific events are temporally determined in terms of objective time. This allows speakers to exploit a secondary function of TAM forms, namely, they shift the temporal perspective. We argue that it is on the grounds of the genre that comprehenders predict the deviating forms and are also able to decode them. We present various corpus studies where we explore the functioning of these phenomena in order to gain insights into their distribution, grammaticalization and their functioning in discourse. Relevant factors are Aktionsart properties, rhetorical relations and their interaction with other TAM forms. This allows us to discuss coping mechanisms on the part of the comprehender. We broaden our understanding of the phenomena, which have only been partly covered for French and up to now seem to have been ignored in German.			arxiv	[]	51.0
301	Automatic event detection in football using tracking data	Ferran Vidal-Codina	2022-02-01 23:20:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00804v3	One of the main shortcomings of event data in football, which has been extensively used for analytics in the recent years, is that it still requires manual collection, thus limiting its availability to a reduced number of tournaments. In this work, we propose a deterministic decision tree-based algorithm to automatically extract football events using tracking data, which consists of two steps: (1) a possession step that evaluates which player was in possession of the ball at each frame in the tracking data, as well as the distinct player configurations during the time intervals where the ball is not in play to inform set piece detection; (2) an event detection step that combines the changes in ball possession computed in the first step with the laws of football to determine in-game events and set pieces. The automatically generated events are benchmarked against manually annotated events and we show that in most event categories the proposed methodology achieves $+90\%$ detection rate across different tournaments and tracking data providers. Finally, we demonstrate how the contextual information offered by tracking data can be leveraged to increase the granularity of auto-detected events, and exhibit how the proposed framework may be used to conduct a myriad of data analyses in football.			arxiv	['Nicolas Evans', 'Bahaeddine El Fakir', 'Johsan Billingham']	52.0
302	Graph Neural Network based Agent in Google Research Football	Yizhan Niu	2022-04-23 21:26:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11142v1	Deep neural networks (DNN) can approximate value functions or policies for reinforcement learning, which makes the reinforcement learning algorithms more powerful. However, some DNNs, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), cannot extract enough information or take too long to obtain enough features from the inputs under specific circumstances of reinforcement learning. For example, the input data of Google Research Football, a reinforcement learning environment which trains agents to play football, is the small map of players' locations. The information is contained not only in the coordinates of players, but also in the relationships between different players. CNNs can neither extract enough information nor take too long to train. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep q-learning network (DQN) with a graph neural network (GNN) as its model. The GNN transforms the input data into a graph which better represents the football players' locations so that it extracts more information of the interactions between different players. With two GNNs to approximate its local and target value functions, this DQN allows players to learn from their experience by using value functions to see the prospective value of each intended action. The proposed model demonstrated the power of GNN in the football game by outperforming other DRL models with significantly fewer steps.			arxiv	['Jinglong Liu', 'Yuhao Shi', 'Jiren Zhu']	53.0
303	Automated player identification and indexing using two-stage deep learning network	Hongshan Liu	2022-04-26 02:59:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13809v2	American football games attract significant worldwide attention every year. Identifying players from videos in each play is also essential for the indexing of player participation. Processing football game video presents great challenges such as crowded settings, distorted objects, and imbalanced data for identifying players, especially jersey numbers. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based player tracking system to automatically track players and index their participation per play in American football games. It is a two-stage network design to highlight areas of interest and identify jersey number information with high accuracy. First, we utilize an object detection network, a detection transformer, to tackle the player detection problem in a crowded context. Second, we identify players using jersey number recognition with a secondary convolutional neural network, then synchronize it with a game clock subsystem. Finally, the system outputs a complete log in a database for play indexing. We demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of player tracking system by analyzing the qualitative and quantitative results on football videos. The proposed system shows great potential for implementation in and analysis of football broadcast video.			arxiv	['Colin Aderon', 'Noah Wagon', 'Abdul Latif Bamba', 'Xueshen Li', 'Huapu Liu', 'Steven MacCall', 'Yu Gan']	54.0
304	Explainable expected goal models for performance analysis in football analytics	Mustafa Cavus	2022-06-14 23:56:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07212v2	The expected goal provides a more representative measure of the team and player performance which also suit the low-scoring nature of football instead of score in modern football. The score of a match involves randomness and often may not represent the performance of the teams and players, therefore it has been popular to use the alternative statistics in recent years such as shots on target, ball possessions, and drills. To measure the probability of a shot being a goal by the expected goal, several features are used to train an expected goal model which is based on the event and tracking football data. The selection of these features, the size and date of the data, and the model which are used as the parameters that may affect the performance of the model. Using black-box machine learning models for increasing the predictive performance of the model decreases its interpretability that causes the loss of information that can be gathered from the model. This paper proposes an accurate expected goal model trained consisting of 315,430 shots from seven seasons between 2014-15 and 2020-21 of the top-five European football leagues. Moreover, this model is explained by using explainable artificial intelligence tool to obtain an explainable expected goal model for evaluating a team or player performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that demonstrates a practical application of an explainable artificial intelligence tool aggregated profiles to explain a group of observations on an accurate expected goal model for monitoring the team and player performance. Moreover, these methods can be generalized to other sports branches.			arxiv	['Przemysław Biecek']	55.0
305	Towards Active Learning for Action Spotting in Association Football Videos	Silvio Giancola	2023-04-09 11:50:41	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04220v1	Association football is a complex and dynamic sport, with numerous actions occurring simultaneously in each game. Analyzing football videos is challenging and requires identifying subtle and diverse spatio-temporal patterns. Despite recent advances in computer vision, current algorithms still face significant challenges when learning from limited annotated data, lowering their performance in detecting these patterns. In this paper, we propose an active learning framework that selects the most informative video samples to be annotated next, thus drastically reducing the annotation effort and accelerating the training of action spotting models to reach the highest accuracy at a faster pace. Our approach leverages the notion of uncertainty sampling to select the most challenging video clips to train on next, hastening the learning process of the algorithm. We demonstrate that our proposed active learning framework effectively reduces the required training data for accurate action spotting in football videos. We achieve similar performances for action spotting with NetVLAD++ on SoccerNet-v2, using only one-third of the dataset, indicating significant capabilities for reducing annotation time and improving data efficiency. We further validate our approach on two new datasets that focus on temporally localizing actions of headers and passes, proving its effectiveness across different action semantics in football. We believe our active learning framework for action spotting would support further applications of action spotting algorithms and accelerate annotation campaigns in the sports domain.			arxiv	['Anthony Cioppa', 'Julia Georgieva', 'Johsan Billingham', 'Andreas Serner', 'Kerry Peek', 'Bernard Ghanem', 'Marc Van Droogenbroeck']	56.0

However, the absence of standardized environment settings and unified evaluation metrics for multi-agent scenarios hampers the consistent understanding of various studies. Furthermore, the challenging 5-vs-5 and 11-vs-11 full-game scenarios have received limited thorough examination due to their substantial training complexities. To address these gaps, this paper extends the original environment by not only standardizing the environment settings and benchmarking cooperative learning algorithms across different scenarios, including the most challenging full-game scenarios, but also by discussing approaches to enhance football AI from diverse perspectives and introducing related research tools. Specifically, we provide a distributed and asynchronous population-based self-play framework with diverse pre-trained policies for faster training, two football-specific analytical tools for deeper investigation, and an online leaderboard for broader evaluation. The overall expectation of this work is to advance the study of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning on Google Research Football environment, with the ultimate goal of benefiting real-world sports beyond virtual games.			arxiv	['He Jiang', 'Haifeng Zhang', 'Zheng Tian', 'Weinan Zhang', 'Jun Wang']	57.0

Deshpande	2018-08-12 12:46:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03934v2	More than 1 million students play high school American football annually, but many health professionals have recently questioned its safety or called for its ban. These concerns have been partially driven by reports of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), increased risks of neurodegenerative disease, and associations between concussion history and later-life cognitive impairment and depression among retired professional football players. A recent observational study of a cohort of men who graduated from a Wisconsin high school in 1957 found no statistically significant harmful effects of playing high school football on a range of cognitive, psychological, and socio-economic outcomes measured at ages 35, 54, 65, and 72. Unfortunately, these findings may not generalize to younger populations, thanks to changes and improvements in football helmet technology and training techniques. In particular, these changes may have led to increased perceptions of safety but ultimately more dangerous styles of play, characterized by the frequent sub-concussive impacts thought to be associated with later-life neurological decline. In this work, we replicate the methodology of that earlier matched observational study using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). These include adolescent and family co-morbidities, academic experience, self-reported levels of general health and physical activity, and the score on the Add Health Picture Vocabulary Test. Our primary outcome is the CES-D score measured in 2008 when subjects were aged 24 -- 34 and settling into early adulthood. We also examine several secondary outcomes related to physical and psychological health, including suicidality. Our results can provide insight into the natural history of potential football-related decline and dysfunction.			arxiv	['Raiden B. Hasegawa', 'Jordan Weiss', 'Dylan S. Small']	58.0
308	Game Plan: What AI can do for Football, and What Football can do for AI	Karl Tuyls	2020-11-18 10:26:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09192v1	The rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has opened unprecedented analytics possibilities in various team and individual sports, including baseball, basketball, and tennis. More recently, AI techniques have been applied to football, due to a huge increase in data collection by professional teams, increased computational power, and advances in machine learning, with the goal of better addressing new scientific challenges involved in the analysis of both individual players' and coordinated teams' behaviors. The research challenges associated with predictive and prescriptive football analytics require new developments and progress at the intersection of statistical learning, game theory, and computer vision. In this paper, we provide an overarching perspective highlighting how the combination of these fields, in particular, forms a unique microcosm for AI research, while offering mutual benefits for professional teams, spectators, and broadcasters in the years to come. We illustrate that this duality makes football analytics a game changer of tremendous value, in terms of not only changing the game of football itself, but also in terms of what this domain can mean for the field of AI. We review the state-of-the-art and exemplify the types of analysis enabled by combining the aforementioned fields, including illustrative examples of counterfactual analysis using predictive models, and the combination of game-theoretic analysis of penalty kicks with statistical learning of player attributes. We conclude by highlighting envisioned downstream impacts, including possibilities for extensions to other sports (real and virtual).			arxiv	['Shayegan Omidshafiei', 'Paul Muller', 'Zhe Wang', 'Jerome Connor', 'Daniel Hennes', 'Ian Graham', 'William Spearman', 'Tim Waskett', 'Dafydd Steele', 'Pauline Luc', 'Adria Recasens', 'Alexandre Galashov', 'Gregory Thornton', 'Romuald Elie', 'Pablo Sprechmann', 'Pol Moreno', 'Kris Cao', 'Marta Garnelo', 'Praneet Dutta', 'Michal Valko', 'Nicolas Heess', 'Alex Bridgland', 'Julien Perolat', 'Bart De Vylder', 'Ali Eslami', 'Mark Rowland', 'Andrew Jaegle', 'Remi Munos', 'Trevor Back', 'Razia Ahamed', 'Simon Bouton', 'Nathalie Beauguerlange', 'Jackson Broshear', 'Thore Graepel', 'Demis Hassabis']	59.0
309	Deep Artificial Intelligence for Fantasy Football Language Understanding	Aaron Baughman	2021-11-04 14:02:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02874v1	Fantasy sports allow fans to manage a team of their favorite athletes and compete with friends. The fantasy platform aligns the real-world statistical performance of athletes to fantasy scoring and has steadily risen in popularity to an estimated 9.1 million players per month with 4.4 billion player card views on the ESPN Fantasy Football platform from 2018-2019. In parallel, the sports media community produces news stories, blogs, forum posts, tweets, videos, podcasts and opinion pieces that are both within and outside the context of fantasy sports. However, human fantasy football players can only analyze an average of 3.9 sources of information. Our work discusses the results of a machine learning pipeline to manage an ESPN Fantasy Football team. The use of trained statistical entity detectors and document2vector models applied to over 100,000 news sources and 2.3 million articles, videos and podcasts each day enables the system to comprehend natural language with an analogy test accuracy of 100% and keyword test accuracy of 80%. Deep learning feedforward neural networks provide player classifications such as if a player will be a bust, boom, play with a hidden injury or play meaningful touches with a cumulative 72% accuracy. Finally, a multiple regression ensemble uses the deep learning output and ESPN projection data to provide a point projection for each of the top 500+ fantasy football players in 2018. The point projection maintained a RMSE of 6.78 points. The best fit probability density function from a set of 24 is selected to visualize score spreads. Within the first 6 weeks of the product launch, the total number of users spent a cumulative time of over 4.6 years viewing our AI insights. The training data for our models was provided by a 2015 to 2016 web archive from Webhose, ESPN statistics, and Rotowire injury reports. We used 2017 fantasy football data as a test set.			arxiv	['Micah Forester', 'Jeff Powell', 'Eduardo Morales', 'Shaun McPartlin', 'Daniel Bohm']	60.0
310	A Machine Learning Approach for Player and Position Adjusted Expected Goals in Football (Soccer)	James H. Hewitt	2023-01-19 22:17:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13052v2	Football is a very result-driven industry, with goals being rarer than in most sports, so having further parameters to judge the performance of teams and individuals is key. Expected Goals (xG) allow further insight than just a scoreline. To tackle the need for further analysis in football, this paper uses machine learning applications that are developed and applied to Football Event data. From the concept, a Binary Classification problem is created whereby a probabilistic valuation is outputted using Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting based approaches. The model successfully predicts xGs probability values for football players based on 15,575 shots. The proposed solution utilises StatsBomb as the data provider and an industry benchmark to tune the models in the right direction. The proposed ML solution for xG is further used to tackle the age-old cliche of: 'the ball has fallen to the wrong guy there'. The development of the model is used to adjust and gain more realistic values of expected goals than the general models show. To achieve this, this paper tackles Positional Adjusted xG, splitting the training data into Forward, Midfield, and Defence with the aim of providing insight into player qualities based on their positional sub-group. Positional Adjusted xG successfully predicts and proves that more attacking players are better at accumulating xG. The highest value belonged to Forwards followed by Midfielders and Defenders. Finally, this study has further developments into Player Adjusted xG with the aim of proving that Messi is statistically at a higher efficiency level than the average footballer. This is achieved by using Messi subset samples to quantify his qualities in comparison to the average xG models finding that Messi xG performs 347 xG higher than the general model outcome.			arxiv	['Oktay Karakuş']	61.0

Mira	2006-07-20 18:19:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0607183v1	The effect of increasing goal mouth size on the number of goals scored in a football match is discussed in a very preliminary and simple way, considering elastic collisions of the ball with the posts. The result is obtained on the basis of data taken from the Spanish Professional League, that show a high number of shots-to-post. Surprisingly, there is a direct correlation of the increase in goal mouth area with the increase of goals.			arxiv	[]	63.0

We find that the networks have the small-world property, and their degree distributions are fitted well by a truncated gamma distribution function. In order to reproduce these properties of networks, a model based on a Markov chain is proposed.			arxiv	['Ken Yamamoto', 'Yoshihiro Yamazaki']	64.0
314	The Sensitivity of College Football Rankings to Several Modeling Choices	Andrew T. Karl	2014-03-29 15:54:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.7642v1	This paper proposes a multiple-membership generalized linear mixed model for ranking college football teams using only their win/loss records. The model results in an intractable, high-dimensional integral due to the random effects structure and nonlinear link function. We use recent data sets to explore the effect of the choice of integral approximation and other modeling assumptions on the rankings. Varying the modeling assumptions sometimes leads to changes in the team rankings that could affect bowl assignments.			arxiv	[]	65.0
315	A Markovian model for association football possession and its outcomes	Javier López Peña	2014-03-31 13:45:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.7993v1	We propose a bottom-up approach to the study of possession and its outcomes for association football, based on probabilistic finite state automata with transition probabilities described by a Markov process. We show how even a very simple model yields faithful approximations to the distribution of passing sequences and chances of taking shots for English Premier League teams, which we fit using a whole season of granular game data (380 games). We compare the resulting model with classical top-down distributions traditionally used to describe possessions, showing that the Markov models yield a more accurate asymptotic behaviour.			arxiv	[]	66.0

In this network, a player on a certain area in the divided fields is a node, and a pass between two nodes corresponds to an edge. Our model is characterized by the consecutive choice of a node dependent on its intrinsic fitness. We derive the explicit expression of the degree distribution, and find that the derived distribution reproduces the real data quit well.			arxiv	['Ken Yamamoto', 'Yoshihiro Yamazaki']	67.0

Although the majority of the on-the-ball actions during games constitutes of passes, many of the currently available metrics focus on measuring the quality of shots only. To help bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach to measure players' on-the-ball contributions from passes during games. Our proposed approach measures the expected impact of each pass on the scoreline.			arxiv	['Jan Van Haaren']	70.0

322	On convergence to a football	Hao Fang	2015-01-27 19:44:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06881v2	We show that spheres of positive constant curvature with $n$ ($n\geq3$) conic points converge to a sphere of positive constant curvature with two conic points (or called an (American) football) in Gromov-Hausdorff topology when the corresponding singular divisors converge to a critical divisor in the sense of Troyanov. We prove this convergence in two different ways. Geometrically, the convergence follows from Luo-Tian's explicit description of conic spheres as boundaries of convex polytopes in $S^{3}$. Analytically, regarding the conformal factors as the singular solutions to the corresponding PDE, we derive the required a priori estimates and convergence result after proper reparametrization.			arxiv	['Mijia Lai']	73.0

Our method first clusters formations into several average formations: `442,' `4141,' `433,' `541,' and `343.' Then, each average formation is further divided into more specific patterns in which the configurations of players are slightly different. The latter step is based on hierarchical clustering and the Delaunay method, which defines the formation of a team as an adjacency matrix of Delaunay triangulation. A formation clustered using our method is expressed in a form such as `442-C1'.			arxiv	['Yoshihiro Yamazaki']	74.0

For that purpose, we model minute-by-minute in-game statistics of Bundesliga matches using hidden Markov models (HMMs). To allow for within-state correlation of the variables considered, we formulate multivariate state-dependent distributions using copulas. For the Bundesliga data considered, we find that the fitted HMMs comprise states which can be interpreted as a team showing different levels of control over a match. Our modelling framework enables inference related to causes of momentum shifts and team tactics, which is of much interest to managers, bookmakers, and sports fans."			arxiv	['Roland Langrock', 'Antonello Maruotti']	76.0

Our data consists of roughly 50,000 penalties from the eleven~most recent seasons in European men's football competitions. About one third of the penalties are from more than 1,500 penalty shootouts. We find that shootout conversion rates are significantly lower, and attribute this to worse performance of shooters rather than better performance of goalkeepers. We also find that, statistically, there is no advantage for either team in the usual alternating shooting order. These main findings are complemented by a number of more detailed analyses.			arxiv	['David Schoch', 'Ulrik Brandes']	83.0

To help bridge this gap, we present a method that can estimate continuous full-pitch tracking data from discrete data made from broadcast footage. Such data could be collected by clubs or players at a similar cost to event data, which is widely available down to semi-professional level.

334	Space evaluation in football games via field weighting based on tracking data	Takuma Narizuka	2020-01-31 02:05:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11629v2	In football game analysis, space evaluation is an important issue because it is directly related to the quality of ball passing or player formations. Previous studies have primarily focused on a field division approach wherein a field is divided into dominant regions in which a certain player can arrive prior to any other players. However, the field division approach is oversimplified because all locations within a region are regarded as uniform herein. The objective of the current study is to propose a fundamental framework for space evaluation based on field weighting. In particular, we employed the motion model and calculated a minimum arrival time $ \tau $ for each player to all locations on the football field. Our main contribution is that two variables $ \tau_{\textrm{of}} $ and $ \tau_{\textrm{df}} $ corresponding to the minimum arrival time for offense and defense teams are considered; using $ \tau_{\textrm{of}} $ and $ \tau_{\textrm{df}} $, new orthogonal variables $ z_{1} $ and $ z_{2} $ are defined. In particular, based on real datasets comprising of data from 45 football games of the J1 League in 2018, we provide a detailed characterization of $ z_{1} $ and $ z_{2} $ in terms of ball passing. By using our method, we found that $ z_{1}(\vec{x}, t) $ and $ z_{2}(\vec{x}, t) $ represent the degree of safety for a pass made to $ \vec{x} $ at $ t $ and degree of sparsity of $ \vec{x} $ at $ t $, respectively; the success probability of passes could be well-fitted using a sigmoid function. Moreover, a new type of field division approach and evaluation of ball passing just before shoots using real game data are discussed.			arxiv	['Yoshihiro Yamazaki', 'Kenta Takizawa']	85.0
335	Defining a historic football team: Using Network Science to analyze Guardiola's F.C. Barcelona	J. M. Buldu	2019-09-19 10:14:50	http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08903v1	The application of Network Science to social systems has introduced new methodologies to analyze classical problems such as the emergence of epidemics, the arousal of cooperation between individuals or the propagation of information along social networks. More recently, the organization of football teams and their performance have been unveiled using metrics coming from Network Science, where a team is considered as a complex network whose nodes (i.e., players) interact with the aim of overcoming the opponent network. Here, we combine the use of different network metrics to extract the particular signature of the F.C. Barcelona coached by Guardiola, which has been considered one of the best teams along football history. We have first compared the network organization of Guardiola's team with their opponents along one season of the Spanish national league, identifying those metrics with statistically significant differences and relating them with the Guardiola's game. Next, we have focused on the temporal nature of football passing networks and calculated the evolution of all network properties along a match, instead of considering their average. In this way, we are able to identify those network metrics that enhance the probability of scoring/receiving a goal, showing that not all teams behave in the same way and how the organization Guardiola's F.C. Barcelona is different from the rest, including its clustering coefficient, shortest-path length, largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix, algebraic connectivity and centrality distribution.			arxiv	['J.

336	Bigger data, better questions, and a return to fourth down behavior: an introduction to a special issue on tracking data in the National football League	Michael J. Lopez	2019-09-23 21:47:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10631v3	Most historical National Football League (NFL) analysis, both mainstream and academic, has relied on public, play-level data to generate team and player comparisons. Given the number of oft omitted variables that impact on-field results, such as play call, game situation, and opponent strength, findings tend to be more anecdotal than actionable. With the release of player tracking data, however, analysts can better ask and answer questions to isolate skill and strategy. In this article, we highlight the limitations of traditional analyses, and use a decades-old punching bag for analysts, fourth-down strategy, as a microcosm for why tracking data is needed. Specifically, we assert that, in absence of using the precise yardage needed for a first down, past findings supporting an aggressive fourth down strategy may have been overstated. Next, we synthesize recent work that comprises this special Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports issue into player tracking data in football. Finally, we conclude with some best practices and limitations regarding usage of this data. The release of player tracking data marks a transition for the league and its' analysts, and we hope this issue helps guide innovation in football analytics for years to come.			arxiv	[]	87.0
337	TiKick: Towards Playing Multi-agent Football Full Games from Single-agent Demonstrations	Shiyu Huang	2021-10-09 08:34:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04507v5	Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved super-human performance on complex video games (e.g., StarCraft II and Dota II). However, current DRL systems still suffer from challenges of multi-agent coordination, sparse rewards, stochastic environments, etc. In seeking to address these challenges, we employ a football video game, e.g., Google Research Football (GRF), as our testbed and develop an end-to-end learning-based AI system (denoted as TiKick) to complete this challenging task. In this work, we first generated a large replay dataset from the self-playing of single-agent experts, which are obtained from league training. We then developed a distributed learning system and new offline algorithms to learn a powerful multi-agent AI from the fixed single-agent dataset. To the best of our knowledge, Tikick is the first learning-based AI system that can take over the multi-agent Google Research Football full game, while previous work could either control a single agent or experiment on toy academic scenarios. Extensive experiments further show that our pre-trained model can accelerate the training process of the modern multi-agent algorithm and our method achieves state-of-the-art performances on various academic scenarios.			arxiv	['Wenze Chen', 'Longfei Zhang', 'Shizhen Xu', 'Ziyang Li', 'Fengming Zhu', 'Deheng Ye', 'Ting Chen', 'Jun Zhu']	88.0
338	A Validation Procedure for the Estimation of Reachable Regions in Football	M. Renkin	2022-04-07 08:34:19	http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13992v1	Modelling the trajectorial motion of humans along the ground is a foundational task in the quantitative analysis of sports like association football. Most existing models of football player motion have not been validated yet with respect to actual data. One of the reasons for this lack is that performing such a validation is not straightforward, because models of player motion are usually phrased in a way that emphasises possibly reachable positions rather than expected positions. Since positional data of football players typically contains outliers, this data may misrepresent the range of actually reachable positions. This paper proposes a validation routine for trajectorial motion models that measures and optimises the ability of a motion model to accurately predict all possibly reachable positions by favoring the smallest predicted area of reachable positions that encompasses all observed reached positions up to a manually defined threshold. We demonstrate validation and optimisation on four different motion models, assuming (a) motion with constant speed, (b) motion with constant acceleration, (c) motion with constant acceleration with a speed limit, and (d) motion along two segments with constant speed. Our results show that assuming motion with constant speed or constant acceleration without a limit on the achievable speed is particularly inappropriate for an accurate distinction between reachable and unreachable locations. Motion along two segments of constant speed provides by far the highest accuracy among the tested models and serves as an efficient and accurate approximation of real-world player motion.			arxiv	['J.

339	Characterizing player's playing styles based on Player Vectors for each playing position in the Chinese Football Super League	Yuesen Li	2022-05-05 16:05:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02731v2	Characterizing playing style is important for football clubs on scouting, monitoring and match preparation. Previous studies considered a player's style as a combination of technical performances, failing to consider the spatial information. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the playing styles of each playing position in the Chinese Football Super League (CSL) matches, integrating a recently adopted Player Vectors framework. Data of 960 matches from 2016-2019 CSL were used. Match ratings, and ten types of match events with the corresponding coordinates for all the lineup players whose on-pitch time exceeded 45 minutes were extracted. Players were first clustered into 8 positions. A player vector was constructed for each player in each match based on the Player Vectors using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Another NMF process was run on the player vectors to extract different types of playing styles. The resulting player vectors discovered 18 different playing styles in the CSL. Six performance indicators of each style were investigated to observe their contributions. In general, the playing styles of forwards and midfielders are in line with football performance evolution trends, while the styles of defenders should be reconsidered. Multifunctional playing styles were also found in high rated CSL players.			arxiv	['Shouxin Zong', 'Yanfei Shen', 'Zhiqiang Pu', 'Miguel-Ángel Gómez', 'Yixiong Cui']	90.0
340	Identifying and Extracting Football Features from Real-World Media Sources using Only Synthetic Training Data	Jose Cerqueira Fernandes	2022-09-27 08:48:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13254v1	Real-world images used for training machine learning algorithms are often unstructured and inconsistent. The process of analysing and tagging these images can be costly and error prone (also availability, gaps and legal conundrums). However, as we demonstrate in this article, the potential to generate accurate graphical images that are indistinguishable from real-world sources has a multitude of benefits in machine learning paradigms. One such example of this is football data from broadcast services (television and other streaming media sources). The football games are usually recorded from multiple sources (cameras and phones) and resolutions, not to mention, occlusion of visual details and other artefacts (like blurring, weathering and lighting conditions) which make it difficult to accurately identify features. We demonstrate an approach which is able to overcome these limitations using generated tagged and structured images. The generated images are able to simulate a variety views and conditions (including noise and blurring) which may only occur sporadically in real-world data and make it difficult for machine learning algorithm to 'cope' with these unforeseen problems in real-data. This approach enables us to rapidly train and prepare a robust solution that accurately extracts features (e.g., spacial locations, markers on the pitch, player positions, ball location and camera FOV) from real-world football match sources for analytical purposes.			arxiv	['Benjamin Kenwright']	91.0
341	Betting the system: Using lineups to predict football scores	George Peters	2022-10-12 15:47:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06327v3	This paper aims to reduce randomness in football by analysing the role of lineups in final scores using machine learning prediction models we have developed. Football clubs invest millions of dollars on lineups and knowing how individual statistics translate to better outcomes can optimise investments. Moreover, sports betting is growing exponentially and being able to predict the future is profitable and desirable. We use machine learning models and historical player data from English Premier League (2020-2022) to predict scores and to understand how individual performance can improve the outcome of a match. We compared different prediction techniques to maximise the possibility of finding useful models. We created heuristic and machine learning models predicting football scores to compare different techniques. We used different sets of features and shown goalkeepers stats are more important than attackers stats to predict goals scored. We applied a broad evaluation process to assess the efficacy of the models in real world applications. We managed to predict correctly all relegated teams after forecast 100 consecutive matches. We show that Support Vector Regression outperformed other techniques predicting final scores and that lineups do not improve predictions. Finally, our model was profitable (42% return) when emulating a betting system using real world odds data.			arxiv	['Diogo Pacheco']	92.0
342	Partially Constrained Group Variable Selection to Adjust for Complementary Unit Performance in American College Football	Andrey Skripnikov	2022-10-22 18:38:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12519v1	Given the importance of accurate team rankings in American college football (CFB) -- due to heavy title and playoff implications -- strides have been made to improve evaluation metrics across statistical categories, going from basic averages (e.g. points scored per game) to metrics that adjust for a team's strength of schedule, but one aspect that hasn't been emphasized is the complementary nature of American football. Despite the same team's offensive and defensive units typically consisting of separate player sets, some aspects of your team's defensive (offensive) performance may affect the complementary side: turnovers forced by your defense could lead to easier scoring chances for your offense, while your offense's ability to control the clock may help your defense. For 2009-2019 CFB seasons, we incorporate natural splines with group penalty approaches to identify the most consistently influential features of complementary football in a data-driven way, conducting partially constrained optimization in order to additionally guarantee the full adjustment for strength of schedule and homefield factor. We touch on the issues arising due to reverse-causal nature of certain within-game dynamics, discussing several potential remedies. Lastly, game outcome prediction performances are compared across several ranking adjustment approaches for method validation purposes.			arxiv	[]	93.0
343	Design and Implementation of A Soccer Ball Detection System with Multiple Cameras	Lei Li	2023-01-31 22:04:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00123v1	The detection of small and medium-sized objects in three dimensions has always been a frontier exploration problem. This technology has a very wide application in sports analysis, games, virtual reality, human animation and other fields. The traditional three-dimensional small target detection technology has the disadvantages of high cost, low precision and inconvenience, so it is difficult to apply in practice. With the development of machine learning and deep learning, the technology of computer vision algorithms is becoming more mature. Creating an immersive media experience is considered to be a very important research work in sports. The main work is to explore and solve the problem of football detection under the multiple cameras, aiming at the research and implementation of the live broadcast system of football matches. Using multi cameras detects a target ball and determines its position in three dimension with the occlusion, motion, low illumination of the target object. This paper designed and implemented football detection system under multiple cameras for the detection and capture of targets in real-time matches. The main work mainly consists of three parts, football detector, single camera detection, and multi-cameras detection. The system used bundle adjustment to obtain the three-dimensional position of the target, and the GPU to accelerates data pre-processing and achieve accurate real-time capture of the target. By testing the system, it shows that the system can accurately detect and capture the moving targets in 3D. In addition, the solution in this paper is reusable for large-scale competitions, like basketball and soccer. The system framework can be well transplanted into other similar engineering project systems. It has been put into the market.			arxiv	['Tianfang Zhang', 'Zhongfeng Kang', 'Wenhan Zhang']	94.0
344	Impact of velocity and impact angle on football shot accuracy during fundamental trainings	Rahman Sahinler	2023-02-07 12:24:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03426v1	The purpose of this research is to create a machine learning-based smart coaching approach for football that can replace manual analysis with real-time feedback for trainers. In-depth analysis of football player data by humans is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires a lot of effort. This exploratory study demonstrates the feasibility of using a machine learning algorithm to enhance the effectiveness of player monitoring and training. The suggested approach uses machine learning to generate analytical insights and enable long-term monitoring of player performance. In the future, machine learning could use this technique to offer constructive criticism of football players. The system incorporates a homemade ball-throwing mechanism capable of launching the ball in a variety of directions and at varying velocities. The ball kicker is equipped with a gyroscope and accelerometer sensors for measuring velocity and acceleration. The gathered data is filtered initially, and then the data that has been processed is fed into the machine-learning algorithm. The algorithm will be trained on player performance data and will be able to provide real-time feedback to coaches on player performance and potential areas for improvement. Additionally, the system will be able to track player progress over time and provide coaches with a comprehensive view of player development. The ultimate goal is to improve player performance and reduce the workload for coaches by automating the analysis process.			arxiv	['Omer Burak Goktas', 'Berkay Mumcu', 'Damla Sen', 'Feyza Kocaturk', 'Huseyin Uvet']	95.0
345	Deep Generative Multi-Agent Imitation Model as a Computational Benchmark for Evaluating Human Performance in Complex Interactive Tasks: A Case Study in Football	Chaoyi Gu	2023-03-23 15:01:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13323v1	Evaluating the performance of human is a common need across many applications, such as in engineering and sports. When evaluating human performance in completing complex and interactive tasks, the most common way is to use a metric having been proved efficient for that context, or to use subjective measurement techniques. However, this can be an error prone and unreliable process since static metrics cannot capture all the complex contexts associated with such tasks and biases exist in subjective measurement. The objective of our research is to create data-driven AI agents as computational benchmarks to evaluate human performance in solving difficult tasks involving multiple humans and contextual factors. We demonstrate this within the context of football performance analysis. We train a generative model based on Conditional Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) Model on a large player and ball tracking dataset. The trained model is used to imitate the interactions between two teams and predict the performance from each team. Then the trained Conditional VRNN Model is used as a benchmark to evaluate team performance. The experimental results on Premier League football dataset demonstrates the usefulness of our method to existing state-of-the-art static metric used in football analytics.			arxiv	['Varuna De Silva']	96.0
346	Here Comes the STRAIN: Analyzing Defensive Pass Rush in American Football with Player Tracking Data	Quang Nguyen	2023-05-17 14:52:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10262v3	In American football, a pass rush is an attempt by the defensive team to disrupt the offense and prevent the quarterback (QB) from completing a pass. Existing metrics for assessing pass rush performance are either discrete-time quantities or based on subjective judgment. Using player tracking data, we propose STRAIN, a novel metric for evaluating pass rushers in the National Football League (NFL) at the continuous-time within-play level. Inspired by the concept of strain rate in materials science, STRAIN is a simple and interpretable means for measuring defensive pressure in football. It is a directly-observed statistic as a function of two features: the distance between the pass rusher and QB, and the rate at which this distance is being reduced. Our metric possesses great predictability of pressure and stability over time. We also fit a multilevel model for STRAIN to understand the defensive pressure contribution of every pass rusher at the play-level. We apply our approach to NFL data and present results for the first eight weeks of the 2021 regular season. In particular, we provide comparisons of STRAIN for different defensive positions and play outcomes, and rankings of the NFL's best pass rushers according to our metric.			arxiv	['Ronald Yurko', 'Gregory J.

347	A network-based ranking system for American college football	Juyong Park	2005-05-24 17:07:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505169v4	American college football faces a conflict created by the desire to stage national championship games between the best teams of a season when there is no conventional playoff system to decide which those teams are. Instead, ranking of teams is based on their record of wins and losses during the season, but each team plays only a small fraction of eligible opponents, making the system underdetermined or contradictory or both. It is an interesting challenge to create a ranking system that at once is mathematically well-founded, gives results in general accord with received wisdom concerning the relative strengths of the teams, and is based upon intuitive principles, allowing it to be accepted readily by fans and experts alike. Here we introduce a one-parameter ranking method that satisfies all of these requirements and is based on a network representation of college football schedules.			arxiv	['M. E. J. Newman']	98.0

It turns out that in particular the tails of the distributions are not well described by independent Bernoulli trials, but rather well modeled by negative binomial or generalized extreme value distributions. To understand this behavior from first principles, we suggest to modify the Bernoulli random process to include a simple component of self-affirmation which seems to describe the data surprisingly well and allows to interpret the observed deviation from Gaussian statistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood as special cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score data from many leagues in Europe as well as from international tournaments and found the proposed models to be applicable rather universally. In particular, here we compare men's and women's leagues and the separate German leagues during the cold war times and find some remarkable differences.			arxiv	['Andreas Nussbaumer', 'Wolfhard Janke', 'Martin Weigel']	99.0

Moss	2012-04-12 15:18:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2753v1	We use computational simulations to compare the impact response of different football and U.S. Army helmet pad materials. We conduct experiments to characterize the material response of different helmet pads. We simulate experimental helmet impact tests performed by the U.S. Army to validate our methods. We then simulate a cylindrical impactor striking different pads. The acceleration history of the impactor is used to calculate the Head Injury Criterion for each pad. We conduct sensitivity studies exploring the effects of pad composition, geometry, and material stiffness. We find that: (1) The football pad materials do not outperform the currently used military pad material in militarily-relevant impact scenarios; (2) Optimal material properties for a pad depend on impact energy; and (3) Thicker pads perform better at all velocities. Our analysis suggests that by using larger helmet shells with correspondingly thicker pads, impact-induced traumatic brain injury may be significantly reduced.

The algorithm starts with an initial population including three different groups of teams: the wealthiest (strongest), the regular, the poorest (weakest). Each individual of population constitute a football team while each player is an indication of a player in a post. The optimization can hopefully occurs when the competition among the teams in all the leagues is imitated as the strongest teams usually purchase the best players of the regular teams and in turn, regular teams purchase the best players of the weakest who should always discover young players instead of buying professionals. It has been shown that the algorithm can hopefully converge to an acceptable solution solving various benchmarks. Key words: Heuristic Algorithms			arxiv	[]	101.0

In this paper we analyse the available data on football world championships since 1930 until today. Our goal is to rank the national teams based on all matches during the championships. For this purpose, we apply the PageRank with restarts algorithm to a graph built from the games played during the tournaments. Several statistics such as matches won and goals scored are combined in different metrics that assign weights to the links in the graph. Finally, our results indicate that the Random walk approach with the use of right metrics can indeed produce relevant rankings comparable to the FIFA official all-time ranking board.			arxiv	['Lasko Basnarkov']	102.0
352	MORE: Merged Opinions Reputation Model	Nardine Osman	2015-03-31 14:39:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.09066v1	Reputation is generally defined as the opinion of a group on an aspect of a thing. This paper presents a reputation model that follows a probabilistic modelling of opinions based on three main concepts: (1) the value of an opinion decays with time, (2) the reputation of the opinion source impacts the reliability of the opinion, and (3) the certainty of the opinion impacts its weight with respect to other opinions. Furthermore, the model is flexible with its opinion sources: it may use explicit opinions or implicit opinions that can be extracted from agent behavior in domains where explicit opinions are sparse. We illustrate the latter with an approach to extract opinions from behavioral information in the sports domain, focusing on football in particular. One of the uses of a reputation model is predicting behavior. We take up the challenge of predicting the behavior of football teams in football matches, which we argue is a very interesting yet difficult approach for evaluating the model.			arxiv	['Alessandro Provetti', 'Valerio Riggi', 'Carles Sierra']	103.0

A passing motif analysis of football players	Javier López Peña	2015-06-23 16:25:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07768v1	"Traditionally, most of football statistical and media coverage has been focused almost exclusively on goals and (ocassionally) shots. However, most of the duration of a football game is spent away from the boxes, passing the ball around. The way teams pass the ball around is the most characteristic measurement of what a team's ""unique style"" is. In the present work we analyse passing sequences at the player level, using the different passing frequencies as a ""digital fingerprint"" of a player's style. The resulting numbers provide an adequate feature set which can be used in order to construct a measure of similarity between players. Armed with such a similarity tool, one can try to answer the question: Who might possibly replace Xavi at FC Barcelona?"			arxiv	['Raúl Sánchez Navarro']	104.0

However, the quantification of competitive balance is not an easy task. The difficulties are mainly associated with its multi-dimensionality character as well as the structure of each particular sport. This article uses data from eight domestic leagues over 60 years to identify the best index for a holistic view of competitive balance in European football. The findings support the longstanding Uncertainty of Outcome Hypothesis using indices designed for the important three identified levels of competition and offering a weighting pattern for ranking places. Important conclusions may be derived concerning the relative importance of different aspects of competitive balance depending on the specific features of the best index.			arxiv	['Ioannis Ntzoufras', 'James Reade']	105.0

The proposed method is fully automatic in contrast to the current state of the art which requires manual initialization of point correspondences between the image and the static model. Automatic registration using existing approaches has been difficult due to the lack of sufficient point correspondences. We investigate an alternate approach exploiting the edge information from the line markings on the field. We formulate the registration problem as a nearest neighbour search over a synthetically generated dictionary of edge map and homography pairs. The synthetic dictionary generation allows us to exhaustively cover a wide variety of camera angles and positions and reduce this problem to a minimal per-frame edge map matching procedure. We show that the per-frame results can be improved in videos using an optimization framework for temporal camera stabilization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting extensive results on a dataset collected from matches of football World Cup 2014.			arxiv	['Bharath Bhat', 'Vineet Gandhi', 'C. V.

The method is implemented in the R add-on package GJRM and allows for modelling linear and non-linear dependence through the use of several copulae. Moreover, the parameters of the marginal distributions of the count responses and of the copula can be specified as flexible functions of covariates. Motivated by a football application, we also discuss an extension which forces the regression coefficients of the marginal (linear) predictors to be equal via a suitable penalisation. Model fitting is based on a trust region algorithm which estimates simultaneously all the parameters of the joint models. We investigate the proposal's empirical performance in two simulation studies, the first one designed for arbitrary count data, the other one reflecting football-specific settings. Finally, the method is applied to FIFA World Cup data, showing its competitiveness to the standard approach with regard to predictive performance.			arxiv	['Andreas Groll', 'Thomas Kneib', 'Giampiero Marra', 'Rosalba Radice']	109.0

Building upon this, we develop algorithms to optimise team formation and in-game tactics with different objectives. Empirical evaluation of our approach on real-world datasets from 760 matches shows that by using optimised tactics from our Bayesian and stochastic games, we can increase a team chances of winning by up to 16.1\% and 3.4\% respectively.			arxiv	['Georgios Chalkiadakis', 'Timothy J.

Specifically, we are concerned about the re-start of the Spanish national football league, La Liga, which is currently -May 2020- stopped with 11 fixtures remaining. Our model includes two additional states of an individual, confined and quarantined, which are reached when an individual presents COVID-19 symptoms or has undergone a virus test with a positive result. The model also accounts for the interaction dynamics of players, considering three different sources of infection: the player social circle, the contact with his/her team colleagues during training sessions, and the interaction with rivals during a match. Our results highlight the influence of the days between matches, the frequency of virus tests and their sensitivity on the number of players infected at the end of the season. Following our findings, we finally present a variety of strategies to minimize the probability that COVID-19 propagates in case the season of La Liga was re-started after the current lockdown.			arxiv	['Daniel R.

However, existing orientation estimation methods, which are based on computer-vision techniques, still have a lot of room for improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this article presents the first deep learning model for estimating orientation directly from video footage. By approaching this challenge as a classification problem where classes correspond to orientation bins, and by introducing a cyclic loss function, a well-known convolutional network is refined to provide player orientation data. The model is trained by using ground-truth orientation data obtained from wearable EPTS devices, which are individually compensated with respect to the perceived orientation in the current frame. The obtained results outperform previous methods; in particular, the absolute median error is less than 12 degrees per player. An ablation study is included in order to show the potential generalization to any kind of football video footage.			arxiv	['Adrián Martín', 'Paulino Granero', 'Coloma Ballester', 'Gloria Haro']	114.0

Using Deep Learning to Value Defensive Actions in Football Event-Data	Charbel Merhej	2021-06-03 12:18:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01786v1	Objectively quantifying the value of player actions in football (soccer) is a challenging problem. To date, studies in football analytics have mainly focused on the attacking side of the game, while there has been less work on event-driven metrics for valuing defensive actions (e.g., tackles and interceptions). Therefore in this paper, we use deep learning techniques to define a novel metric that values such defensive actions by studying the threat of passages of play that preceded them. By doing so, we are able to value defensive actions based on what they prevented from happening in the game. Our Defensive Action Expected Threat (DAxT) model has been validated using real-world event-data from the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 English Premier League seasons, and we combine our model outputs with additional features to derive an overall rating of defensive ability for players. Overall, we find that our model is able to predict the impact of defensive actions allowing us to better value defenders using event-data.			arxiv	['Ryan Beal', 'Sarvapali Ramchurn', 'Tim Matthews']	115.0
365	Effect of Key Match Events on Football Passmaps	Vid Stropnik	2021-08-11 17:49:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05343v1	A team of association football players may be envisioned as a directed network with player nodes and weighted pass edges. Such a simplistic representation of an otherwise complex structure yields several benefits, but also permits the application of well-established network analysis approaches, to gain insights into the match flow. The authors of this work propose the application of these, including centrality measures, community detection methods, and the analysis of induced subgraphs, to analyze the potential effects certain match events have on the team. In addition to reporting on their findings, they emphasize their work's contribution of over 9000 novel football network representations to the Network Analysis community.			arxiv	['Vuk Đuranović', 'Maruša Oražem']	116.0
366	Analyzing the Behavior of Soccer Fans from a Mobile Phone Network Perspective: Euro 2016, a Case Study	Gergő Pintér	2021-08-17 13:07:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09291v1	In this study, we analyzed one month of Call Detail Records, covering Budapest in June, 2016. During this observation period, the 2016 UEFA European Football Championship took place, where the Hungarian national football team did well, beyond expectations. This case study focuses on the fans' behavior in Budapest, during and after the Hungarian matches, from the perspective of the mobile phone network data. Tense rooting, joy of scoring a goal, self-forgetting celebration because of winning the group. All of these have an effect on the data, that can be simply revealed. We used descriptive statistical methods to analyze the available data set, and managed to demonstrate the potential of this kind of data at social sensing. We found that the mobile phone network activity reflects the football fans' behavior, even if the match is played in another country.			arxiv	['Imre Felde']	117.0
367	Clustering of football players based on performance data and aggregated clustering validity indexes	Serhat Akhanli	2022-04-20 21:46:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09793v1	We analyse football (soccer) player performance data with mixed type variables from the 2014-15 season of eight European major leagues. We cluster these data based on a tailor-made dissimilarity measure. In order to decide between the many available clustering methods and to choose an appropriate number of clusters, we use the approach by Akhanli and Hennig (2020). This is based on several validation criteria that refer to different desirable characteristics of a clustering. These characteristics are chosen based on the aim of clustering, and this allows to define a suitable validation index as weighted average of calibrated individual indexes measuring the desirable features. We derive two different clusterings. The first one is a partition of the data set into major groups of essentially different players, which can be used for the analysis of a team's composition. The second one divides the data set into many small clusters (with 10 players on average), which can be used for finding players with a very similar profile to a given player. It is discussed in depth what characteristics are desirable for these clusterings. Weighting the criteria for the second clustering is informed by a survey of football experts.			arxiv	['Christian Hennig']	118.0
368	The Second-Order Football-Pool Problem and the Optimal Rate of Generalized-Covering Codes	Dor Elimelech	2022-10-02 14:23:10	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00531v1	The goal of the classic football-pool problem is to determine how many lottery tickets are to be bought in order to guarantee at least $n-r$ correct guesses out of a sequence of $n$ games played. We study a generalized (second-order) version of this problem, in which any of these $n$ games consists of two sub-games. The second-order version of the football-pool problem is formulated using the notion of generalized-covering radius, recently proposed as a fundamental property of linear codes. We consider an extension of this property to general (not necessarily linear) codes, and provide an asymptotic solution to our problem by finding the optimal rate function of second-order covering codes given a fixed normalized covering radius. We also prove that the fraction of second-order covering codes among codes of sufficiently large rate tends to $1$ as the code length tends to $\infty$.			arxiv	['Moshe Schwartz']	119.0
369	Going for GOAL: A Resource for Grounded Football Commentaries	Alessandro Suglia	2022-11-08 20:04:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04534v1	Recent video+language datasets cover domains where the interaction is highly structured, such as instructional videos, or where the interaction is scripted, such as TV shows. Both of these properties can lead to spurious cues to be exploited by models rather than learning to ground language. In this paper, we present GrOunded footbAlL commentaries (GOAL), a novel dataset of football (or `soccer') highlights videos with transcribed live commentaries in English. As the course of a game is unpredictable, so are commentaries, which makes them a unique resource to investigate dynamic language grounding. We also provide state-of-the-art baselines for the following tasks: frame reordering, moment retrieval, live commentary retrieval and play-by-play live commentary generation. Results show that SOTA models perform reasonably well in most tasks. We discuss the implications of these results and suggest new tasks for which GOAL can be used. Our codebase is available at: https://gitlab.com/grounded-sport-convai/goal-baselines.			arxiv	['José Lopes', 'Emanuele Bastianelli', 'Andrea Vanzo', 'Shubham Agarwal', 'Malvina Nikandrou', 'Lu Yu', 'Ioannis Konstas', 'Verena Rieser']	120.0
370	Location analysis of players in UEFA EURO 2020 and 2022 using generalized valuation of defense by estimating probabilities	Rikuhei Umemoto	2022-11-30 12:43:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00021v1	Analyzing defenses in team sports is generally challenging because of the limited event data. Researchers have previously proposed methods to evaluate football team defense by predicting the events of ball gain and being attacked using locations of all players and the ball. However, they did not consider the importance of the events, assumed the perfect observation of all 22 players, and did not fully investigated the influence of the diversity (e.g., nationality and sex). Here, we propose a generalized valuation method of defensive teams by score-scaling the predicted probabilities of the events. Using the open-source location data of all players in broadcast video frames in football games of men's Euro 2020 and women's Euro 2022, we investigated the effect of the number of players on the prediction and validated our approach by analyzing the games. Results show that for the predictions of being attacked, scoring, and conceding, all players' information was not necessary, while that of ball gain required information on three to four offensive and defensive players. With game analyses we explained the excellence in defense of finalist teams in Euro 2020. Our approach might be applicable to location data from broadcast video frames in football games.			arxiv	['Kazushi Tsutsui', 'Keisuke Fujii']	121.0
371	Optimal selection of the starting lineup for a football team	Soudeep Deb	2023-03-22 08:49:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12385v2	The success of a football team depends on various individual skills and performances of the selected players as well as how cohesively they perform. We propose a two-stage process for selecting optimal playing eleven of a football team from its pool of available players. In the first stage a LASSO-induced modified multinomial logistic regression model is derived to analyse the probabilities of the three possible outcomes. The model considers strengths of the players in the team as well as those of the opponent, home advantage, and also the effects of individual players and player combinations beyond the recorded performances of these players. In the second stage, a GRASP-type meta-heuristic is implemented for the team selection which maximises its probability of winning. The work is illustrated with English Premier League data from 2008/09 to 2015/16. The application demonstrates that the model in the first stage furnishes valuable insights about the deciding factors for different teams whereas the optimisation steps can be effectively used to determine the best possible starting lineup under various circumstances. We propose a measure of efficiency in team selection by the team management and analyse the performance of the teams on this front.			arxiv	['Shubhabrata Das']	122.0

The valuation model leverages a ""passing matrix"" to encapsulate player interactions on the field, utilizing centrality measures to quantify individual influence. Unlike traditional approaches, this model is both metric-driven and cohort-free, providing a dynamic and individualized framework for ascertaining a player's fair market value. The methodology is empirically validated through a case study in European football, employing real-world match and financial data. The paper advances the disciplines of sports analytics and financial mathematics by offering a cross-disciplinary mechanism for player valuation, and also links together two well-known econometric methods in marginal revenue product and expected present valuation."			arxiv	['Jimmy Risk']	123.0
373	Protocol for an Observational Study on the Effects of Playing High School Football on Later Life Cognitive Functioning and Mental Health	Sameer K. Deshpande	2016-07-06 19:37:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01756v1	A potential causal relationship between head injuries sustained by NFL players and later-life neurological decline may have broad implications for participants in youth and high school football programs. However, brain trauma risk at the professional level may be different than that at the youth and high school levels and the long-term effects of participation at these levels is as-yet unclear. To investigate the effect of playing high school football on later life depression and cognitive functioning, we propose a retrospective observational study using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) of graduates from Wisconsin high schools in 1957. We compare 1,153 high school males who played varsity football to 2,751 male students who did not. 1,951 of the control subjects did not play any sport and the remaining 800 controls played a non-contact sport. We focus on two primary outcomes measured at age 65: a composite cognitive outcome measuring verbal fluency and memory and the modified CES-D depression score. To control for potential confounders we adjust for pre-exposure covariates such as IQ with matching and model-based covariate adjustment. We will conduct an ordered testing procedure that uses all 2,751 controls while controlling for possible unmeasured differences between students who played sports and those who did not. We will quantitatively assess the sensitivity of the results to potential unmeasured confounding. The study will also consider several secondary outcomes of clinical interest such as aggression and heavy drinking. The rich set of pre-exposure variables, relatively unbiased sampling, and longitudinal nature of the WLS dataset make the proposed analysis unique among related studies that rely primarily on convenience samples of football players with reported neurological symptoms.			arxiv	['Raiden B.

374	Large Scale Diverse Combinatorial Optimization: ESPN Fantasy Football Player Trades	Aaron Baughman	2021-11-04 13:39:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02859v3	Even skilled fantasy football managers can be disappointed by their mid-season rosters as some players inevitably fall short of draft day expectations. Team managers can quickly discover that their team has a low score ceiling even if they start their best active players. A novel and diverse combinatorial optimization system proposes high volume and unique player trades between complementary teams to balance trade fairness. Several algorithms create the valuation of each fantasy football player with an ensemble of computing models: Quantum Support Vector Classifier with Permutation Importance (QSVC-PI), Quantum Support Vector Classifier with Accumulated Local Effects (QSVC-ALE), Variational Quantum Circuit with Permutation Importance (VQC-PI), Hybrid Quantum Neural Network with Permutation Importance (HQNN-PI), eXtreme Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGB), and Subject Matter Expert (SME) rules. The valuation of each player is personalized based on league rules, roster, and selections. The cost of trading away a player is related to a team's roster, such as the depth at a position, slot count, and position importance. Teams are paired together for trading based on a cosine dissimilarity score so that teams can offset their strengths and weaknesses. A knapsack 0-1 algorithm computes outgoing players for each team. Postprocessors apply analytics and deep learning models to measure 6 different objective measures about each trade. Over the 2020 and 2021 National Football League (NFL) seasons, a group of 24 experts from IBM and ESPN evaluated trade quality through 10 Football Error Analysis Tool (FEAT) sessions. Our system started with 76.9% of high-quality trades and was deployed for the 2021 season with 97.3% of high-quality trades. To increase trade quantity, our quantum, classical, and rules-based computing have 100% trade uniqueness. We use Qiskit's quantum simulators throughout our work.			arxiv	['Daniel Bohm', 'Micah Forster', 'Eduardo Morales', 'Jeff Powell', 'Shaun McPartlin', 'Raja Hebbar', 'Kavitha Yogaraj', 'Yoshika Chhabra', 'Sudeep Ghosh', 'Rukhsan Ul Haq', 'Arjun Kashyap']	125.0
375	Robust analysis of second-leg home advantage in UEFA football through better nonparametric confidence intervals for binary regression functions	Gery Geenens	2017-01-26 02:49:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07555v1	In international football (soccer), two-legged knockout ties, with each team playing at home in one leg and the final outcome decided on aggregate, are common. Many players, managers and followers seem to believe in the `second-leg home advantage', i.e. that it is beneficial to play at home on the second leg. A more complex effect than the usual and well-established home advantage, it is harder to identify, and previous statistical studies did not prove conclusive about its actuality. Yet, given the amount of money handled in international football competitions nowadays, the question of existence or otherwise of this effect is of real import. As opposed to previous research, this paper addresses it from a purely nonparametric perspective and brings a very objective answer, not based on any particular model specification which could orientate the analysis in one or the other direction. Along the way, the paper reviews the well-known shortcomings of the Wald confidence interval for a proportion, suggests new nonparametric confidence intervals for conditional probability functions, revisits the problem of the bias when building confidence intervals in nonparametric regression, and provides a novel bootstrap-based solution to it. Finally, the new intervals are used in a careful analysis of game outcome data for the UEFA Champions and Europa leagues from 2009/10 to 2014/15. A slight `second-leg home advantage' is evidenced.			arxiv	['Thomas Cuddihy']	126.0
376	Predictive modelling of training loads and injury in Australian football	David L. Carey	2017-06-14 07:09:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04336v1	To investigate whether training load monitoring data could be used to predict injuries in elite Australian football players, data were collected from elite athletes over 3 seasons at an Australian football club. Loads were quantified using GPS devices, accelerometers and player perceived exertion ratings. Absolute and relative training load metrics were calculated for each player each day (rolling average, exponentially weighted moving average, acute:chronic workload ratio, monotony and strain). Injury prediction models (regularised logistic regression, generalised estimating equations, random forests and support vector machines) were built for non-contact, non-contact time-loss and hamstring specific injuries using the first two seasons of data. Injury predictions were generated for the third season and evaluated using the area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUC). Predictive performance was only marginally better than chance for models of non-contact and non-contact time-loss injuries (AUC$<$0.65). The best performing model was a multivariate logistic regression for hamstring injuries (best AUC=0.76). Learning curves suggested logistic regression was underfitting the load-injury relationship and that using a more complex model or increasing the amount of model building data may lead to future improvements. Injury prediction models built using training load data from a single club showed poor ability to predict injuries when tested on previously unseen data, suggesting they are limited as a daily decision tool for practitioners. Focusing the modelling approach on specific injury types and increasing the amount of training data may lead to the development of improved predictive models for injury prevention.			arxiv	['Kok-Leong Ong', 'Rod Whiteley', 'Kay M.

377	Passive Cervical Spine Ligaments Provide Stability during Head Impacts in Vivo	Calvin Kuo	2019-04-02 18:17:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03102v1	It has long been suggested that neck muscle strength and anticipatory cocontraction can decrease head motions during head impacts. Here, we quantify the relative angular impulse contributions of neck soft tissue to head stabilization using a musculoskeletal model with Hill-type muscles and rate-dependent ligaments. We simulated sagittal extension and lateral flexion mild experimental head impacts performed on 10 subjects with relaxed or cocontracted muscles, and median American football head impacts. We estimated angular impulses from active muscle, passive muscle, and ligaments during head impact acceleration and deceleration phases. During the acceleration phase, active musculature produced resistive angular impulses that were 30% of the impact angular impulse in experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. This was reduced below 20% in football impacts. During the deceleration phase, active musculature stabilized the head with 50% of the impact angular impulse in experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. However, passive ligaments provided greater stabilizing angular impulses in football impacts. The redistribution of stabilizing angular impulses results from ligament and muscle dependence on lengthening rate, where ligaments stiffen substantially compared to active muscle at high lengthening rates. Thus, ligaments provide relatively greater deceleration impulses in these impacts, which limits the effectiveness of muscle strengthening or anticipated activations.			arxiv	['Jodie Sheffels', 'Michael Fanton', 'Ina Bianca Yu', 'Rosa Hamalainen', 'David Camarillo']	128.0
378	Alterations in Structural Correlation Networks with Prior Concussion in Collision-Sport Athletes	Muhammad Usman Sadiq	2019-04-18 17:34:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10924v1	Several studies have used structural correlation networks, derived from anatomical covariance of brain regions, to analyze neurologic changes associated with multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia and breast cancer [1][2]. Graph-theoretical analyses of human brain structural networks have consistently shown the characteristic of small-worldness that reflects a network with both high segregation and high integration. A large neuroimaging literature on football players, with and without history of concussion, has shown both functional and anatomical changes. Here we use graph-based topological properties of anatomical correlation networks to study the effect of prior concussion in collision-sport athletes. 40 high school collision-sport athletes (23 male football, 17 female soccer; CSA) without self-reported history of concussion (HOC-), 18 athletes (13 male football, 5 female soccer) with self-reported history of concussion (HOC+) and 24 healthy controls (19 male, 5 female; CN) participated in imaging sessions before the beginning of a competition season. The extracted residual volumes for each group were used for building the correlation networks and their small-worldness, , is calculated. The small-worldness of CSA without prior history of concussion, , is significantly greater than that of controls, . CSA with prior history have significantly higher (vs. 95% confidence interval) small-worldness compared to HOC+, over a range of network densities. The longer path lengths in HOC+ group could indicate disrupted neuronal integration relative to healthy controls.			arxiv	['Diana Svaldi', 'Trey Shenk', 'Evan Breedlove', 'Victoria Poole', 'Greg Tamer', 'Kausar Abbas', 'Thomas Talavage']	129.0

Comparing the Information Content of Games in the Four Major US Sports	Julian Wolfson	2015-01-28 16:31:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07179v1	"In the four major North American professional sports (baseball, basketball, football, and hockey), the primary purpose of the regular season is to determine which teams most deserve to advance to the playoffs. Interestingly, while the ultimate goal of identifying the best teams is the same, the number of regular season games played differs dramatically between the sports, ranging from 16 (football) to 82 (basketball and hockey) to 162 (baseball). Though length of season is partially determined by many factors including travel logistics, rest requirements, playoff structure and television contracts, it is hard to reconcile the 10-fold difference in the number of games between, for example, the NFL and MLB unless football games are somehow more ""informative"" than baseball games. In this paper, we aim to quantify the amount of information games yield about the relative strength of the teams involved. Our strategy is to assess how well simple paired comparison models fitted from $X%$ of the games within a season predict the outcomes of the remaining $(100-X)%$ of games, for multiple values of $X$. We compare the resulting predictive accuracy curves between seasons within the same sport and across all four sports, and find dramatic differences in the amount of information yielded by individual game results in the four major U.S. sports."			arxiv	['Joseph S.

380	Evaluating probabilistic forecasts of football matches: The case against the Ranked Probability Score	Edward Wheatcroft	2019-08-23 19:04:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08980v1	A scoring rule is a function of a probabilistic forecast and a corresponding outcome that is used to evaluate forecast performance. A wide range of scoring rules have been defined over time and there is some debate as to which are the most appropriate for evaluating the performance of forecasts of sporting events. This paper focuses on forecasts of the outcomes of football matches. The ranked probability score (RPS) is often recommended since it is `sensitive to distance', that is it takes into account the ordering in the outcomes (a home win is `closer' to a draw than it is to an away win, for example). In this paper, this reasoning is disputed on the basis that it adds nothing in terms of the actual aims of using scoring rules. A related property of scoring rules is locality. A scoring rule is local if it only takes the probability placed on the outcome into consideration. Two simulation experiments are carried out in the context of football matches to compare the performance of the RPS, which is non-local and sensitive to distance, the Brier score, which is non-local and insensitive to distance, and the ignorance score, which is local and insensitive to distance. The ignorance score is found to outperform both the RPS and the Brier score, casting doubt on the value of non-locality and sensitivity to distance as properties of scoring rules in this context.			arxiv	[]	131.0
381	"""Does 4-4-2 exist?"" -- An Analytics Approach to Understand and Classify Football Team Formations in Single Match Situations"	Eric Müller-Budack	2019-09-02 16:14:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00412v1	The chances to win a football match can be significantly increased if the right tactic is chosen and the behavior of the opposite team is well anticipated. For this reason, every professional football club employs a team of game analysts. However, at present game performance analysis is done manually and therefore highly time-consuming. Consequently, automated tools to support the analysis process are required. In this context, one of the main tasks is to summarize team formations by patterns such as 4-4-2. In this paper, we introduce an analytics approach that automatically classifies and visualizes the team formation based on the players' position data. We focus on single match situations instead of complete halftimes or matches to provide a more detailed analysis. A detailed analysis of individual match situations depending on ball possession and match segment length is provided. For this purpose, a visual summary is utilized that summarizes the team formation in a match segment. An expert annotation study is conducted that demonstrates 1) the complexity of the task and 2) the usefulness of the visualization of single situations to understand team formations. The suggested classification approach outperforms existing methods for formation classification. In particular, our approach gives insights about the shortcomings of using patterns like 4-4-2 to describe team formations.			arxiv	['Jonas Theiner', 'Robert Rein', 'Ralph Ewerth']	132.0
382	Prevention of Traumatic Brain Injury with Liquid Shock Absorption	Hossein Vahid Alizadeh	2019-10-17 05:47:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07722v1	The discovery that repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can result in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in high risk contact sports has led to increased scrutiny of head protective gear. In this work, we asked if it was physically possible to prevent mTBI in American football with helmets alone. Here, we show that modern helmets of several types are unlikely to prevent mTBI from high speed collisions as might be seen in the NFL, but that introducing liquid as an energy absorbing medium can dramatically reduce the forces of impact across a spectrum of impact severities. We hypothesized that a helmet which transmits a nearly constant force during football impacts is sufficient to reduce biomechanical loading in the brain below the threshold of mTBI. To test this hypothesis, we first show that the optimal impact force transmitted to the head, in terms of brain strain, is in fact a constant force profile. Then, to generate a constant force with a helmet, we implement a computational model of a fluid-based shock absorber that adapts passively to any given impact speed. Computer simulation of head impacts with liquid shock absorption indicate that, at the highest impact speed, the average brain tissue strain is reduced by 27.6% $\pm$ 9.3 compared to existing helmet padding that is available on the market. These simulations are based on the NFL's helmet test protocol and predict that adding liquid shock absorbers could reduce the number of concussions by at least 75%. Taken together, these results suggest that the majority of mTBI in football could be prevented with more efficient helmet technology.			arxiv	['Michael G. Fanton', 'August G.

383	Robustness of football passing networks against continuous node and link removals	Genki Ichinose	2020-03-27 10:05:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13465v2	We can construct passing networks when we regard a player as a node and a pass as a link in football games. Thus, we can analyze the networks by using tools developed in network science. Among various metrics characterizing a network, centrality metrics have often been used to identify key players in a passing network. However, a tolerance to players being marked or passes being blocked in a passing network, namely the robustness of the network, has been poorly understood so far. Because the robustness of a passing network can be connected to the increase of ball possession, it would be deeply related to the outcome of a game. Here, we developed position-dependent passing networks of 45 matches by 18 teams belonging to the Japan Professional Football League. Then, nodes or links were continuously removed from the passing networks by two removal methods so that we could evaluate the robustness of these networks against the removals. The results show that these passing networks commonly contain hubs (key players making passes). Then, we analyzed the most robust networks in detail and found that their full backs increase the robustness by often invoking a heavier emphasis on attack. Moreover, we showed that the robustness of the passing networks and the team performance have a positive correlation.			arxiv	['Tomohiro Tsuchiya', 'Shunsuke Watanabe']	134.0
384	Validation and Comparison of Instrumented Mouthguards for Measuring Head Kinematics and Assessing Brain Deformation in Football Impacts	Yuzhe Liu	2020-08-05 01:41:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01903v2	Because of the relatively rigid coupling between the upper dentition and the skull, instrumented mouthguards have been shown to be a viable way of measuring head impact kinematics for assisting in understanding the underlying biomechanics of concussions. This has led various companies and institutions to further develop instrumented mouthguards. However, their use as a research tool for understanding concussive impacts makes quantification of their accuracy critical, especially given the conflicting results from various recent studies. Here we present a study that uses a pneumatic impactor to deliver impacts characteristic to football to a Hybrid III headform, in order to validate and compare five of the most commonly used instrumented mouthguards. We found that all tested mouthguards gave accurate measurements for the peak angular acceleration (mean relative error, MRE < 13%), the peak angular velocity (MRE < 8%), brain injury criteria values (MRE < 13%) and brain deformation (described as maximum principal strain and fiber strain, calculated by a convolutional neural network based brain model, MRE < 9%). Finally, we found that the accuracy of the measurement varies with the impact locations yet is not sensitive to the impact velocity for the most part.			arxiv	['August G.

385	G-Elo: Generalization of the Elo algorithm by modelling the discretized margin of victory	Leszek Szczecinski	2020-10-20 03:55:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11187v3	In this work we develop a new algorithm for rating of teams (or players) in one-on-one games by exploiting the observed difference of the game-points (such as goals), also known as a margin of victory (MOV). Our objective is to obtain the Elo-style algorithm whose operation is simple to implement and to understand intuitively. This is done in three steps: first, we define the probabilistic model between the teams' skills and the discretized MOV variable: this generalizes the model underpinning the Elo algorithm, where the MOV variable is discretized into three categories (win/loss/draw). Second, with the formal probabilistic model at hand, the optimization required by the maximum likelihood rule is implemented via stochastic gradient; this yields simple on-line equations for the rating updates which are identical in their general form to those characteristic of the Elo algorithm: the main difference lies in the way the scores and the expected scores are defined. Third, we propose a simple method to estimate the coefficients of the model, and thus define the operation of the algorithm; it is done in a closed form using the historical data so the algorithm is tailored to the sport of interest and the coefficients defining its operation are determined in entirely transparent manner. The alternative, optimization-based strategy to find the coefficients is also presented. We show numerical examples based on the results of the association football of the English Premier League and the American football of the National Football League.			arxiv	[]	136.0
386	Time-series Imputation of Temporally-occluded Multiagent Trajectories	Shayegan Omidshafiei	2021-06-08 09:58:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04219v1	In multiagent environments, several decision-making individuals interact while adhering to the dynamics constraints imposed by the environment. These interactions, combined with the potential stochasticity of the agents' decision-making processes, make such systems complex and interesting to study from a dynamical perspective. Significant research has been conducted on learning models for forward-direction estimation of agent behaviors, for example, pedestrian predictions used for collision-avoidance in self-driving cars. However, in many settings, only sporadic observations of agents may be available in a given trajectory sequence. For instance, in football, subsets of players may come in and out of view of broadcast video footage, while unobserved players continue to interact off-screen. In this paper, we study the problem of multiagent time-series imputation, where available past and future observations of subsets of agents are used to estimate missing observations for other agents. Our approach, called the Graph Imputer, uses forward- and backward-information in combination with graph networks and variational autoencoders to enable learning of a distribution of imputed trajectories. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of football matches, using a projective camera module to train and evaluate our model for the off-screen player state estimation setting. We illustrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches, including those hand-crafted for football.			arxiv	['Daniel Hennes', 'Marta Garnelo', 'Eugene Tarassov', 'Zhe Wang', 'Romuald Elie', 'Jerome T.

The most watched American football league in the world is the United States' National Football League (NFL), where every offensive play can be either a run or a pass, and in this work we focus on passes. Many factors can affect the probability of pass completion, such as receiver separation from the nearest defender, distance from receiver to passer, offense formation, among many others. When predicting the completion probability of a pass, it is essential to know who the target of the pass is. By using distance measures between players and the ball, it is possible to calculate empirical probabilities and predict very accurately who the target will be. The big question is: how likely is it for a pass to be completed in an NFL match while the ball is in the air? We developed a machine learning algorithm to answer this based on several predictors. Using data from the 2018 NFL season, we obtained conditional and marginal predictions for pass completion probability based on a random forest model. This is based on a two-stage procedure: first, we calculate the probability of each offensive player being the pass target, then, conditional on the target, we predict completion probability based on the random forest model. Finally, the general completion probability can be calculated using the law of total probability. We present animations for selected plays and show the pass completion probability evolution.			arxiv	['Rafael de Andrade Moral']	138.0
388	Analyzing the Behavior and Financial Status of Soccer Fans from a Mobile Phone Network Perspective: Euro 2016, a Case Study	Gergő Pintér	2021-11-15 11:40:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07685v1	In this study, Call Detail Records (CDRs), covering Budapest, for the month of June in 2016 has been analyzed. During this observation period, the 2016 UEFA European Football Championship took place, which affected significantly the habit of the residents, despite the fact that not a single match was played in the city. We evaluated the fans' behavior in Budapest, during and after the Hungarian matches, and found that the mobile phone network activity reflects the football fans' behavior, demonstrating the potential of mobile phone network data within a social sensing system. The Call Detail Records are enriched with mobile phone properties to analyze the subscribers' devices. Applying the device information (Type Allocation Code) from the activity records, the Subscriber Identity Modules, that do not operate in cell phones are omitted from mobility analyses, allowing to focus on people. The mobile phone price is proposed and evaluated as a socioeconomic indicator, and correlation between the phone price and the mobility customs have been found. We also found that, beside the cell phone price, the subscriber age and the subscription type also have an effect on the mobility. On the other hand, these do not seem to affect the interest in football.			arxiv	['Imre Felde']	139.0
389	A Survey on Video Action Recognition in Sports: Datasets, Methods and Applications	Fei Wu	2022-06-02 13:19:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01038v1	To understand human behaviors, action recognition based on videos is a common approach. Compared with image-based action recognition, videos provide much more information. Reducing the ambiguity of actions and in the last decade, many works focused on datasets, novel models and learning approaches have improved video action recognition to a higher level. However, there are challenges and unsolved problems, in particular in sports analytics where data collection and labeling are more sophisticated, requiring sport professionals to annotate data. In addition, the actions could be extremely fast and it becomes difficult to recognize them. Moreover, in team sports like football and basketball, one action could involve multiple players, and to correctly recognize them, we need to analyse all players, which is relatively complicated. In this paper, we present a survey on video action recognition for sports analytics. We introduce more than ten types of sports, including team sports, such as football, basketball, volleyball, hockey and individual sports, such as figure skating, gymnastics, table tennis, tennis, diving and badminton. Then we compare numerous existing frameworks for sports analysis to present status quo of video action recognition in both team sports and individual sports. Finally, we discuss the challenges and unsolved problems in this area and to facilitate sports analytics, we develop a toolbox using PaddlePaddle, which supports football, basketball, table tennis and figure skating action recognition.			arxiv	['Qingzhong Wang', 'Jian Bian', 'Haoyi Xiong', 'Ning Ding', 'Feixiang Lu', 'Jun Cheng', 'Dejing Dou']	140.0
390	Preliminary Examination of Guardian Cap Head Impact Data Using Instrumented Mouthguards	Kristen G. Quigley	2023-02-21 22:44:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11038v1	Purpose The objective of this study is to present preliminary on-field head kinematics data for NCAA Division I American football players through closely matched pre-season workouts both with and without Guardian Caps (GCs). Methods 42 NCAA Division I American football players wore instrumented mouthguards (iMMs) for 6 closely matched workouts, 3 in traditional helmets (PRE) and 3 with GCs (POST) affixed to the exterior of their helmets. This includes 7 players who had consistent data through all workouts. Results There was no significant difference between the collapsed mean values for the entire sample between PRE and POST for peak linear acceleration (PLA) (PRE=16.3, POST=17.2Gs; p=0.20), Peak Angular Acceleration (PAA) (PRE=992.1, POST=1029.4rad/s2; p=0.51 and the total amount of impacts (PRE=9.3, POST=9.7; p=0.72). Similarly, no difference was observed between PRE and POST for PLA (PRE=16.1, POST=17.2Gs; p=0.32), PAA (PRE=951.2, POST=1038.0rad/s2; p=0.29 and total impacts (PRE=9.6, POST=9.7; p=0.32) between sessions for the 7 repeated players. Conclusion These data suggest no difference in head kinematics data (PLA, PAA and total impacts) when GCs are worn. This study suggests GCs are not effective in reducing the magnitude of head impacts experienced by NCAA Division I American football players.			arxiv	['Dustin Hopfe', 'Madison R.

391	Embedding Contextual Information through Reward Shaping in Multi-Agent Learning: A Case Study from Google Football	Chaoyi Gu	2023-03-25 10:21:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15471v3	Artificial Intelligence has been used to help human complete difficult tasks in complicated environments by providing optimized strategies for decision-making or replacing the manual labour. In environments including multiple agents, such as football, the most common methods to train agents are Imitation Learning and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, the agents trained by Imitation Learning cannot outperform the expert demonstrator, which makes humans hardly get new insights from the learnt policy. Besides, MARL is prone to the credit assignment problem. In environments with sparse reward signal, this method can be inefficient. The objective of our research is to create a novel reward shaping method by embedding contextual information in reward function to solve the aforementioned challenges. We demonstrate this in the Google Research Football (GRF) environment. We quantify the contextual information extracted from game state observation and use this quantification together with original sparse reward to create the shaped reward. The experiment results in the GRF environment prove that our reward shaping method is a useful addition to state-of-the-art MARL algorithms for training agents in environments with sparse reward signal.			arxiv	['Varuna De Silva', 'Corentin Artaud', 'Rafael Pina']	142.0
392	Adaptive action supervision in reinforcement learning from real-world multi-agent demonstrations	Keisuke Fujii	2023-05-22 13:33:37	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13030v4	Modeling of real-world biological multi-agents is a fundamental problem in various scientific and engineering fields. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework to generate flexible and diverse behaviors in cyberspace; however, when modeling real-world biological multi-agents, there is a domain gap between behaviors in the source (i.e., real-world data) and the target (i.e., cyberspace for RL), and the source environment parameters are usually unknown. In this paper, we propose a method for adaptive action supervision in RL from real-world demonstrations in multi-agent scenarios. We adopt an approach that combines RL and supervised learning by selecting actions of demonstrations in RL based on the minimum distance of dynamic time warping for utilizing the information of the unknown source dynamics. This approach can be easily applied to many existing neural network architectures and provide us with an RL model balanced between reproducibility as imitation and generalization ability to obtain rewards in cyberspace. In the experiments, using chase-and-escape and football tasks with the different dynamics between the unknown source and target environments, we show that our approach achieved a balance between the reproducibility and the generalization ability compared with the baselines. In particular, we used the tracking data of professional football players as expert demonstrations in football and show successful performances despite the larger gap between behaviors in the source and target environments than the chase-and-escape task.			arxiv	['Kazushi Tsutsui', 'Atom Scott', 'Hiroshi Nakahara', 'Naoya Takeishi', 'Yoshinobu Kawahara']	143.0
393	A Strategic Framework for Optimal Decisions in Football 1-vs-1 Shot-Taking Situations: An Integrated Approach of Machine Learning, Theory-Based Modeling, and Game Theory	Calvin C. K. Yeung	2023-07-27 09:42:25	http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14732v1	Complex interactions between two opposing agents frequently occur in domains of machine learning, game theory, and other application domains. Quantitatively analyzing the strategies involved can provide an objective basis for decision-making. One such critical scenario is shot-taking in football, where decisions, such as whether the attacker should shoot or pass the ball and whether the defender should attempt to block the shot, play a crucial role in the outcome of the game. However, there are currently no effective data-driven and/or theory-based approaches to analyzing such situations. To address this issue, we proposed a novel framework to analyze such scenarios based on game theory, where we estimate the expected payoff with machine learning (ML) models, and additional features for ML models were extracted with a theory-based shot block model. Conventionally, successes or failures (1 or 0) are used as payoffs, while a success shot (goal) is extremely rare in football. Therefore, we proposed the Expected Probability of Shot On Target (xSOT) metric to evaluate players' actions even if the shot results in no goal; this allows for effective differentiation and comparison between different shots and even enables counterfactual shot situation analysis. In our experiments, we have validated the framework by comparing it with baseline and ablated models. Furthermore, we have observed a high correlation between the xSOT and existing metrics. This alignment of information suggests that xSOT provides valuable insights. Lastly, as an illustration, we studied optimal strategies in the World Cup 2022 and analyzed a shot situation in EURO 2020.			arxiv	['Keisuke Fujii']	144.0
394	SciSports: Learning football kinematics through two-dimensional tracking data	Anatoliy Babic	2018-08-14 06:40:01	http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04550v1	SciSports is a Dutch startup company specializing in football analytics. This paper describes a joint research effort with SciSports, during the Study Group Mathematics with Industry 2018 at Eindhoven, the Netherlands. The main challenge that we addressed was to automatically process empirical football players' trajectories, in order to extract useful information from them. The data provided to us was two-dimensional positional data during entire matches. We developed methods based on Newtonian mechanics and the Kalman filter, Generative Adversarial Nets and Variational Autoencoders. In addition, we trained a discriminator network to recognize and discern different movement patterns of players. The Kalman-filter approach yields an interpretable model, in which a small number of player-dependent parameters can be fit; in theory this could be used to distinguish among players. The Generative-Adversarial-Nets approach appears promising in theory, and some initial tests showed an improvement with respect to the baseline, but the limits in time and computational power meant that we could not fully explore it. We also trained a Discriminator network to distinguish between two players based on their trajectories; after training, the network managed to distinguish between some pairs of players, but not between others. After training, the Variational Autoencoders generated trajectories that are difficult to distinguish, visually, from the data. These experiments provide an indication that deep generative models can learn the underlying structure and statistics of football players' trajectories. This can serve as a starting point for determining player qualities based on such trajectory data.			arxiv	['Harshit Bansal', 'Gianluca Finocchio', 'Julian Golak', 'Mark Peletier', 'Jim Portegies', 'Clara Stegehuis', 'Anuj Tyagi', 'Roland Vincze', 'William Weimin Yoo']	145.0

396	TacticAI: an AI assistant for football tactics	Zhe Wang	2023-10-16 16:25:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10553v2	Identifying key patterns of tactics implemented by rival teams, and developing effective responses, lies at the heart of modern football. However, doing so algorithmically remains an open research challenge. To address this unmet need, we propose TacticAI, an AI football tactics assistant developed and evaluated in close collaboration with domain experts from Liverpool FC. We focus on analysing corner kicks, as they offer coaches the most direct opportunities for interventions and improvements. TacticAI incorporates both a predictive and a generative component, allowing the coaches to effectively sample and explore alternative player setups for each corner kick routine and to select those with the highest predicted likelihood of success. We validate TacticAI on a number of relevant benchmark tasks: predicting receivers and shot attempts and recommending player position adjustments. The utility of TacticAI is validated by a qualitative study conducted with football domain experts at Liverpool FC. We show that TacticAI's model suggestions are not only indistinguishable from real tactics, but also favoured over existing tactics 90% of the time, and that TacticAI offers an effective corner kick retrieval system. TacticAI achieves these results despite the limited availability of gold-standard data, achieving data efficiency through geometric deep learning.			arxiv	['Petar Veličković', 'Daniel Hennes', 'Nenad Tomašev', 'Laurel Prince', 'Michael Kaisers', 'Yoram Bachrach', 'Romuald Elie', 'Li Kevin Wenliang', 'Federico Piccinini', 'William Spearman', 'Ian Graham', 'Jerome Connor', 'Yi Yang', 'Adrià Recasens', 'Mina Khan', 'Nathalie Beauguerlange', 'Pablo Sprechmann', 'Pol Moreno', 'Nicolas Heess', 'Michael Bowling', 'Demis Hassabis', 'Karl Tuyls']	147.0

The probability density functions (PDFs) of goals scored cannot be fitted over their entire ranges by Poisson or negative binomial distributions; here, we compare the PDFs with those arising from extremal statistics. In addition, we show that it is sufficient to model English top division and FA Cup matches in the seasons of 1970/71 to 2000/01 on Poisson or negative binomial distributions, as reported in analyses of earlier seasons, and that these are not consistent with extremal statistics.			arxiv	['P.

The action of the model is defined using a measure of integration built of degrees of freedom independent of the metric. There is no need to fine tune any bulk cosmological constant or the tension of the two (in the scenario described here) parallel branes to obtain zero cosmological constant, the only solutions are those with zero 4-D cosmological constant.

Carroll	2003-02-11 02:29:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0302067v1	We present an exact solution for a factorizable brane-world spacetime with two extra dimensions and explicit brane sources. The compactification manifold has the topology of a two-sphere, and is stabilized by a bulk cosmological constant and magnetic flux. The geometry of the sphere is locally round except for conical singularities at the locations of two antipodal branes, deforming the sphere into an American-style football. The bulk magnetic flux needs to be fine-tuned to obtain flat geometry on the branes. Once this is done, the brane geometry is insensitive to the brane vacuum energy, which only affects the conical deficit angle of the extra dimensions. Solutions of this form provide a new arena in which to explore brane-world phenomenology and the effects of extra dimensions on the cosmological constant problem.			arxiv	['Monica M. Guica']	150.0

They defy the very traditional meaning of the fixed point that a point on the fixed point in the phase space should remain there forever, for, a fixed point can evolve as well!

As a consequence, we obtain the football solution with 4D Minkowski space as a new supersymmetric background that preserves 4D N=1 SUSY. In the presence of brane multiplets, we derive the 4D effective supergravity action for the football background and show that the remaining modulus can be stabilized by a bulk non-perturbative correction with brane uplifting potentials at a zero vacuum energy. We find that the U(1)_R mediation can be a dominant source of SUSY breaking for a brane scalar with nonzero R charge.			arxiv	[]	152.0

We propose in this paper a non-parametric algorithm dedicated to segment and to detect objects in color images issued from a football sports meeting. Indeed segmentation by pixel concern many applications and revealed how the method is robust to detect objects, even in presence of strong shadows and highlights. In the other hand to refine their playing strategy such as in football, handball, volley ball, Rugby..., the coach need to have a maximum of technical-tactics information about the on-going of the game and the players. We propose in this paper a range of algorithms allowing the resolution of many problems appearing in the automated process of team identification, where each player is affected to his corresponding team relying on visual data. The developed system was tested on a match of the Tunisian national competition. This work is prominent for many next computer vision studies as it's detailed in this study.			arxiv	['Mourad Moussa Jlassi']	153.0

Using passing data made available by FIFA during the 2010 World Cup, we construct for each team a weighted and directed network in which nodes correspond to players and arrows to passes. The resulting network or graph provides a direct visual inspection of a team's strategy, from which we can identify play pattern, determine hot-spots on the play and localize potential weaknesses. Using different centrality measures, we can also determine the relative importance of each player in the game, the `popularity' of a player, and the effect of removing players from the game.			arxiv	['Hugo Touchette']	154.0

In a series of six variations on this theme, we prove corresponding results for principal bundles over the following schemes and stacks: (1) a line modulo the group of nth roots of unity; (2) a football, that is, an orbifold of genus zero with two marked points; (3) a gerbe over a football whose structure group is the nth roots of unity; (4) a chain of lines meeting in nodes; (5) a line modulo an action of a split torus; and (6) a chain modulo an action of a split torus.

We investigate the problem of producing an automated system to make the same evaluation of passes. We present a model that constructs numerical predictor variables from spatiotemporal match data using feature functions based on methods from computational geometry, and then learns a classification function from labelled examples of the predictor variables. Furthermore, the learned classifiers are analysed to determine if there is a relationship between the complexity of the algorithm that computed the predictor variable and the importance of the variable to the classifier. Experimental results show that we are able to produce a classifier with 85.8% accuracy on classifying passes as Good, OK or Bad, and that the predictor variables computed using complex methods from computational geometry are of moderate importance to the learned classifiers. Finally, we show that the inter-rater agreement on pass classification between the machine classifier and a human observer is of similar magnitude to the agreement between two observers.			arxiv	['Joachim Gudmundsson', 'Sanjay Chawla', 'Joël Estephan']	158.0

Here we use Japanese and German football data to investigate correlates between temporal patterns of formation changes across matches and match results. We found that individual teams and managers both showed win-stay lose-shift behavior, a type of reinforcement learning. In other words, they tended to stick to the current formation after a win and switch to a different formation after a loss. In addition, formation changes did not statistically improve the results of succeeding matches.The results indicate that a swift implementation of a new formation in the win-stay lose-shift manner may not be a successful managerial rule of thumb.			arxiv	['Naoki Masuda']	159.0

Through skill and chance, the script of each game is dynamically written in real time by players acting out possible trajectories allowed by a sport's rules. By properly characterizing a given sport's ecology of `game stories', we are able to capture the sport's capacity for unfolding interesting narratives, in part by contrasting them with random walks. Here, we explore the game story space afforded by a data set of 1,310 Australian Football League (AFL) score lines. We find that AFL games exhibit a continuous spectrum of stories rather than distinct clusters. We show how coarse-graining reveals identifiable motifs ranging from last minute comeback wins to one-sided blowouts. Through an extensive comparison with biased random walks, we show that real AFL games deliver a broader array of motifs than null models, and we provide consequent insights into the narrative appeal of real games.			arxiv	['A.

The Gaussian process perspective enables a) a principled way of dealing with uncertainty and b) rich models, specified through kernel functions. Using this connection, we tackle the problem of predicting outcomes of football matches between national teams. We develop a player kernel that relates any two football matches through the players lined up on the field. This makes it possible to share knowledge gained from observing matches between clubs (available in large quantities) and matches between national teams (available only in limited quantities). We evaluate our approach on the Euro 2008, 2012 and 2016 final tournaments.			arxiv	['Victor Kristof', 'Antonio J. González Ferrer', 'Matthias Grossglauser']	161.0

Especially, we find that there exists a characteristic interpersonal distance $ r\simeq 500 $ cm below which the circular variance for their alignment decreases rapidly. By introducing the order parameter $ \phi(t) $ in order to measure degree of alignment of players' velocity vectors, we also find that the angle distribution between the nearest players' velocity vectors becomes wrapped Cauchy ($ \phi \lesssim 0.7 $) and the mixture of von Mises and wrapped Cauchy distributions ($ \phi \gtrsim 0.7 $), respectively. To understand these findings, we construct a simple model for the motion of the two interacting players with the following rules: chasing between the players and the reset of the chasing. We numerically show that our model successfully reproduce the results obtained from the actual data. Moreover, from the numerical study, we find that there is another characteristic distance $ r\simeq 1000 $ cm below which player's chasing starts.			arxiv	['Yoshihiro Yamazaki']	162.0

We first describe the standard plus-minus methodology as used in basketball and ice-hockey and then adapt it for use in soccer. The usual goal-differential plus-minus is considered before two variations are proposed. For the first variation, we present a methodology to calculate an expected goals plus-minus rating. The second variation makes use of in-play probabilities of match outcome to evaluate an expected points plus-minus rating. We use the ratings to examine who are the best players in European football, and demonstrate how the players' ratings evolve over time. Finally, we shed light on the debate regarding which is the strongest league. The model suggests the English Premier League is the strongest, with the German Bundesliga a close runner-up.			arxiv	['Javier López Peña', 'Ian McHale']	163.0

As we will see, Network Science allows addressing different aspects of the team organization and performance not captured by classical analyses based on the performance of individual players. The reason behind relies on the complex nature of the game, which, paraphrasing the foundational paradigm of complexity sciences ""can not be analyzed by looking at its components (i.e., players) individually but, on the contrary, considering the system as a whole"" or, in the classical words of after-match interviews ""it's not just me, it's the team""."			arxiv	['J.

414	Fitting motion models to contextual player behavior	Bartholomew Spencer	2019-07-24 22:32:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10762v1	The objective of this study was to incorporate contextual information into the modelling of player movements. This was achieved by combining the distributions of forthcoming passing contests that players committed to and those they did not. The resultant array measures the probability a player would commit to forthcoming contests in their vicinity. Commitment-based motion models were fit on 46220 samples of player behavior in the Australian Football League. It was found that the shape of commitment-based models differed greatly to displacement-based models for Australian footballers. Player commitment arrays were used to measure the spatial occupancy and dominance of the attacking team. The spatial characteristics of pass receivers were extracted for 2934 passes. Positional trends in passing were identified. Furthermore, passes were clustered into three components using Gaussian mixture models. Passes in the AFL are most commonly to one-on-one contests or unmarked players. Furthermore, passes were rarely greater than 25 m.			arxiv	['Karl Jackson', 'Sam Robertson']	165.0
415	The UEFA Champions League seeding is not strategy-proof since the 2015/16 season	László Csató	2019-12-14 08:23:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06804v3	Fairness has several interpretations in sports, one of them being that the rules should guarantee incentive compatibility, namely, a team cannot be worse off due to better results in any feasible scenario. The current seeding regime of the most prestigious annual European club football tournament, the UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) Champions League, is shown to violate this requirement since the 2015/16 season. In particular, if the titleholder qualifies for the first pot by being a champion in a high-ranked league, its slot is given to a team from a lower-ranked association, which can harm a top club from the domestic championship of the titleholder. However, filling all vacancies through the national leagues excludes the presence of perverse incentives. UEFA is encouraged to introduce this policy from the 2021-24 cycle onwards.			arxiv	[]	166.0
416	Forecasting football matches by predicting match statistics	Edward Wheatcroft	2020-01-24 17:05:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09097v1	This paper considers the use of observed and predicted match statistics as inputs to forecasts of the outcomes of football matches. It is shown that, were it possible to know the match statistics in advance, highly informative forecasts of the match outcome could be made. Whilst, in practice, match statistics are never available prior to the match, this leads to a simple philosophy. If match statistics can be predicted pre-match, and if those predictions are accurate enough, it follows that informative match forecasts can be made. It is shown that Generalised Attacking Performance (GAP) ratings, introduced in a recent paper, provide a suitable methodology for predicting match statistics in advance and that they are informative enough to provide information beyond that reflected in the odds. A long term and robust gambling profit is demonstrated when the forecasts are combined with two betting strategies.			arxiv	[]	167.0
417	Home advantage of European major football leagues under COVID-19 pandemic	Eiji Konaka	2021-01-02 14:37:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00457v2	Since March 2020, the environment surrounding football has changed dramatically because of the COVID-19 pandemic. After a few months' break, re-scheduled matches were held behind closed doors without spectators. The main objective of this study is a quantitative evaluation of ``crowd effects'' on home advantage, using the results of these closed matches. The proposed analysis uses pairwise comparison method to reduce the effects caused by the unbalanced schedule. The following conclusions were drawn from the statistical hypothesis tests conducted in this study: In four major European leagues, the home advantage is reduced in closed matches compared to than in the normal situation, i.e., with spectators. The reduction amounts among leagues were different. For example, in Germany, the home advantage was negative during the closed-match period. On the other hand,in England,statistically significant differences in home advantage were not observed between closed matches and normal situation.			arxiv	[]	168.0
418	A Compact Codimension Two Braneworld with Precisely One Brane	Nikolas Akerblom	2010-04-11 13:40:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.1807v3	Building on earlier work on football shaped extra dimensions, we construct a compact codimension two braneworld with precisely one brane. The two extra dimensions topologically represent a 2-torus which is stabilized by a bulk cosmological constant and magnetic flux. The torus has positive constant curvature almost everywhere, except for a single conical singularity at the location of the brane. In contradistinction to the football shaped case, there is no fine-tuning required for the brane tension. We also present some plausibility arguments why the model should not suffer from serious stability issues.			arxiv	['Gunther Cornelissen']	169.0
419	A Bayesian inference approach for determining player abilities in football	Gavin A. Whitaker	2017-09-25 13:47:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00001v2	We consider the task of determining a football player's ability for a given event type, for example, scoring a goal. We propose an interpretable Bayesian model which is fit using variational inference methods. We implement a Poisson model to capture occurrences of event types, from which we infer player abilities. Our approach also allows the visualisation of differences between players, for a specific ability, through the marginal posterior variational densities. We then use these inferred player abilities to extend the Bayesian hierarchical model of Baio and Blangiardo (2010) which captures a team's scoring rate (the rate at which they score goals). We apply the resulting scheme to the English Premier League, capturing player abilities over the 2013/2014 season, before using output from the hierarchical model to predict whether over or under 2.5 goals will be scored in a given game in the 2014/2015 season. This validates our model as a way of providing insights into team formation and the individual success of sports teams.			arxiv	['Ricardo Silva', 'Daniel Edwards', 'Ioannis Kosmidis']	170.0
420	On Elo based prediction models for the FIFA Worldcup 2018	Lorenz A. Gilch	2018-06-05 20:36:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01930v1	We propose an approach for the analysis and prediction of a football championship. It is based on Poisson regression models that include the Elo points of the teams as covariates and incorporates differences of team-specific effects. These models for the prediction of the FIFA World Cup 2018 are fitted on all football games on neutral ground of the participating teams since 2010. Based on the model estimates for single matches Monte-Carlo simulations are used to estimate probabilities for reaching the different stages in the FIFA World Cup 2018 for all teams. We propose two score functions for ordinal random variables that serve together with the rank probability score for the validation of our models with the results of the FIFA World Cups 2010 and 2014. All models favor Germany as the new FIFA World Champion. All possible courses of the tournament and their probabilities are visualized using a single Sankey diagram.			arxiv	['Sebastian Müller']	171.0

422	Unsupervised Methods for Identifying Pass Coverage Among Defensive Backs with NFL Player Tracking Data	Rishav Dutta	2019-06-26 22:48:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11373v3	"Analysis of player tracking data for American football is in its infancy, since the National Football League (NFL) released its Next Gen Stats tracking data publicly for the first time in December 2018. While tracking datasets in other sports often contain detailed annotations of on-field events, annotations in the NFL's tracking data are limited. Methods for creating these annotations typically require extensive human labeling, which is difficult and expensive. We begin tackling this class of problems by creating annotations for pass coverage types by defensive backs using unsupervised learning techniques, which require no manual labeling or human oversight. We define a set of features from the NFL's tracking data that help distinguish between ""zone"" and ""man"" coverage. We use Gaussian mixture modeling and hierarchical clustering to create clusters corresponding to each group, and we assign the appropriate type of coverage to each cluster through qualitative analysis of the plays in each cluster. We find that the mixture model's ""soft"" cluster assignments allow for more flexibility when identifying coverage types. Our work makes possible several potential avenues of future NFL research, and we provide a basic exploration of these in this paper."			arxiv	['Ronald Yurko', 'Samuel Ventura']	173.0

By effectively utilizing modern accelerators, we show that it is not only possible to train on millions of frames per second but also to lower the cost of experiments compared to current methods. We achieve this with a simple architecture that features centralized inference and an optimized communication layer. SEED adopts two state of the art distributed algorithms, IMPALA/V-trace (policy gradients) and R2D2 (Q-learning), and is evaluated on Atari-57, DeepMind Lab and Google Research Football. We improve the state of the art on Football and are able to reach state of the art on Atari-57 three times faster in wall-time. For the scenarios we consider, a 40% to 80% cost reduction for running experiments is achieved. The implementation along with experiments is open-sourced so results can be reproduced and novel ideas tried out.			arxiv	['Raphaël Marinier', 'Piotr Stanczyk', 'Ke Wang', 'Marcin Michalski']	174.0
424	A regularized hidden Markov model for analyzing the 'hot shoe' in football	Marius Ötting	2019-11-19 08:02:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08138v1	Although academic research on the 'hot hand' effect (in particular, in sports, especially in basketball) has been going on for more than 30 years, it still remains a central question in different areas of research whether such an effect exists. In this contribution, we investigate the potential occurrence of a 'hot shoe' effect for the performance of penalty takers in football based on data from the German Bundesliga. For this purpose, we consider hidden Markov models (HMMs) to model the (latent) forms of players. To further account for individual heterogeneity of the penalty taker as well as the opponent's goalkeeper, player-specific abilities are incorporated in the model formulation together with a LASSO penalty. Our results suggest states which can be tied to different forms of players, thus providing evidence for the hot shoe effect, and shed some light on exceptionally well-performing goalkeepers, which are of potential interest to managers and sports fans.			arxiv	['Andreas Groll']	175.0
425	Investigating the efficiency of the Asian handicap football betting market with ratings and Bayesian networks	Anthony Constantinou	2020-03-10 09:50:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09384v2	Despite the massive popularity of the Asian Handicap (AH) football (soccer) betting market, its efficiency has not been adequately studied by the relevant literature. This paper combines rating systems with Bayesian networks and presents the first published model specifically developed for prediction and assessment of the efficiency of the AH betting market. The results are based on 13 English Premier League seasons and are compared to the traditional market, where the bets are for win, lose or draw. Different betting situations have been examined including a) both average and maximum (best available) market odds, b) all possible betting decision thresholds between predicted and published odds, c) optimisations for both return-on-investment and profit, and d) simple stake adjustments to investigate how the variance of returns changes when targeting equivalent profit in both traditional and AH markets. While the AH market is found to share the inefficiencies of the traditional market, the findings reveal both interesting differences as well as similarities between the two.			arxiv	[]	176.0
426	Predicting play calls in the National Football League using hidden Markov models	Marius Ötting	2020-03-24 11:48:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10791v1	In recent years, data-driven approaches have become a popular tool in a variety of sports to gain an advantage by, e.g., analysing potential strategies of opponents. Whereas the availability of play-by-play or player tracking data in sports such as basketball and baseball has led to an increase of sports analytics studies, equivalent datasets for the National Football League (NFL) were not freely available for a long time. In this contribution, we consider a comprehensive play-by-play NFL dataset provided by www.kaggle.com, comprising 289,191 observations in total, to predict play calls in the NFL using hidden Markov models. The resulting out-of-sample prediction accuracy for the 2018 NFL season is 71.5%, which is substantially higher compared to similar studies on play call predictions in the NFL.			arxiv	[]	177.0
427	Asymmetries in football: The pass-goal paradox	D. R. Antequera	2020-05-21 17:50:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10816v1	"We investigate the relation between the number of passes made by a football team and the number of goals. We analyze the 380 matches of a complete season of the Spanish national league ""LaLiga"" (2018/2019). We observe how the number of scored goals is positively correlated with the number of passes made by a team. In this way, teams on the top (bottom) of the ranking at the end of the season make more (less) passes than the rest of the teams. However, we observe a strong asymmetry when the analysis is made depending on the part of the match. Interestingly, fewer passes are made on the second part of a match while, at the same time, more goals are scored. This paradox appears in the majority of teams, and it is independent of the number of passes made. These results confirm that goals in the first part of matches are more ""costly"" in terms of passes than those scored on second halves."			arxiv	['D. Garrido', 'I. Echegoyen', 'R.

The problem is reduced to finding a trajectory of the ball from its current position to the opponents goals. Heuristic search algorithm, i.e. A*, is used to find such a trajectory. For this algorithm to be applicable we introduce a discretized model of the environment, i.e. a graph, as well as the core search components: cost function and heuristic function. Both are designed to take into account all the available information of the game state. We extensively evaluate the suggested approach in simulation comparing it to a range of baselines. The result of the conducted evaluation clearly shows the benefit of utilizing heuristic search within the RoboCup context.			arxiv	['Vladimir Litvinenko', 'Ilya Ryakin', 'Konstantin Yakovlev']	179.0
429	Wisdom of the crowds forecasting the 2018 FIFA Men's World Cup	Marco Henrique de Almeida Inácio	2020-08-29 16:23:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13005v1	The FIFA Men's World Cup Tournament (WCT) is the most important football (soccer) competition, attracting worldwide attention. A popular practice among football fans in Brazil is to organize contests in which each participant informs guesses on the final score of each match. The participants are then ranked according to some scoring rule. Inspired by these contests, we created a website to hold an online contest, in which participants were asked for their probabilities on the outcomes of upcoming matches of the WCT. After each round of the tournament, the ranking of all users based on a proper scoring rule were published. This paper studies the performance of some methods intended to extract the wisdom of the crowds, which are aggregated forecasts that uses some or all of the forecasts available. The later methods are compared to simpler forecasting strategies as well as to statistical prediction models. Our findings corroborate the hypothesis that, at least for sporting events, the wisdom of the crowds offers a competitive forecasting strategy. Specifically, some of these strategies were able to achieve high scores in our contest.			arxiv	['Rafael Izbicki', 'Danilo Lourenço Lopes', 'Luis Ernesto Salasar', 'João Poloniato', 'Marcio Alves Diniz']	180.0

Based on data provided by a major European carrier during mass events in a football stadium comprising up to 30.000 people, 16 base station sectors and $1$Km$^2$ area, we performed a data-driven analysis of the radio access network infrastructure dynamics during such events. Given the insights obtained from the analysis, we developed ARENA, a model-free deep learning Radio Access Network (RAN) capacity forecasting solution that, taking as input past network monitoring data and events context information, provides guidance to mobile operators on the expected RAN capacity needed during a future event. Our results, validated against real events contained in the dataset, illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution.			arxiv	['Vincenzo Sciancalepore', 'Andres Garcia-Saavedra', 'Xavier Costa-Perez', 'Georgios Agapiou', 'Hans D.

We highlight that the package is particularly useful as a data-driven tool for evaluating potential in-game strategies or rule changes within the league.

The use of a feedback mechanism to alert an athlete of a potential hit may mitigate the risk for sport-related concussion and catastrophic injury by allowing athletes to effectively brace for an otherwise unforeseen impact. In this project, we created a proximity sensor system using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to send haptic feedback to the wearer before a potential impact. Our pilot test consisted of three participants who wore our novel sensor system, who ran simulated routes to represent player-to-player contact. Additionally, we used simulated data from a Network Live Football (NFL) league game to further validate our contact prediction algorithm. Results show that our method can predict players' collisions with less than 14% false-alarms.			arxiv	['Fateme Nikseresht', 'Jacob Earl Resch', 'Laura Barnes', 'Mehdi Boukhechba']	184.0

We model the teams' objectives for a season and track how these evolve as games unfold to give a fluent objective that can aid in decision-making games. We develop Markov chain Monte Carlo and deep learning-based algorithms that make use of the fluent objectives in order to learn from prior games and other games in the environment and increase the teams' long-term performance. Simulations of our approach using real-world datasets from 760 matches shows that by using optimised tactics with our fluent objective and prior games, we can on average increase teams mean expected finishing distribution in the league by up to 35.6%.			arxiv	['Georgios Chalkiadakis', 'Timothy J.

435	Flexible marked spatio-temporal point processes with applications to event sequences from association football	Santhosh Narayanan	2021-03-08 10:15:29	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04647v3	We develop a new family of marked point processes by focusing the characteristic properties of marked Hawkes processes exclusively to the space of marks, providing the freedom to specify a different model for the occurrence times. This is possible through the decomposition of the joint distribution of marks and times that allows to separately specify the conditional distribution of marks given the filtration of the process and the current time. We develop a Bayesian framework for the inference and prediction from this family of marked point processes that can naturally accommodate process and point-specific covariate information to drive cross-excitations, offering wide flexibility and applicability in the modelling of real-world processes. The framework is used here for the modelling of in-game event sequences from association football, resulting not only in inferences about previously unquantified characteristics of game dynamics and extraction of event-specific team abilities, but also in predictions for the occurrence of events of interest, such as goals, corners or fouls in a specified interval of time.			arxiv	['Ioannis Kosmidis', 'Petros Dellaportas']	186.0
436	On the dependence in football match outcomes: traditional model assumptions and an alternative proposal	Marco Petretta	2021-03-12 13:47:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07272v2	The approaches routinely used to model the outcomes of football matches are characterised by strong assumptions about the dependence between the number of goals scored by the two competing teams and their marginal distribution. In this work, we argue that the assumptions traditionally made are not always based on solid arguments. Although most of these assumptions have been relaxed in the recent literature, the model introduced by Dixon and Coles in 1997 still represents a point of reference in the betting industry. While maintaining its conceptual simplicity, we propose a modification of the dependence structure. A real data application suggests that our model, named Mar-Co, outperforms the Dixon and Coles one in several betting scenarios, and parameter interpretation provides key insights on league dynamics.			arxiv	['Lorenzo Schiavon', 'Jacopo Diquigiovanni']	187.0
437	Does home advantage without crowd exist in American football?	Dávid Zoltán Szabó	2021-04-22 09:18:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11595v1	It is well-known that home team has an inherent advantage against visiting teams when playing team sports. One of the most obvious underlying reasons, the presence of supporting fans has mostly disappeared in major leagues with the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic. This paper investigates with the help of historical National Football League (NFL) data, how much effect spectators have on the game outcome. Our findings reveal that under no allowance of spectators the home teams' performance is substantially lower than under normal circumstances, even performing slightly worse than the visiting teams. On the other hand, when a limited amount of spectators are allowed to the game, the home teams' performance is no longer significantly different than what we observe with full stadiums. This suggests that from a psychological point of view the effect of crowd support is already induced by a fraction of regular fans.			arxiv	['Diego Andrés Pérez']	188.0

The proposed model allows predictions in terms of probabilities in order to quantify the chances for each team to reach a certain stage of the tournament. We use Monte Carlo simulations for estimating the outcome of each single match of the tournament, from which we are able to simulate the whole tournament itself. The model is fitted on all football games of the participating teams since 2014 weighted by date and importance.			arxiv	[]	189.0
439	More on verification of probability forecasts for football outcomes: score decompositions, reliability, and discrimination analyses	Jean-Louis Foulley	2021-06-28 00:21:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14345v1	Forecast of football outcomes in terms of Home Win, Draw and Away Win relies largely on ex ante probability elicitation of these events and ex post verification of them via computation of probability scoring rules (Brier, Ranked Probability, Logarithmic, Zero-One scores). Usually, appraisal of the quality of forecasting procedures is restricted to reporting mean score values. The purpose of this article is to propose additional tools of verification, such as score decompositions into several components of special interest. Graphical and numerical diagnoses of reliability and discrimination and kindred statistical methods are presented using different techniques of binning (fixed thresholds, quantiles, logistic and iso regression). These procedures are illustrated on probability forecasts for the outcomes of the UEFA Champions League (C1) at the end of the group stage based on typical Poisson regression models with reasonably good results in terms of reliability as compared to those obtained from bookmaker odds and whatever the technique used. Links with research in machine learning and different areas of application (meteorology, medicine) are discussed.			arxiv	[]	190.0

Our adaptation considers the advantage of playing at home when considering the potential of the home and away teams. The algorithm predicts the tournament's outcome by using the market value or/and the ongoing team's performance as initial conditions in the context of Monte Carlo simulations. We present and compare our results to the worldwide known SPI predictions performed by the ""FiveThirtyEight"" project. The results show that the algorithm can deliver good predictions even with a few ingredients and in more complicated seasons like the 2020 editions where the matches were played without fans in the stadiums."			arxiv	['Roberto da Silva', 'Henrique A.

These quantitative facts can empower new applications like automated infographic generation. We formulate part and whole extraction as a sequence tagging problem. Due to the large gap between part/whole and its corresponding percentage, we introduce skip mechanism in sequence modeling, and achieved improved performance on both our task and the CoNLL-2003 named entity recognition task. Experimental results demonstrate that learning to skip in sequence tagging is promising."			arxiv	['Jian-Guang Lou']	192.0

Corner kick taken events are often decisive in the match outcome and inherently arrive in batch with serial clustering pattern. Providing parameter estimates with intuitive interpretation, a class of compound Poisson regression including a Bayesian implementation of geometric-Poisson distribution is introduced. With a varying shape parameter, the corner counts serial correlation between matches is handled naturally within the Bayesian model. In this study, information elicited from cross-market betting odds was used to improve the model predictability.

443	FIFA ranking: Evaluation and path forward	Leszek Szczecinski	2021-12-20 21:08:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00691v1	"In this work we study the ranking algorithm used by F\'ed\'eration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA); we analyze the parameters it currently uses, show the formal probabilistic model from which it can be derived, and optimize the latter. In particular, analyzing the games since the introduction of the algorithm in 2018, we conclude that the game's ""importance"" (as defined by FIFA) used in the algorithm is counterproductive from the point of view of the predictive capability of the algorithm. We also postulate the algorithm to be rooted in the formal modelling principle, where the Davidson model proposed in 1970 seems to be an excellent candidate, preserving the form of the algorithm currently used. The results indicate that the predictive capability of the algorithm is notably improved by using the home-field advantage and the explicit model for the draws in the game. Moderate, but notable improvement may be attained by introducing the weighting of the results with the goal differential, which although not rooted in a formal modelling principle, is compatible with the current algorithm and can be tuned to the characteristics of the football competition."			arxiv	['Iris-Ioana Roatis']	194.0
444	Distances for Comparing Multisets and Sequences	George Bolt	2022-06-17 15:59:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08858v1	Measuring the distance between data points is fundamental to many statistical techniques, such as dimension reduction or clustering algorithms. However, improvements in data collection technologies has led to a growing versatility of structured data for which standard distance measures are inapplicable. In this paper, we consider the problem of measuring the distance between sequences and multisets of points lying within a metric space, motivated by the analysis of an in-play football data set. Drawing on the wider literature, including that of time series analysis and optimal transport, we discuss various distances which are available in such an instance. For each distance, we state and prove theoretical properties, proposing possible extensions where they fail. Finally, via an example analysis of the in-play football data, we illustrate the usefulness of these distances in practice.			arxiv	['Simón Lunagómez', 'Christopher Nemeth']	195.0
445	Prediction of Football Player Value using Bayesian Ensemble Approach	Hansoo Lee	2022-06-24 07:13:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13246v1	The transfer fees of sports players have become astronomical. This is because bringing players of great future value to the club is essential for their survival. We present a case study on the key factors affecting the world's top soccer players' transfer fees based on the FIFA data analysis. To predict each player's market value, we propose an improved LightGBM model by optimizing its hyperparameter using a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm. We identify prominent features by the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm. The proposed method has been compared against the baseline regression models (e.g., linear regression, lasso, elastic net, kernel ridge regression) and gradient boosting model without hyperparameter optimization. The optimized LightGBM model showed an excellent accuracy of approximately 3.8, 1.4, and 1.8 times on average compared to the regression baseline models, GBDT, and LightGBM model in terms of RMSE. Our model offers interpretability in deciding what attributes football clubs should consider in recruiting players in the future.			arxiv	['Bayu Adhi Tama', 'Meeyoung Cha']	196.0
446	Complexity emerges in measures of the marking dynamics in football games	A. Chacoma	2022-07-20 15:51:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09992v2	In this article, we study the dynamics of marking in football matches. To do this, we surveyed and analyzed a database containing the trajectories of players from both teams on the field of play during three professional games. We describe the dynamics through the construction of temporal bipartite networks of proximity. Based on the introduced concept of proximity, the nodes are the players, and the links are defined between opponents that are close enough to each other at a given moment. By studying the evolution of the heterogeneity parameter of the networks during the game, we characterized a scaling law for the average shape of the fluctuations, unveiling the emergence of complexity in the system. Moreover, we proposed a simple model to simulate the players' motion in the field from where we obtained the evolution of a synthetic proximity network. We show that the model captures with a remarkable agreement the complexity of the empirical case, hence it proves to be helpful to elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed phenomena.			arxiv	['M.

447	Predicting Football Match Outcomes with eXplainable Machine Learning and the Kelly Index	Yiming Ren	2022-11-28 19:32:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15734v1	In this work, a machine learning approach is developed for predicting the outcomes of football matches. The novelty of this research lies in the utilisation of the Kelly Index to first classify matches into categories where each one denotes the different levels of predictive difficulty. Classification models using a wide suite of algorithms were developed for each category of matches in order to determine the efficacy of the approach. In conjunction to this, a set of previously unexplored features were engineering including Elo-based variables. The dataset originated from the Premier League match data covering the 2019-2021 seasons. The findings indicate that the process of decomposing the predictive problem into sub-tasks was effective and produced competitive results with prior works, while the ensemble-based methods were the most effective. The paper also devised an investment strategy in order to evaluate its effectiveness by benchmarking against bookmaker odds. An approach was developed that minimises risk by combining the Kelly Index with the predefined confidence thresholds of the predictive models. The experiments found that the proposed strategy can return a profit when following a conservative approach that focuses primarily on easy-to-predict matches where the predictive models display a high confidence level.			arxiv	['Teo Susnjak']	198.0
448	Event Detection in Football using Graph Convolutional Networks	Aditya Sangram Singh Rana	2023-01-24 14:52:54	http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10052v1	The massive growth of data collection in sports has opened numerous avenues for professional teams and media houses to gain insights from this data. The data collected includes per frame player and ball trajectories, and event annotations such as passes, fouls, cards, goals, etc. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have recently been employed to process this highly unstructured tracking data which can be otherwise difficult to model because of lack of clarity on how to order players in a sequence and how to handle missing objects of interest. In this thesis, we focus on the goal of automatic event detection from football videos. We show how to model the players and the ball in each frame of the video sequence as a graph, and present the results for graph convolutional layers and pooling methods that can be used to model the temporal context present around each action.			arxiv	[]	199.0
449	A Continuous-Time Stochastic Process for High-Resolution Network Data in Sports	Nicholas Grieshop	2023-03-02 14:49:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01318v1	Technological advances have paved the way for collecting high-resolution tracking data in basketball, football, and other team-based sports. Such data consist of interactions among players of competing teams indexed by space and time. High-resolution tracking data on interactions among players are vital to understanding and predicting the performance of teams, because the performance of a team is more than the sum of the strengths of its individual players. We introduce a continuous-time stochastic process as a model of interactions among players of competing teams indexed by space and time, discuss properties of the continuous-time stochastic process, and learn the stochastic process from high-resolution tracking data by pursuing a Bayesian approach. We present an application to Juventus Turin, Inter Milan, and other Italian football clubs.			arxiv	['Yong Feng', 'Guanyu Hu', 'Michael Schweinberger']	200.0
450	Diversity is Strength: Mastering Football Full Game with Interactive Reinforcement Learning of Multiple AIs	Chenglu Sun	2023-06-28 03:56:57	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15903v1	Training AI with strong and rich strategies in multi-agent environments remains an important research topic in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The AI's strength is closely related to its diversity of strategies, and this relationship can guide us to train AI with both strong and rich strategies. To prove this point, we propose Diversity is Strength (DIS), a novel DRL training framework that can simultaneously train multiple kinds of AIs. These AIs are linked through an interconnected history model pool structure, which enhances their capabilities and strategy diversities. We also design a model evaluation and screening scheme to select the best models to enrich the model pool and obtain the final AI. The proposed training method provides diverse, generalizable, and strong AI strategies without using human data. We tested our method in an AI competition based on Google Research Football (GRF) and won the 5v5 and 11v11 tracks. The method enables a GRF AI to have a high level on both 5v5 and 11v11 tracks for the first time, which are under complex multi-agent environments. The behavior analysis shows that the trained AI has rich strategies, and the ablation experiments proved that the designed modules benefit the training process.			arxiv	['Shuo Shen', 'Sijia Xu', 'Weidong Zhang']	201.0
451	Visitors Out! The Absence of Away Team Supporters as a Source of Home Advantage in Football	Federico Fioravanti	2023-08-03 13:22:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06279v2	We seek to gain more insight into the effect of the crowds on the Home Advantage by analyzing the particular case of Argentinean football (also known as soccer), where for more than ten years, the visiting team fans were not allowed to attend the games. Additionally, during the COVID-19 lockdown, a significant number of games were played without both away and home team fans. The analysis of more than 20 years of matches of the Argentinean tournament indicates that the absence of the away team crowds was beneficial for the Top 5 teams during the first two years after their attendance was forbidden. An additional intriguing finding is that the lack of both crowds affects significantly all the teams, to the point of turning the home advantage into home `disadvantage' for most of the teams.			arxiv	['Fernando Delbianco', 'Fernando Tohmé']	202.0
452	Passing Heatmap Prediction Based on Transformer Model and Tracking Data	Yisheng Pei	2023-09-04 11:14:22	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01526v1	Although the data-driven analysis of football players' performance has been developed for years, most research only focuses on the on-ball event including shots and passes, while the off-ball movement remains a little-explored area in this domain. Players' contributions to the whole match are evaluated unfairly, those who have more chances to score goals earn more credit than others, while the indirect and unnoticeable impact that comes from continuous movement has been ignored. This research presents a novel deep-learning network architecture which is capable to predict the potential end location of passes and how players' movement before the pass affects the final outcome. Once analysed more than 28,000 pass events, a robust prediction can be achieved with more than 0.7 Top-1 accuracy. And based on the prediction, a better understanding of the pitch control and pass option could be reached to measure players' off-ball movement contribution to defensive performance. Moreover, this model could provide football analysts a better tool and metric to understand how players' movement over time contributes to the game strategy and final victory.			arxiv	['Varuna De Silva', 'Mike Caine']	203.0
453	Analytics, have some humility: a statistical view of fourth-down decision making	Ryan S. Brill	2023-11-06 20:00:16	http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03490v3	The standard mathematical approach to fourth-down decision making in American football is to make the decision that maximizes estimated win probability. Win probability estimates arise from machine learning models fit from historical data. These models, however, are overfit high-variance estimators, exacerbated by the highly correlated nature of football play-by-play data. We develop a machine learning framework that accounts for this auto-correlation and knits uncertainty quantification into our decision making. In particular, we recommend a fourth-down decision when we are confident it has higher win probability than all other decisions. Our final product is a major advance in fourth-down strategic decision making: far fewer fourth-down decisions are as obvious as analysts claim.			arxiv	['Ronald Yurko', 'Abraham J. Wyner']	204.0

The code of the methods and metrics are provided so that they can be used as a benchmark in future comparisons. The recent YOLO8n model proves better than FootAndBall in long-shot real-time detection of the ball and players on football fields.			arxiv	['Ilias Maglogiannis']	205.0
455	From Motor Control to Team Play in Simulated Humanoid Football	Siqi Liu	2021-05-25 20:17:10	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12196v1	Intelligent behaviour in the physical world exhibits structure at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Although movements are ultimately executed at the level of instantaneous muscle tensions or joint torques, they must be selected to serve goals defined on much longer timescales, and in terms of relations that extend far beyond the body itself, ultimately involving coordination with other agents. Recent research in artificial intelligence has shown the promise of learning-based approaches to the respective problems of complex movement, longer-term planning and multi-agent coordination. However, there is limited research aimed at their integration. We study this problem by training teams of physically simulated humanoid avatars to play football in a realistic virtual environment. We develop a method that combines imitation learning, single- and multi-agent reinforcement learning and population-based training, and makes use of transferable representations of behaviour for decision making at different levels of abstraction. In a sequence of stages, players first learn to control a fully articulated body to perform realistic, human-like movements such as running and turning; they then acquire mid-level football skills such as dribbling and shooting; finally, they develop awareness of others and play as a team, bridging the gap between low-level motor control at a timescale of milliseconds, and coordinated goal-directed behaviour as a team at the timescale of tens of seconds. We investigate the emergence of behaviours at different levels of abstraction, as well as the representations that underlie these behaviours using several analysis techniques, including statistics from real-world sports analytics. Our work constitutes a complete demonstration of integrated decision-making at multiple scales in a physically embodied multi-agent setting.

Here we show that if a phase transition occurs on a flat brane, so as to change its tension, then the brane will not remain flat. In other words, there is really no self-tuning in such models, which can in fact be understood in four-dimensional terms and are therefore subject to Weinberg's no-go theorem.			arxiv	['Massimo Porrati']	209.0

As a result, we present who were the best players and how their performance evolved, define volatility metrics to measure a player's consistency, and build a player development curve to assist decision-making.			arxiv	['Luís Meireles', 'João Mendes-Moreira']	227.0

We prove that any compact Riemann surface with a CSC-1 reducible conformal metric of finite conical singularities can be divided into a finite number of pieces by cutting along geodesics where each piece is isometric to some football. This allows us to study the existence of CSC-1 reducible conformal metrics with finite conical singularities on a compact Riemann surface. As an application, we give an angle condition of the existence of CSC-1 reducible conformal metrics with finite conical singularities on a compact Riemann surface.			arxiv	['Yingyi Wu', 'Bin Xu']	228.0

With 32 countries and over 800 players representing nearly 300 clubs globally, it measured up to more than 12 billion EUR in the players' current estimated market value total. In this short piece, we explore what the small and interconnected world of football stars looks like and even make a few efforts and compare success in soccer to social networks.			arxiv	['Patrik Szigeti']	229.0

Depending on the game plan & philosophy; some teams prefer to play long balls from either wings or defense. Others, prefer to penetrate in depth with passes and outplay the opponent players. To objectively & in an automated way evaluate how teams play penetrative passes compared to the number of times they had the potential to do so, the ""Potential Penetrative Pass (P3)"" concept is presented here."			arxiv	[]	230.0

With ongoing discussions about attaining a model with such functionality, we present supporting evidence regarding the feasibility of such models. We evaluated our models on multiple datasets, including Twitter Sentiment, Football Commentary, Project Gutenberg, PubMedQA, and SQuAD, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced detection approaches. These datasets were sampled with intricate constraints encompassing every possibility, laying the foundation for future research. We evaluate GPT-3.5-Turbo against various detectors such as SVM, RoBERTa-base, and RoBERTa-large. Based on the research findings, the results predominantly relied on the sequence length of the sentence.			arxiv	['Ashish Bhagchandani', 'Harsh Oza']	231.0

This Named Entity (NE) can be a named: location, person, organization, date, time, etc., characterized by instances. A NE is found in texts accompanied by contexts: words that are left or right of the NE. The work mainly aims at identifying contexts inducing the NE's nature. As such, The occurrence of the word ""President"" in a text, means that this word or context may be followed by the name of a president as President ""Obama"". Likewise, a word preceded by the string ""footballer"" induces that this is the name of a footballer. NE recognition may be viewed as a classification method, where every word is assigned to a NE class, regarding the context. The aim of this study is then to identify and classify the contexts that are most relevant to recognize a NE, those which are frequently found with the NE. A learning approach using training corpus: web documents, constructed from learning examples is then suggested. Frequency representations and modified tf-idf representations are used to calculate the context weights associated to context frequency, learning example frequency, and document frequency in the corpus."			arxiv	[]	232.0
482	Anticipating Activity in Social Media Spikes	Desmond J. Higham	2014-06-08 19:33:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2017v1	We propose a novel mathematical model for the activity of microbloggers during an external, event-driven spike. The model leads to a testable prediction of who would become most active if a spike were to take place. This type of information is of great interest to commercial organisations, governments and charities, as it identifies key players who can be targeted with information in real time when the network is most receptive. The model takes account of the fact that dynamic interactions evolve over an underlying, static network that records who listens to whom. The model is based on the assumption that, in the case where the entire community has become aware of an external news event, a key driver of activity is the motivation to participate by responding to incoming messages. We test the model on a large scale Twitter conversation concerning the appointment of a UK Premier League football club manager. We also present further results for a Bundesliga football match, a marketing event and a television programme. In each case we find that exploiting the underlying connectivity structure improves the prediction of who will be active during a spike. We also show how the half-life of a spike in activity can be quantified in terms of the network size and the typical response rate.			arxiv	['Peter Grindrod', 'Alexander V.

Eric Eager	2015-06-09 21:09:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03104v1	On Monday January 19, 2015 a story broke that the National Football League (NFL) had started an investigation into whether the New England Patriots deliberately deflated the footballs they used during their championship win over the Indianapolis Colts. Like an infectious disease, discussion regarding Deflategate grew rapidly on social media sites in the hours and days after the release of the story. However, after the Super Bowl was over, the scandal slowly began to dissipate and lost much of the attention it had originally had, as interest in the NFL wained at the completion of its season. We construct a simple epidemic model for the infectiousness of the Deflategate news story. We then use data from the social media site Twitter to estimate the parameters of this model using standard techniques from the study of inverse problems. We find that the infectiousness (as measured by the basic reproduction number) of Deflategate rivals that of any infectious disease that we are aware of, and is actually more infectious than recent news stories of greater importance - both in terms of the basic reproduction number and in terms of the average amount of time the average tweeter continued to tweet about the news story.			arxiv	['Megan Eberle', 'James Peirce']	234.0
484	The football {5, 6, 6} and its geometries: from a sport tool to fullerens and further	Emil Molnár	2017-03-07 08:10:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02264v1	This presentation starts with the regular polygons, of course, then with the Platonic and Archimedean solids. The latter ones are whose symmetry groups are transitive on the vertices, and in addition, whose faces are regular polygons (see only I. Prok's home page [11] for them). Then there come these symmetry groups themselves (starting with the cube and octahedron, of course, then icosahedron and dodecahedron). Then come the space filling properties: Namely the cube is a space filler for the Euclidean space E^3. Then we jump for the other regular solids that cannot fil E^3, but can hyperbolic space H^3, a new space. These can be understood better if we start regular polygons, of course, that cannot fil E^2 in general, but can fil the new plane H2, as hyperbolic or Bolyai-Lobachevsky plane. Now it raises the problem, whether a football polyhedron - with its congruent copies - fil a space. It turns out that E^3 is excluded (it remains an open problem - for you, of course, in other aspects), but H^3 can be filled as a schematic construction show this (Fig. 5), far from elementary. Then we mention some stories on Buckminster Fuller, an architect, who imagined first time fullerens as such crystal structures. Many problems remain open, of course, we are just in the middle of living science.			arxiv	['István Prok', 'Jenő Szirmai']	235.0
485	A Probabilistic Model for Predicting Shot Success in Football	Edward Wheatcroft	2021-01-06 15:51:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02104v1	Football forecasting models traditionally rate teams on past match results, that is based on the number of goals scored. Goals, however, involve a high element of chance and thus past results often do not reflect the performances of the teams. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that accounting for other match events such as shots at goal can provide a better indication of the relative strengths of two teams than the number of goals scored. Forecast models based on this information have been shown to be successful in outperforming those based purely on match results. A notable weakness, however, is that this approach does not take into account differences in the probability of shot success among teams. A team that is more likely to score from a shot will need fewer shots to win a match, on average. In this paper, we propose a simple parametric model to predict the probability of a team scoring, given it has taken a shot at goal. We show that the resulting forecasts are able to outperform a model assuming an equal probability of shot success among all teams. We then show that the model can be combined with predictions of the number of shots achieved by each team, and can increase the skill of forecasts of both the match outcome and of whether the total number of goals in a match will exceed 2.5. We assess the performance of the forecasts alongside two betting strategies and find mixed evidence for improved performance.			arxiv	['Ewelina Sienkiewicz']	236.0
486	The Probabilistic Final Standing Calculator: a fair stochastic tool to handle abruptly stopped football seasons	Hans Van Eetvelde	2021-01-26 07:14:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10597v1	The COVID-19 pandemic has left its marks in the sports world, forcing the full-stop of all sports-related activities in the first half of 2020. Football leagues were suddenly stopped and each country was hesitating between a relaunch of the competition and a premature ending. Some opted for the latter option, and took as the final standing of the season the ranking from the moment the competition got interrupted. This decision has been perceived as unfair, especially by those teams who had remaining matches against easier opponents. In this paper, we introduce a tool to calculate in a fairer way the final standings of domestic leagues that have to stop prematurely: our Probabilistic Final Standing Calculator (PFSC). It is based on a stochastic model taking into account the results of the matches played and simulating the remaining matches, yielding the probabilities for the various possible final rankings. We have compared our PFSC with state-of-the-art prediction models, using previous seasons which we pretend to stop at different points in time. We illustrate our PFSC by showing how a probabilistic ranking of the French Ligue 1 in the stopped 2019-2020 season could have led to alternative, potentially fairer, decisions on the final standing.			arxiv	['Lars Magnus Hvattum', 'Christophe Ley']	237.0
487	Beating the bookies with their own numbers - and how the online sports betting market is rigged	Lisandro Kaunitz	2017-10-08 11:44:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02824v2	The online sports gambling industry employs teams of data analysts to build forecast models that turn the odds at sports games in their favour. While several betting strategies have been proposed to beat bookmakers, from expert prediction models and arbitrage strategies to odds bias exploitation, their returns have been inconsistent and it remains to be shown that a betting strategy can outperform the online sports betting market. We designed a strategy to beat football bookmakers with their own numbers. Instead of building a forecasting model to compete with bookmakers predictions, we exploited the probability information implicit in the odds publicly available in the marketplace to find bets with mispriced odds. Our strategy proved profitable in a 10-year historical simulation using closing odds, a 6-month historical simulation using minute to minute odds, and a 5-month period during which we staked real money with the bookmakers (we made code, data and models publicly available). Our results demonstrate that the football betting market is inefficient - bookmakers can be consistently beaten across thousands of games in both simulated environments and real-life betting. We provide a detailed description of our betting experience to illustrate how the sports gambling industry compensates these market inefficiencies with discriminatory practices against successful clients.			arxiv	['Shenjun Zhong', 'Javier Kreiner']	238.0

In the case of a football field, the area to cover is large, thus several regular cameras should be used, which makes the setup expensive and complex. As an alternative, we developed a system that detects players from a unique cheap and wide-angle fisheye camera assisted by a single narrow-angle thermal camera. In this work, we train a network in a knowledge distillation approach in which the student and the teacher have different modalities and a different view of the same scene. In particular, we design a custom data augmentation combined with a motion detection algorithm to handle the training in the region of the fisheye camera not covered by the thermal one. We show that our solution is effective in detecting players on the whole field filmed by the fisheye camera. We evaluate it quantitatively and qualitatively in the case of an online distillation, where the student detects players in real time while being continuously adapted to the latest video conditions.			arxiv	['Adrien Deliège', 'Noor Ul Huda', 'Rikke Gade', 'Marc Van Droogenbroeck', 'Thomas B.

To accomplish that, this study develops an integrative theoretical model of team performance to explain HA based on prior literature, pushing its limits to unfold the manager role in such a persistent pattern of performance in soccer. Data on one decade of the national tournament of Brazil was obtained from public sources, including information about matches and coaches of all 12 teams who played these competitions. Our conceptual modeling allows an empirical analysis of HA and performance that covers the effects of tactics, presence of supporters in matches and team fatigue via logistic regression. The results confirm the HA in the elite division of Brazilian soccer across all levels of comparative technical quality, a new variable introduced to control for a potential technical gap between teams (something that would turn the managerial influence null). Further analysis provides evidence that highlights managerial capacity to block the HA effect above and beyond the influences of fatigue (distance traveled) and density of people in the matches. This is the case of coaches Abel Braga, Marcelo Fernandes and Roger Machado, who were capable to reverse HA when playing against teams of similar quality. Overall, the home advantage diminishes as the comparative quality increases but disappears only when the two teams are of extremely different technical quality.			arxiv	['Jessica Alves']	240.0
490	Improving state estimation through projection post-processing for activity recognition with application to football	Michał Ciszewski	2021-02-05 17:32:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03310v4	The past decade has seen an increased interest in human activity recognition based on sensor data. Most often, the sensor data come unannotated, creating the need for fast labelling methods. For assessing the quality of the labelling, an appropriate performance measure has to be chosen. Our main contribution is a novel post-processing method for activity recognition. It improves the accuracy of the classification methods by correcting for unrealistic short activities in the estimate. We also propose a new performance measure, the Locally Time-Shifted Measure (LTS measure), which addresses uncertainty in the times of state changes. The effectiveness of the post-processing method is evaluated, using the novel LTS measure, on the basis of a simulated dataset and a real application on sensor data from football. The simulation study is also used to discuss the choice of the parameters of the post-processing method and the LTS measure.			arxiv	['Jakob Söhl', 'Geurt Jongbloed']	241.0
491	Time Window of Head Impact Kinematics Measurement for Calculation of Brain Strain and Strain Rate in American Football	Yuzhe Liu	2021-02-10 20:33:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05728v1	Wearable devices have been shown to effectively measure the head movement during impacts in sports like American football. When a head impact occurs, the device is triggered to collect and save the kinematic measurements during a predefined time window. Then, based on the collected kinematics, finite element (FE) head models can calculate brain strain, which is used to evaluate the risk of mild traumatic brain injury. To find a time window that can provide a sufficient duration of kinematics for FE analysis, we investigated 118 on-field video-confirmed head impacts collected by the Stanford Instrumented Mouthguard. Because the individual differences in brain geometry influence these calculations, we included six representative brain geometries and found that larger brains need a longer time window of kinematics for accurate calculation. Among the different sizes of brains, a pre-trigger time of 20 ms and a post-trigger time of 70 ms were found to yield calculations of brain strain and strain rate that were not significantly different from calculations using the original 200 ms time window recorded by the mouthguard.			arxiv	['August G.

Indeed, without shaped rewards, i.e., with only terminal rewards, present-day Embodied AI results degrade significantly across Embodied AI problems from single-agent Habitat-based PointGoal Navigation (SPL drops from 55 to 0) and two-agent AI2-THOR-based Furniture Moving (success drops from 58% to 1%) to three-agent Google Football-based 3 vs. 1 with Keeper (game score drops from 0.6 to 0.1). As training from shaped rewards doesn't scale to more realistic tasks, the community needs to improve the success of training with terminal rewards. For this we propose GridToPix: 1) train agents with terminal rewards in gridworlds that generically mirror Embodied AI environments, i.e., they are independent of the task; 2) distill the learned policy into agents that reside in complex visual worlds. Despite learning from only terminal rewards with identical models and RL algorithms, GridToPix significantly improves results across tasks: from PointGoal Navigation (SPL improves from 0 to 64) and Furniture Moving (success improves from 1% to 25%) to football gameplay (game score improves from 0.1 to 0.6). GridToPix even helps to improve the results of shaped reward training.			arxiv	['Iou-Jen Liu', 'Svetlana Lazebnik', 'Aniruddha Kembhavi', 'Luca Weihs', 'Alexander Schwing']	243.0

Namely an ability estimate for every team based on historic matches; an ability estimate for every team based on bookmaker consensus; average plus-minus player ratings based on their individual performances in their home clubs and national teams; and further team covariates (e.g., market value, team structure) and country-specific socio-economic factors (population, GDP). The proposed combined approach is used for learning the number of goals scored in the matches from the four previous UEFA EUROs 2004-2016 and then applied to current information to forecast the upcoming UEFA EURO 2020. Based on the resulting estimates, the tournament is simulated repeatedly and winning probabilities are obtained for all teams. A random forest model favors the current World Champion France with a winning probability of 14.8% before England (13.5%) and Spain (12.3%). Additionally, we provide survival probabilities for all teams and at all tournament stages.			arxiv	['Lars Magnus Hvattum', 'Christophe Ley', 'Franziska Popp', 'Gunther Schauberger', 'Hans Van Eetvelde', 'Achim Zeileis']	244.0
494	Kinematics clustering enables head impact subtyping for better traumatic brain injury prediction	Xianghao Zhan	2021-08-07 18:31:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03498v1	Traumatic brain injury can be caused by various types of head impacts. However, due to different kinematic characteristics, many brain injury risk estimation models are not generalizable across the variety of impacts that humans may sustain. The current definitions of head impact subtypes are based on impact sources (e.g., football, traffic accident), which may not reflect the intrinsic kinematic similarities of impacts across the impact sources. To investigate the potential new definitions of impact subtypes based on kinematics, 3,161 head impacts from various sources including simulation, college football, mixed martial arts, and car racing were collected. We applied the K-means clustering to cluster the impacts on 16 standardized temporal features from head rotation kinematics. Then, we developed subtype-specific ridge regression models for cumulative strain damage (using the threshold of 15%), which significantly improved the estimation accuracy compared with the baseline method which mixed impacts from different sources and developed one model (R^2 from 0.7 to 0.9). To investigate the effect of kinematic features, we presented the top three critical features (maximum resultant angular acceleration, maximum angular acceleration along the z-axis, maximum linear acceleration along the y-axis) based on regression accuracy and used logistic regression to find the critical points for each feature that partitioned the subtypes. This study enables researchers to define head impact subtypes in a data-driven manner, which leads to more generalizable brain injury risk estimation.			arxiv	['Yiheng Li', 'Yuzhe Liu', 'Nicholas J.

Distance metrics can only serve as proxy for similarity in information retrieval of similar instances. Learning a good similarity function from human annotations improves the quality of retrievals. This work uses deep metric learning to learn these user-defined similarity functions from few annotations for a large football trajectory dataset. We adapt an entropy-based active learning method with recent work from triplet mining to collect easy-to-answer but still informative annotations from human participants and use them to train a deep convolutional network that generalizes to unseen samples. Our user study shows that our approach improves the quality of the information retrieval compared to a previous deep metric learning approach that relies on a Siamese network. Specifically, we shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of passive sampling heuristics and active learners alike by analyzing the participants' response efficacy. To this end, we collect accuracy, algorithmic time complexity, the participants' fatigue and time-to-response, qualitative self-assessment and statements, as well as the effects of mixed-expertise annotators and their consistency on model performance and transfer-learning.			arxiv	['Kion Fallah', 'Stefano Fenu', 'Dario Zanca', 'Bjoern Eskofier', 'Christopher John Rozell', 'Christopher Mutschler']	246.0
496	Crediting football players for creating dangerous actions in an unbiased way: the generation of threat (GoT) indices	Ali Baouan	2023-04-11 14:27:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05242v1	We introduce an innovative methodology to identify football players at the origin of threatening actions in a team. In our framework, a threat is defined as entering the opposing team's danger area. We investigate the timing of threat events and ball touches of players, and capture their correlation using Hawkes processes. Our model-based approach allows us to evaluate a player's ability to create danger both directly and through interactions with teammates. We define a new index, called Generation of Threat (GoT), that measures in an unbiased way the contribution of a player to threat generation. For illustration, we present a detailed analysis of Chelsea's 2016-2017 season, with a standout performance from Eden Hazard. We are able to credit each player for his involvement in danger creation and determine the main circuits leading to threat. In the same spirit, we investigate the danger generation process of Stade Rennais in the 2021-2022 season. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive ranking of Ligue 1 players based on their generated threat in the 2021-2022 season. Our analysis reveals surprising results, with players such as Jason Berthomier, Moses Simon and Frederic Guilbert among the top performers in the GoT rankings. We also present a ranking of Ligue 1 central defenders in terms of generation of threat and confirm the great performance of some center-back pairs, such as Nayef Aguerd and Warmed Omari.			arxiv	['Sébastien Coustou', 'Mathieu Lacome', 'Sergio Pulido', 'Mathieu Rosenbaum']	247.0

To guarantee that the opponents of the clubs are of the same strength in the new design, it is crucial to forecast the performance of the teams before the tournament as well as possible. This paper investigates whether the currently used rating of the teams, the UEFA club coefficient, can be improved by taking the games played in the national leagues into account. According to our logistic regression models, a variant of the Elo method provides a higher accuracy in terms of explanatory power in the Champions League matches. The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) is encouraged to follow the example of the FIFA World Ranking and reform the calculation of the club coefficients in order to avoid unbalanced schedules in the novel tournament format of the Champions League.			arxiv	[]	248.0
498	Toward more accurate and generalizable brain deformation estimators for traumatic brain injury detection with unsupervised domain adaptation	Xianghao Zhan	2023-06-08 14:52:56	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05255v1	Machine learning head models (MLHMs) are developed to estimate brain deformation for early detection of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the overfitting to simulated impacts and the lack of generalizability caused by distributional shift of different head impact datasets hinders the broad clinical applications of current MLHMs. We propose brain deformation estimators that integrates unsupervised domain adaptation with a deep neural network to predict whole-brain maximum principal strain (MPS) and MPS rate (MPSR). With 12,780 simulated head impacts, we performed unsupervised domain adaptation on on-field head impacts from 302 college football (CF) impacts and 457 mixed martial arts (MMA) impacts using domain regularized component analysis (DRCA) and cycle-GAN-based methods. The new model improved the MPS/MPSR estimation accuracy, with the DRCA method significantly outperforming other domain adaptation methods in prediction accuracy (p<0.001): MPS RMSE: 0.027 (CF) and 0.037 (MMA); MPSR RMSE: 7.159 (CF) and 13.022 (MMA). On another two hold-out test sets with 195 college football impacts and 260 boxing impacts, the DRCA model significantly outperformed the baseline model without domain adaptation in MPS and MPSR estimation accuracy (p<0.001). The DRCA domain adaptation reduces the MPS/MPSR estimation error to be well below TBI thresholds, enabling accurate brain deformation estimation to detect TBI in future clinical applications.			arxiv	['Jiawei Sun', 'Yuzhe Liu', 'Nicholas J.

Thanks to the Cheltsov--Rubinstein classification, this amounts to considering 10 families. In 8 families the problem has been solved by work of Cheltsov--Rubinstein, Fujita and Mazzeo--Rubinstein. The remaining 2 families are rational surfaces parameterized by the self-intersection of the 0-section $n$ and the number of blow-ups $m$. By Cheltsov--Rubinstein, Cheltsov--Rubinstein--Zhang and Fujita, K\""ahler--Einstein edge metrics exist when either $m=0$ or $m\geq3$ for the first family, and the cases $m=1,2$ have been studied by Fujita--Liu--S\""uss--Zhang--Zhuang and Fujita. The final remaining family, denoted $\mathrm{(II.6A.n.m)}$ in the Cheltsov--Rubinstein classification, is more difficult as the boundary consists of two components, unlike any of the other 9 families. It is the generalization of the football to complex surfaces with the pair $\mathrm{(II.6A.0.0)}$ being exactly the football times $\mathbb{P}^1$. The pairs $\mathrm{(II.6A.n.0)}$ have been completely understood by the work of Rubinstein--Zhang using the $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundle structure of Hirzebruch surfaces. This article studies the family $\mathrm{(II.6A.n.m)}$ for $m\geq1$. These pairs no longer have a $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundle structure and are therefore more difficult to tackle. The main result is a necessary and sufficient condition on the angles for the existence of K\""ahler--Einstein edge metrics, generalizing the Rubinstein--Zhang condition. Thus, we resolve the Cheltsov--Rubinstein problem for strongly asymptotically log del Pezzo surfaces."			arxiv	[]	250.0

505	European Derby Rival Matches with a good chance of getting tickets as foreigner	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-06 13:06:56	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18c3le9/european_derby_rival_matches_with_a_good_chance/	Hi All! I know there have been a few post about best derby matches, best fans, best stadium atmospheres and also a plethora of threads for buying tickets to the Prem/La Liga/Eredivisie/Seria A/Bundesliga/SuperLiga/Super League etc but I am losing my mind a little bit. I'm from the UK and the Mrs loves football (I'm lucky, I guess) as does my brother in law and as a Christmas present I would like to take us away to catch a match, with an amazing atmosphere, and preferably a derby. In practice, I would really need to be able to get tickets well in advance to offer them up as a Christmas present and also to be able to plan, book flights/hotel etc. From my initial research it looks like the Intercontinental Derby or any of the big rivalries in Istanbul is off the cards due to the passos system; major Bundesliga teams are impossible; same for any major league derby; same for this team and that league and I'm starting to pull my hair out. At every stage, and at every club, I seem to hit a hurdle either with tickets being basically gold dust / (rightly) reserved for club members / extortionate and not guaranteed on sites like viagogo / or I need to give up my UK citizenship, get the teams tattoo on my face, and join a ten year waiting list just to have a chance to meet a scalper in a dark alley on the night of the match where I may or not get scammed. I'm really hoping for some recommendations of great matches to go to, where I could get tickets (fairly) easily as a foreigner, and that I can get in advance and without needing to take out a mortgage to get them! Can be any team, in any league in Europe. PS The Eternal Derby would have been an amazing option as it seems like I might have been able to get tickets at a reasonable price for that one, but the other half is away when they play in March.	6.0	t3_18c3le9	reddit

I like the guy, im glad we got him, but the fanbase acts like he is god's gift, can afford to make any mistake and hes generational. Generational for me applies to literally fucking once in a generation players who will define a generation. some generational players who play his position in the past. Iniesta, Xavi, Modric. I wouldnt even call Fabregas a generational player, and Cesc was better than enzo at every single attribute there is. Enzo has brilliant passing range and decent level of press resistance but that is literally all he has. His final ball is good but not great, Hes not more press resistant than the upper echelon of players at his position, probably not even top 20 there. Does not have good crossing or set piece delivery, only can carry the ball short spaces, not particularly talented at ball carrying or dribbling in general, and pretty much as zero aptitude for defensive work, absolutely horrible there. His ceiling is probably Thiago Alcantara but I still think Thiago in his prime was better than Enzo will ever be. Imo the team should build around him and hes a good player for sure with an exceptional passing range but generational is way too much for him.	103.0	t3_18asepu	reddit

Joao wasn't lying when he said most players would prefer to touch the ball 50 times than 10 times. Just compare today's game between Barca and Atletico.

Our league is played with 38 matches like the Premier League. So, Botafogo started winning everything, they made the best campaing in history during the first 19 games, they had 47 points, with 15 wins and only 2 losses. During this run, they won all their 10 home games, conceding only 3 goals. And by the end of this 19 games they were 13 points clear from Grêmio, the second place. But in the middle of the league, Al Nassr, the team where Cristiano Ronaldo plays, made an offer to have Botafogo's coach and he accept. Botafogo then get a new manager but things don't go well, and the players make a pressure to get him fired and keep a guy who was already in the club. Then, they lost a derby to Flamengo and lost to Atlético Mineiro, the difference fell a little but they won two more games and drew another one. Then they faced Athletico Paranaense home on a Sunday and would face Fortaleza on a Tuesday, but the game against Athletico needed to be finished on Monday because the lights went out during the game, which led to the game against Fortaleza to be postponed. This was a bad thing because on that week Fortaleza would play the Copa Sul-Americana final, and probably would use an alternative team against Botafaogo. The game against Athletico finished 1-1. On that same week, they lost home against Cuiabá. Then things started to go incredibly downhill and they never won a game since. They would face Palmeiras on Wednesday on game 31, and at the time, Palmeiras was second place, 6 points behind Botafogo. So, if they win, they would open 9 points to second place, with 8 games to play because they had that game against Fortaleza. Botafogo was playing home, and they opened 3-0 on first half. Second half Palmeiras made 3-1, and Botafogo had one player sent off. But then they got a penalty on minute 82, but... they lost the penalty and saw Palmerias make a comeback from 3-1 to 3-4, scoring a goal on last minute. The difference fell to 3 points. So, next Monday they had a derby against Vasco, who is fighting against relegation, and they lost 1-0. Palmeiras won their game. They were tied on points. On Thursday, Botafogo would face Grêmio at home. Again, they opened 3-1 and then...Luis Suarez scored a hat-trick and won 4-3 to Grêmio. They had bottled two times a 3-1 score at home inside one week and had lost the top of the league. But the craziest thing is that on that day, a RBD show would happen on Rio de Janeiro, on Botafogo's stadium, so the game needed to go somewhere else and they played on Vasco's field, which allowed Luis Suarez to play, because Botafogo use a synthetic grass on their field, and Suarez have a knee problem that he can't play on synthetic grass. Vasco's stadium, otherwise, have natural grass, so Suarez was allowed to play and score a hat-trick. Next game, they faced Bragantino away, and was winning the game until last minute, when they conceded a goal and drew 2-2. Then last Sunday they played Santos at home, a team who also is fighting relegation. They were winning 1-0 then conceded a goal on last minute, again. And finally last Wednesday, they were facing Coritiba away, a team who was already relegated and was playing in an empty stadium because their fans fought Cruzeiro fans inside the pitch during a game. At this time, if Botafogo win, they would be only 1 point behind Palmeiras. Everything was normal, they were drawing 0-0 when Botafogo got a penalty on 95 minute. They score. The referee add two more minutes because the delay to shoot the penalty and to celebrate, then on next attack, Coritiba scores on 99 minute. And they fumbled again and was 3 points behind Palmeiras, but they have less goal difference. The only normal game they had was the one against Fortaleza, which they tied 2-2 but without any crazy thing happening on last minute. And to finish, today they drew 0-0 with Cruzeiro and officially don't have chance to be champions because Palmeiras won a game against Fluminense, who is a Botafogo rival and is thinking about Club World Cup, so they played an alternative team. Right now Botafogo is 5th and they have chances of not getting a place on Libertadores group stage next week, needing to play 2 play-offs to get the spot. They were the best team in history on the first 19 games, and then the last 19 they have a campaing of a relegated team. They were so ahead that they have now 10 games without a single win and still are on top 5 teams on the league. There is a saying in Brazil that ""there's some things that only happen with Botafogo"", but what happened during this league is way beyond anyone could expect. &#x200B;"	41.0	t3_18a6ykq	reddit

Me and a small minority of fans maintain that we want to see players with proper technical ability. imo Mount = Not an explosive dribbler, poor passer and chance creator from open play, struggles to play in one set position, horrible decision making in transitions, very poor vs both low blocks and elite teams with mid blocks, poor under tight spaces, stops demanding the ball for large portions of the game and is invisible. Gallagher = Not an explosive dribbler, very very poor progressive passer for the most part, not good at receiving the ball under pressure, zero ability in tight spaces, overall very poor end product and completely useless vs low blocks.

But i think is both of them will not perform good at real madrid cz haland gets very few touches and does not involve in the game much ( he hardly has 5-6 touches every game and 2 of them converts into goal ) but that can not happen at the Bernabeu as both systems are very different from each other and any real madrid's striker need to involve in the game more. But if we put mbappe as a striker that most of the people think that will be extraordinary and the attack will be so powerful that no one can beat us in speed and dribbling. But but but what i think is that even mbappe will fail here as he is more of a number 7 instead of number 9 he can play as a striker but can not do what a pure number 9 can as he does not have that attributes, example like benzama, kylian is fast and is a great dribbler that's good but they are not that much necessary if you are playing as a central striker, almost most of the strikers they are not very good dribblers and many of them are not even pacy examples like Giroud so I don't see mbappe playing as a central striker and that has so much to do with the future plans and not much people talks about it. I might be wrong here correct me and let's discuss about this.	19.0	t3_189zly9	reddit

Another key change that seemed to take place around 2004/5 is after decades of shirt tucked in, shirts suddenly became untucked and that seems to show no sign of changing. Will we ever tuck in again?

Actually, it's pretty common here to play this way at the streets or even in some fields or futsal courts. The main problem is: I never get used to play with boots on. I'm really good playing when I'm barefoot, but as soon as i'm wearing shoes or boots I can't even run properly. I'm not exagerating. When I'm wearing football boots I unlearn how to run, to kick, to pass. I feel like I can't run, it's so weird. My kicks get weak. The ball keeps slipping of my feet. During my whole life I could never learn and get used to it. And I really hate myself for it, because I missed many oportunities of matches and championships here just because of it. Here where I live I've found many other guys that has the same problem as me. Actually it's pretty common here where I live for us to play barefoot - what we call ""peladas"" (basically play football with your friends, not a real match). But when I'm in a different city sometimes it happens of them don't accept anyone playing barefoot, they say someone can hurt me or they'd have to avoid contact with me not to hurt me (the last one makes sense). Does it happen to you guys? Have you ever found someone that shares this same problem? How could I get used to it?

We don't need the EFL Cup too. Most clubs priorities the FA Cup way more, it's a more prestigious prize and the tournament has way more fixtures. Clubs also prioritise league matches over the EFL Cup anyway, so the EFL just adds to the fixture congestion of a lot of teams. Players are getting injured across every team anyway. During a busy fixture schedule, clubs have to put together a team to play in the EFL cup midweek whilst trying to save their best players for the important league match 3 days later, but also trying not to get humiliated too badly in a Cup game that most teams don't really care too much about.	40.0	t3_18a7r6u	reddit

They are treating football like baseball and think just statistics can answer everything about a player and that football is some kind of perfect statistical experiment. Football just has too many variables that occur and players influence occurs far beyond a stat sheet. Imo even advanced stats dont show it properly. In fact I have an issue with people using 'big chances created' as a sole metric for creativity, but a guy dribbling and attracting 4 guys making a simple pass and then that guy getting an assist does not show creativity for the original player. Imo eye test is king and stats can be used to supplement them, im sure a lot of you disagree though.	44.0	t3_18807ku	reddit		
557	To Those Who Don't Like VAR, How Can we Make it Better?	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-01 15:26:06	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/188ek74/to_those_who_dont_like_var_how_can_we_make_it/	There is no denying the fact that too many games this season have been affected so much by dubious referring decisions that post match, no one talks about football and all focus goes on VAR and referees. Not that 50-50s weren't often given wrongly before VAR, but now that it is in place, it is just natural for fans to expect that to get fixed. But at least to me, it doesn't seem like it is fully working. That said, there are a lot of other games which are integrating new technology much better into themselves. And surely there are better ways to implement VAR than how it is being done currently? For example: 1. Don't review each and every little incident, and save your brain juice for when a review is actually needed. 2. Review only when it is requested by the on field referee, or either of the two team captains. 3. Every team should get 1/2 review requests per match, and only in the case of a successful review they keep their challenge. 4. Don't sit a whole panel of judges in the VAR room, that just ensures that multiple different opinions will just slow everything down. Only a single guy should be sitting in the room, and his word should be law. 5. Remove offsides from the scope of VAR, as they depend too much on what camera angle is shown, as drawing a straight line over a pitch is apparently not straightforward. At least until the technology becomes better. 6. The handball rule needs to be standardized. Currently too much is left to the referee's judgement. What exactly is 'unnatural?' 'deliberate?' 7. Slow motion makes things look much worse than they actually are. Before making any major decision, especially penalty awards, they need to see the real time feed as well to get an idea of did the player actually have any chance of getting his hand away in time... Or did they obstruct the play with their hand or did it just bounce off another body part to it much faster than a human can be expected to react... How do you guys feel about this? If you are fine with the current state, why? And if you feel it should be scrapped, what makes you feel so? And are there things you feel can make VAR much more useful and less controversial?	19.0	t3_188ek74	reddit

563	Do spectacular goals scored increase spectacular goals attempted?	:Soccer_ball:	2023-11-30 23:02:30	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/187vz9w/do_spectacular_goals_scored_increase_spectacular/	Wondering if there’s any way to confirm something I feel like I’ve noticed. Ever since Garnacho’s overhead kick, I feel that I’ve seen more overhead kicks attempted. One moment that stands out is (I think) in the Real Madrid v Napoli game this week where I believe two players in a row attempted an overhead kick on the same play. My hypothesis: An overhead kick goal being scored increases the odds that players will attempt overhead kick goals in the following weeks because seeing someone else do it gives players the confidence to try it themselves. Does anyone have access to the data to test this hypothesis? It’s also very possible that I’m just noticing it more. That would be the null hypothesis.	9.0	t3_187vz9w	reddit

I've never been to such a large competition and don't really know how to source tickets. In my country they will be a couple of thousand tickets available for fans in the next weeks through our Football Association. The thing is, this tickets are personalized. I will apply and I would ask a few of my friends to apply so I have a better chance but I'm not sure I can go if they get a ticket which is tied to their name and an ID is needed at the stadium. I'm not even sure how this works because I was in France during the 2016 EUROS(not for football) and they were selling tickets in front of stadiums before matches and some of my friends bought them and got in. Also I would like to know how to get tickets for other teams. In my country I can only buy a ticket for matches of our team.	3.0	t3_188lpah	reddit

However, one thing that they are not talking about is about Language and Power. First of if we are playing a game what does it matter the player's skin color. Why is their whole identity reduce their skin color? This is something that insightful anti-racist Spaniard, Spain suffers from huge racist problems and there's some a minority of Spaniards who have come forward against it, said as soon as you disagree with a player you start calling him ""Negro/Black."" Is that he only thing about them? He also said that this happens in Spanish society outside of the pitch, if you disagree with someone on the street the first thing they bring up is the person's skin color. I've rarely seen people in the English speaking especially those who are not from African descendent, say ""Hey black,"" ""this black"" or 'it had to be the black one"" ""my black,"" use this phrases like they do in Argentina and Spain. We also rarely hear how some people who are dark skinned(those who are not even from African descent feel about this ""nicknames"" being used against them. Maybe one of your friends doesn't find it offensive but how about everyone else? Why should you give racially charged nicknames to others and people are just supposed to accept it? And if they don't like it they then the problem is with them? This whole ""Acomplejado"" a form of victim blaming. Then if we go to the alleged term of 'enderment"" 'negrita."" Are some people low creative that that's the only term of enderment you can come up with? One that is borderline racially charged. I could simply use 'granny"" for grandmother or something like that. To me they just lack ""Common Sense.' Its similar to this other racially charged nicknamed, 'Chino' to refer to everyone who has Asian descent. Many people outside and some people inside of Latin America don't like it. I had some Asians come forward and told me that they are Japanese and not Chinese. And they don't like being called this type of ""Nickname."" **Why should it fall on the Victim to have a 'thick skin"" and tolerate racially charged nicknames?** It seems the smarted move is the one of the Premier League of just **'don't go there.""** Don't be giving people racially charged nickanmes or make racially charged jokes."	15.0	t3_1894d4u	reddit		
566	What do you think is the ceiling for someone like Jude Bellingham considering what he is doing for Real Madrid at 20 years old with 15 goals (+ 4 assists) in only 16 games on his very first season?	:Soccer_ball:	2023-11-30 08:35:42	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/187dvhp/what_do_you_think_is_the_ceiling_for_someone_like/	Jude Bellingham has taken Real Madrid and World Football by a storm right now! He's gathered 15 goals + 4 assists in just 16 games for Real Madrid breaking the records of Puskas, Di Stefano and Ronaldo himself. All of this while just recently turning 20 years old, with his entire career ahead of him. What he's doing is unheard of, perhaps only Ronaldo Fenomenon himself had a better start to the season than him as a 20 years old. The differentiator however is his impact in the game, he's truly bossing the free role at Madrid contrubuting in goals, assists, key passes, dribbles, crosses, headers, flicks, finishing, playmaking, 1-2 passing, off ball movements, interceptions, tackles, positioning, strength, dominating, work rate and even leadership.. There is truly nothing that this boy can't do! I genuinely cannot point a single weakness in his game right now, he's top of the charts for almost all attributes since the start of the season. So these achievements so far in the season brings the question, **What is his ceiling as a footballer provided he continues this streak? Generational? All-Timer? GOAT candidate?**	81.0	t3_187dvhp	reddit

Those of us who remember Rivaldo, falling with his hands over his face like he’d been shot v Turkey - slow mo showed the ball went absolutely nowhere near his face, nor did anything else but his own hands. He played a decisive part after this. We see a few teams, less these days thankfully. Playing destructive football, breaking up the play with cynicism (ahem - cough Atletico, when things go against coughing Mourinho. Guardiola himself has employed those tactics to frustrate etc ) and diving.

I definitely feel as if the gap between the elite teams and the second tier teams is smaller. Even clubs that have still been spending like Psg are clearly struggling. I don't feel as if there is a huge gap between Real Madrid, Bayern, man cty when compared to Atletico, inter and arsenal. I could definitely see some upsets and surprise finalists in this years completion. Psg might not make it out of the group phase. Barcelona is still psychologically struggling to recover from the Valverde era. Real looks good, but they aren't dominant in a scary way. Bayern looks good but they aren't even first in their league this year. Even man city looks less dominant this year. I definetly think we'll see some surprises this year. I think even man united can be a threat in the next round. They have had a lot of injuries which people overlook. They haven't had their starting fullbacks, and a lot of their midfielders have been out through the season so far. Despite that they only have one less win than man city in the league. If they can make it out of the groups we could see a different team by the time ro16 begins.	8.0	t3_186svqb	reddit

But the refs and the ridiculous rules are ruining the game. Last night in the Fulham game and tonight watching Newcastle vs PSG the refs and VAR have given the stupidest penalty decisions. I’m really starting to lose my love for the game. I don’t care who won or drew the game but the integrity of the game has gone. I hate it and it’s just been getting worse season after season.

Now, you can replace half the outfield players, which basically means you can change tactics completely. It means more of the result is down to the manager. It also means there's less need to prioritise which games are important, you can start with your best 11 every game, and just substitute later if the result allows it. It also benefits clubs with bigger budgets more, as they can afford having a higher quality bench. Edit: Bring on the downvotes. As a grumpy old man I don't mind.	36.0	t3_186fjzi	reddit

The premier league having a “big six” and only 2 different teams qualifying for UCL in years (Leicester and Newcastle). La Liga being a 2 horse race with occasional atletico. Even serie A has 5-6 good teams and every one doesn’t compete. Ligue 1 is only PSG. How do fans just accept that domestic leagues have no parity? There is no feasible way anyone can ever expect Brighton to win the PL when if they have one good year, their best players are bought. Big clubs are insanely well established and small teams can’t complete without getting bought out. It seems so unfair to me. Like, I feel like if the European scene was more fair with better parity, Dortmund should’ve been able to keep Haaland and Bellingham as their 2 starlets. The best example of this is Lewandowksi at Dortmund. He wins the league with Dortmund twice, loses to Bayern in the UCL final, and then just joins the best team. That was the best move for his career. It feels like the scene is just set so a team like Dortmund can never compete with Bayern. Or how after Real beat Atletico in 2014, Atletico’s keeper joined Real 4 years later, and now Real remains the super team with Atletico just trying to qualify for UCL knockouts. On another note, this is why I don’t think City deserve the hate they are getting, neither do Chelsea or PSG. They are becoming big clubs the only way possible. Atletico and Dortmund failed doing it the “organic way”. Their best players left for the big teams who beat them in UCL finals.

595	Has Mbappe finally transformed his playstyle to account for longevity???	:Soccer_ball:	2023-11-24 23:57:30	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18360xa/has_mbappe_finally_transformed_his_playstyle_to/	I feel that when he first burst onto the scene he was this ultra explosive winger who would knock the ball 20 feet out and chase it and ut felt like he was constantly at 100mph But the more i watch him play now he preserves his explosiveness more… he still is THAT FAST he only uses it when necessary. Far better at linkup play and off ball positioning to get into ideal positions and doesn’t try to take on his man as much as he once did in the past but instead just finds space with out the ball. Capable of playmaking at an elite level too (i believe he had the most assists in Europe 2 seasons ago)	33.0	t3_18360xa	reddit

He pressed better, controlled games better, gave better weighted passes, and was also a good dribbler when pressed (Iniesta was the better dribbler overall). I’d say he was the better one. 4. **Modric** and **Kroos** have far bigger careers with Madrid than **Zidane** did. 5. **Zidane** and **Ronaldinho** were great players but were sometimes frustrating to watch and ineffective even in their primes. Their convoluted style of doing simple things made them highlight champions. 6. **Luis Garcia** generally played the biggest role in taking Liverpool to the UCL final in 2005, but his name is hardly mentioned when that UCL win is mentioned (Gerrard, the Scouse, vs Garcia, the foreigner) 7. **Pique** was a better defender than **Puyol**. The latter was prone to mistakes and making rash decisions, while Pique was far more intelligent. 8. **Eto’o** had a bigger impact in Barca than **Suarez** did. The former came in 2004 when Barca hadn’t won the league since ‘99. He became the league top scorer for two straight seasons as Barca won the league, then the league and UCL double. He also won the treble in 2008/09. Suarez, on the other hand, came when Barca were already dominant, but just having a bad spell. 9. **Gerrard** dived for the penalty which led to Liverpool’s equalizer in 2005 UCL final. 10. **Carvalho** is the most underrated defender in his generation.

630	Best thing to do regarding PL Away games?	Unknown	2023-11-22 08:53:18	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1814skr/best_thing_to_do_regarding_pl_away_games/	Hey, My Dad and I are heading over to England from Australia in December, 17th onwards 'til early January. We're both massive Spurs fans' and have already got tickets for two home games (v Everton on 23rd & v Bournemouth on 31st) and we really want to go to see Spurs play Brighton away on the 28th. As I understand it, Away fan tickets will be near-impossible to get, so we're wondering what's the next best thing? We'd like to see the city of Brighton itself so we're either gonna overpay for home tickets off a third party seller (best I can get is £87 each plus a stupid amount of booking fees which add up to around $430 Aussie dollars for both) OR maybe just go watch it in a pub in Brighton itself or something like that, maybe just sticking with the Spurs supporters before/after. We're happy to spend a bit but already have invested a lot so trying to find the best option possible. What would you guys' recommend us do? Any help or any advice/tips whatsoever would be greatly appreciated.	5.0	t3_1814skr	reddit

Nobody can take it away from him. Having that said, I don't think Kane actually improved as a player at Bayern but rather his situation allows him to score goals a lot easier than before. Currently, Kane is on pace to surpass Lewandowski's record for most Bundesliga goals for 1 season. Before Kane would officially join Bayern, most people fully expected him to score loads of goals in Bundesliga. It's the most offensive minded league among Europe's top 5 league with higher goal ratio than anywhere else. Bayern have players who can provide tons of service for a striker.

Germany is currently ranked 15th in the FIFA rankings, which is clearly an unfair and meaningless ranking. To be honest, Germany's current FIFA ranking is about 40th place. That's how bad modern Germans are at football, and the German national team is extremely weak. Even against a weakened Germany, Japan is the only country since Qatar to have won by four points in an official game.

651	Who actually deserved the 2018 Ballon D'or?	:Soccer_ball:	2023-11-20 15:27:59	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/17zr0pq/who_actually_deserved_the_2018_ballon_dor/	"First of all I think it was a very tough Ballon D'or to make a call on. Some years it seems pretty obvious who deserves it and who will win. Other years there's 2 (or maybe 3) players that you can point out and say ""it's either going to be him or him"" (this year it was Messi and Haaland). But in 2018, I just don't think that was the case at all. There weren't 2 or 3 players that stood out from the rest. Obviously 2018 being a World Cup year complicated things. A lot of the Ballon D'or candidates who performed fantastically at club level didn't have a particularly impressive World Cup. I'm going to focus on Messi, Ronaldo, Greizmann and Modric, however I'm sure many other people would add Mbappe and Salah to the mix of main candidates. Messi, as he so often does, finished the year with the most goals and assists in European club football winning La Liga and Copa del Rey (1 goal and 2 assists in the final). However his World Cup was underwhelming, only scoring one goal, missing a penalty against Iceland and being eliminated in the Last 16 by France. Ronaldo scored an incredible 15 UCL goals in the 2017/18 season winning the UCL and UCL forward of the season. His goal scoring stats were impressive in every club competition that year. However, like Haaland this season, many people argued that his game was too goal-scoring orientated. He didn't contribute as much to playmaking and creating goals as he had in the past. Ronaldo had a fantastic start to the 2018 World Cup scoring a hattrick against Spain, but after that match, he missed a penalty against Iran and was only able to score 1 goal in his 3 other matches. Greizmann won the Europa League in the 2017/18 season scoring 2 goals in the final and winning player of the tournament. He had an incredible World Cup campaign scoring 4 goals and getting 2 assists. He also had a good La Liga campaign, Atletico finished second only to Barcelona, however his league stats that season were still completely dwarfed by Messi's phenomal numbers. To be honest Barcelona and Messi completely ran the show in Spanish football in 2018. Modric. Obviously between Messi, Ronaldo, Greizmann I don't think it's unreasonable to compare their stats in terms of goals and assists. They are all forward players who are expected to assist and score as many goals as possible. Modric obviously played deeper, as a central midfielder. It's not realistic to compare his stats to that of the other 3. Alongside Ronaldo, Modric won the Champions League with Real Madrid and won UCL Midfielder of the season that year. In the World Cup he scored twice and got an assist. With Croatia reaching the World Cup final he was awarded player of the tournament. Admittedly Croatia didn't have the toughest run of matches to get there, France had it much harder. However Croatia still thrashed Argentina (Modric goal), knocked-out the tournament holders Russia (Modric assist) and beat England in the semis. Not bad going at all. Overall, I think this was a really difficult Ballon D'or to judge. And with different players being successful in different competitions, a lot of it comes down to people's opinions on the importance of each tournament. Most people would classify the World Cup being the most important tournament, followed by the Champions League, but then how do you rank La Liga against the Europa League for example. Is Greizmann's Europa League success more valuable than Messi's La Liga and Copa del Rey success? Modric may have not won the World Cup, but to come second place with Croatia seems atleast equally as impressive as France winning the tournament itself, if not more impressive. Personally I really dont think Modric winning the Ballon D'or was that bad, given his success in the UCL and amazing run in the World Cup. To be honest though, I think any of those 4 (Messi, Ronaldo, Greizmann and Modric) could have won the Ballon D'or and I wouldn't have objected to it, it was a really tough vote. Who do you think deserved the 2018 Ballon D'or?"	49.0	t3_17zr0pq	reddit

Of course, they were not members of the A national team, but they were both U-22 players, and it was a match between the best members of the team who will carry the future of their country on their shoulders.

Sergio Busquets). The problem seemed to stem from the fact that my understanding of what system player meant was someone who needed to be in the right set up to play at their, often world class, best and that taking them out of that system or in a team with a very different play-style would result in a big drop off in performance. The person I was arguing with defined it as a player who is made to look better because they’re surrounded by better players in a ‘good system’, and is by definition not a key part of that system they just play a role. I think this severely underestimates the importance of tactics and systems which are implemented by managers as well ignores the nuance of what it means to be a ‘good’ player. I also can’t help but worry that it’s a symptom of FIFA playing that people view players through the lens of ‘what would they be like to use in a FIFA game’ and this colours opinions. To me, a system player can be better than a non-system player in the system but a non-system player is more adaptable and coachable rather than always just playing ’their game’.	12.0	t3_17znq9y	reddit

I’ve always wanted them to do so as they are a nation with lots of talent and high quality. *I have Israeli roots - they are in the play offs but flopped an easy group, though with some players injured. I think it’s important that the current team they have, which includes players of Palestinian descent like Ramzi Safuri and Anan Khalili, and of Ethiopian descent like Eli Dasa, qualify, firstly to show the diversity of their society on those who seem to get false impressions because of the government and military policies, and to help inspire people from minority groups, and progressives, to vote for people who can advance peace rather than hatred in the future. I do fear that the war etc will only advance the latter even though it is their handling of homeland security that allowed this to happen. These vile people also caused Munas Dabbur to leave the national team. However, plenty of those put down by the meaner people in their society have stayed and played a key role - The results of their under 20 and under 21 teams show the potential is there, and football can be the best provider of progressive social change *Armenia, a country with a dedicated diaspora and which I have a soft spot for due to football but also due to unrelated things like their Eurovision Song Contest acts from the ‘20’s. *Bulgaria, who used to be so good, and who I had friends from	12.0	t3_17zjbgm	reddit

The obvious answer is because of the size of the country. Only around 30,000 people. This explains why they are so much worse than most teams, but then I’ve got to looking at the records of other teams with similar populations. Both Gibraltar and Liechtenstein are also very bad (see 14-0 yesterday) and have similar populations, yet are considerably better than San Marino. San Marino have got one solitary win in their history. One. Liechtenstein have 15. Gibraltar have eight and they were only admitted FIFA 10 years ago!! Gibraltar and Liechtenstein generally beat San Marino comfortably too. It seems just impossible that San Marino are as bad as they are. Things seem to be improving, but not by much. Another answer is that Liechtenstein and Gibraltar both have wider diasporas to pick good players from which is somewhat true with a lot of dual British/Spanish players for Gibraltar and Swiss/German/Austrian for Liechtenstein. Still, San Marino, do you draw on their Italian diaspora. It’s not like they can’t produce good players, the first captain Massimo Bonini won the Champions League with Juventus!! Another theory I’ve seen is the relative leagues strengths. Gibraltar has a well set up football league and a lot of British players. Liechtenstein has Vaduz playing in the Swiss second division. San Marino also had a team in the Serie C not long ago! There is plenty of football culture in San Marino and the game is loved - i saw more football there than in Liechtenstein or Gibraltar. It’s not like they don’t care about football - they absolutely do and their culture is full of it. None of these explanations can describe how bad is San Marino are and I cannot either.

Unknown	2023-11-19 01:00:10	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/17yl39u/why_is_the_german_national_team_so_weak/	# In this post, let's discuss the root causes and factors of the weakness of the German national team, and enjoy the journey to Germany's return to power. &#x200B; First of all, it is my personal opinion that defense is the most important thing in modern football. Therefore, although it has been pointed out that the German national team lacks forwards and strikers and has a low scoring ability, this is a problem, but I disagree. As is clear from today's match against Turkey, the German national team loses games by conceding more goals than the team's scoring ability. Argentina's strength in winning the Qatar World Cup. And the reason for the strength of Argentina, which is ranked 1st in the World Cup 2026 qualifying. This is due to their high defensive strength, as Argentina concedes very few goals. The only time we conceded was two goals against Uruguay. This is tied for best among CONMEBOL World Cup 2026 Qualifiers. Currently, there is not a single decent defender among German football players. Therefore, in order for the German national team to make a comeback, it is urgently necessary to develop defenders. The German national team will continue to lose in official games until they improve their collapsing defense.	32.0	t3_17yl39u	reddit

In Asia and Africa, they already have different stages of qualification, although it’s a different setup to what I think Europe needs.

Seriously, having an international break every once in a while is fine I guess but why are we having two of them in the space of three weeks?! Can't something be done about this? Here are some suggestions: * Leagues continue. Half your squad is away on international duty? Tough luck. It makes for more interesting games if Man City have to play the kids against Luton. If not that then put all the cup games and league cup games in the international break weeks where teams are likely to rotate anyhow * Put as many international break games in as little time as possible. The World Cup and Euros only happen every two years so the odd number years could have a ton of international qualifiers in May and June. I know that other confederations have their tournaments in odd number years but still * Particularly for UEFA qualification to both the Euros and the World Cup create a two tier system so that the entirety of European domestic football doesn't stop so that Mbappé can statpad against part time Gibraltar gardners when they've already garanteed first spot. I know, I know, not every team has it wrapped up with two games to go (just ask Italy) but could we have a two tier system where the really bad teams like Andorra and San Marino play against each other and then face the bottom teams from the top tier?	6.0	t3_17yw4p4	reddit

Germans should come to Japan to learn football. Germans should study football in Japan's J League. The Germans will never be able to beat Japan in football again. &#x200B; P.S. By the way, don't forget the fact that Japan won a comfortable 4-2 victory over Turkey with the second team, the B team, rather than the best members. The German national team went into the match with an unusual strategy of using Havertz as the left back in a 4-2-2-2, but there is no doubt that they had the best squad, so there is no excuse.	22.0	t3_17ygsa9	reddit

Unknown	2023-11-16 10:13:05	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/17wjgix/what_is_one_of_the_best_turnarounds_in_football/	For me it was the 2016/17 UCL top scorer battle. After the round of 16 ended, Messi was the favourite to finish the season as the top scorer, with 11 goals in only 7 games played. At the same time Cavani had scored 8, Lewandowski and Aubameyang had scored 7. Meanwhile Ronaldo had scored **only 2 goals** until the quarter-finals started, even his teammate Morata had scored 3 and he only started one game in the competition. Flash-forward to the end of the campaign and Ronaldo finished the season with 12 UCL goals, after his brace in the final to help Real Madrid in their 12th (then) UCL trophy. A truly iconic turn-around that isn't talked about much in my opinion. Any other suggestions?	43.0	t3_17wjgix	reddit

Unknown	2023-11-16 12:24:54	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/17wlmkf/i_used_to_be_naturally_right_footed_now_i_am_what/	I’m 19, been playing football since I think I was about 7/8, and I used to be naturally right footed starting out. I think I was only dominantly right footed only for around a year or two as I mostly remember using my left foot a lot more than my right. And that’s the case now, I always use my left for shooting, crossing and passing etc. However, I will naturally go onto my right foot for dribbling and taking a first touch and most skills, in which I have far better control with. I would say I can use both feet pretty well, left being my dominant and most accurate now, where as my right is pretty solid and will only feel awkward to use about 30% of the time (mainly when shooting and crossing). I know this was long , I do apologise but does anyone know why this is the case? Why do I have better control and a better sense of dribbling with my right foot when I now feel like a “natural” left footer?	23.0	t3_17wlmkf	reddit

Unknown	2023-11-17 02:34:13	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/17x4sj3/new_to_the_sport_help_me_understand_team_finances/	In most American sports there’s salary caps to keep a level playing field. It’s beautiful bc Detroit Lions fans have ALWAYS had a garbage team, but now that they have a good coaching staff and some good talent, they can compete and are one of the better teams in the league. But in Europe, low level teams will generally NEVER compete with top teams. Is it uncommon in Europe due to the fact that every big league kinda wants a team from their league to compete in the UEFA Champions League? Therefore no league puts a salary cap on bc they’d be limiting themselves of the biggest trophy and prize money? So, the only way around that would have ALL top leagues to agree on a salary cap across the board, which would logistically be a nightmare right? And that’s why they wouldn’t do it? Like, in what universe does Hertha Berlin belong in the same league as Bayern last year? Sorry, I’m fascinated by the sport and I’m GENUINELY a fan now, just curious is all.

Tottenham's tie with City and then coming back against Ajax. Ajax devouring Real fearlessly. Only thing weak was that boring final. 2009-2010: This one had absolute bangers; Man Utd vs Milan and Man Utd vs Bayern were the absolute standouts. Inter's journey was pretty badass as well, especially against Barcelona. Seeing Jose eating Pep like that was pretty special. 2011-2012: Chelsea's journey was even more badass considering they were in such a messy season. Also, Bayern somehow knocking out one of the greatest Real sides to ever exist. And Chelsea dispatching Messi in his best year. Plus, the final was amazing. 2021-2022: I would include this one because it was hilarious; Ancelotti dropping his eyebrow and his side would automatically pull the most unlikely comeback to ever exist. Also, Villareal's deep run was pretty amazing, absolute giant slayers. 2003-2004: This one, I admit that I was to young to remember but damn!! Porto and Deportivo knocking out those absolute monster squads that Man Utd and Milan had. Also, Monaco was fire, and coupled with the fact that Greece won the Euros that year, I think it's safe to say that 2004 was the year of the underdogs.	51.0	t3_17wbrav	reddit

So even when team A batters team B, hits the post eight times and then concedes a last minute deflected winner, they weren’t unlucky, but Team B had a better mentality, or Team A’s manager always bottles things in Europe so this was inevitable, or it was actually the genius of dropping player X into a false 9 rather than playing a traditional striker that made the difference. The fact the best team doesn’t always win is what makes football interesting. Winning any big cup competition requires being both really good and really lucky. People should embrace that.	76.0	t3_17vzmqo	reddit

The others above played for clubs who won multiple trophies, and all won the champions league at least once. Aside from a smattering of Coppa Italias and one Scudetto, Totti didn’t win anything with Roma. For me, it’s easier for a top player to stay at a top club, rather than be a top player like Totti and stay at a club that was rarely considered the best in Serie A. For my money, he is the greatest one-club man of all time. Who would you choose?	252.0	t3_17vgi3x	reddit

It's ridiculous. I remember Inter's 2010-2011 side, who were still fresh from winning the treble and 5 scudetti in a row, and they were pretty spineless tbh. Did a decent season anyway, winning Copa Italia and making it to QF in the UCL, but didn't seem much interested in defending any of their competitions including Serie A, which Milan won comfortably. I know Mourinho left and also, there have been a couple of treble-winning sides since then who did just fine. But honestly, how common is it in sports to retain the same drive, even after achieving massive success? Not so common I'd say.

They're very well aware of the rules and know gambling within the sport is illegal, so I find it hard to sympathise with players like Tonali and his cabal. You've done an illegal thing and there are consequences for it.. that's it really. What made me laugh was Newcastle/the player angling it as an addiction problem - which it may be in some cases like Ivan Toney's, but the majority of players get by fine without gambling as far as we know.

But i havent seen a post about an 11 of players you enjoy. So for this post just tell us your favorite players 11. (can be because of on or off the pitch) Mine is: LW: Son - Not only is he one of the most enjoyable players in the prem rn, but he also is a great person off the pitch as well. ST: Giroud - Im a Chelsea fan but also like AC Milan and so Ive seen lots of Giroud and enjoy watching him play. RW: Messi - Hes the reason I started watching football and probably a big reason on why I started playing as well. Hes my goat and is an undisputed top 2 of all time. CM: Özil - More of a 10 but i wanna fit him in the formation because he was so enjoyable to watch and seemed magical with the ball. CDM: Kante - No reasons have to be put. CM: Valverde - I enjoy watching him play as he is a very well rounded player and I think he is one of the best CMs in the world for how well rounded he is. LB: Chillwell - Ive always been drawn to him and when hes not injured he truly is an amazing fullback able to cross in the box and dribble and such. He is also my current favorite player. CB: Sergio Ramos - Come on, its Sergio Ramos. CB: Thiago Silva - In my opinion hes one of the best cbs in the world right now, he is a very humble person as well and the fact hes one of the best at 39 is insane. RB: Reece James - Great player when uninjured, possible one of the best. And he is a great lad off the pitch. GK: Tough one but ill go with Neuer because of the way he revolutionized the goalkeeper position.	133.0	t3_17u9rz6	reddit		
741	Serious Question: Why is the Premier League much better at dealing with Discrimination/Racism than La Liga?	:Soccer_ball:	2023-11-14 00:16:23	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/17upave/serious_question_why_is_the_premier_league_much/	"Hey guys, Talking with many people and doing my own research I have come to this conclusion. For instance, I've read about player who went to the Premier League and were not called by any ""Racially charged"" nickname by their fellow players. Something had to go through on other leagues especially La Liga. To me this is ""Common Sense"" and I don't believe the ""term of endearment"" argument that some people put forth, usually closet racists. Since ethnic identification should be more of ""private matter"" and has nothing to do with football or work collegues or friends on the pitch. For instance,if I had a friend from a different ethnic group I don't think it should be up to me to start giving him nicknames based on his ethnicity; To me that's crossing the line. I've also heard the Premier League fans at the stadium behave better than the La Liga. I seen videos of how Spaniards behave towards players from minority groups. They'll shout all kinds of racial slurs. It seems to be a extremely hostile environment. The three main objections that Spaniards and the Directors of Spanish Football put forth are: 1-**Fatalism**: Nothing can be done. Spanish Society is Racist, Football its Racist, The World is Racist. I'm not buying it if this was the case, then how are Brits able to do something about it? **2-Empathy towards the evil doer and not the victims:** I've seen this with Spaniards but also with Argentinians. Like,'Oh those poor working class people, they don't know any better."" If you start giving them fines you'll be doing them a great harm since they don't have much money' I heard some Spaniards say, ""Vinicius and other minority players are rich they need to get over it."" **3-It would be too expensive:** Some people say that if they start implementing these reforms it would be too expensive and they would lose fans. What do you guys think? How was the Premier League able to overcome these objections?"	23.0	t3_17upave	reddit

When I see such people and there are millions of them worldwide and especially in the UK I automatically wonder if you have to be low IQ to be a football fan. You don't need stats to tell you that United are terrible. If you have eyes you can see that they are scrapping through and not heading in the right direction. On the other hand if you can understand football you could have figured out that Chelsea on the other hand for all their defeats are headed in the right direction. They might be down in the points table but there is a plan that is slowly working at Chelsea. If you just give it time they will be in the reckoning sooner or later. How is something as basic as this not evident to people.	99.0	t3_17u34vo	reddit

Also let’s not forget how the ucl format is changing to basically copy the super league. Super league benefits every club and everyone except UEFA. That’s why so many clubs supported it last time. Last time the only argument on why we shouldn’t do it was small clubs would miss out but now that’s gone. We want entertainment, not the same stuff every season.

745	my alternative scenario for the transfers during the first Galácticos era at Real Madrid from 2002 to 2006	Unknown	2023-11-14 01:54:19	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/17urad3/my_alternative_scenario_for_the_transfers_during/	"the main issue on the transfers during the first Galácticos era at Real Madrid between 2002 and February 2006 (when Florentino Perez resigned) was the lack of balance; too many attacking outlets and little-to-no defensive transfers. if I was Perez at that time, I would do it a bit differently, balancing between attacking and defensive, and also between popularity and necessity. here is how I would do it. 1. **Summer transfer window 2002**: CB option 1: Fabio Cannavaro, Italy, age 28 at that time, from Parma (yes, long before his actual transfer in 2006)\^ CB option 2: Alessandro Nesta, Italy, age 26 at that time, from Lazio\^ CB option 3: instead of Woodgate (which came in 2004), I would suggest a bolder option, which is Rio Ferdinand. an English, age 23 at that time, from Leeds United\^ CF, Ronaldo Nazario, Brazil, age 25 at that time, from Inter Milan (actual transfer) \^not all options had to be bought, at most two in each position 2. **Summer transfer window 2003**: DM option 1: Patrick Vieira, France, age 27 at that time, from Arsenal\^ DM option 2: Massimo Ambrosini, Italy, age 26 at that time, from AC Milan (would be quite sensible, because he faced tough competition against Andrea Pirlo, Gennaro Gattuso and Cristian Brocchi in AC Milan)\^ DM option 3: Emerson, Brazil, age 27 at that time, from AS Roma (long before his actual transfer in 2006, which I think was a bit too late)\^ CB option 1: Gabriel Milito, Argentina, age 22 at that time, from Independiente (almost became reality, but he did not pass the medical test due to injury)\^ RM, David Beckham, England, age 28 at that time, from Manchester United (actual transfer, but I partially disagree because of the redundancy) \^not all options had to be bought, at most two in each position 3. **Summer transfer window 2004**: \*CF, Michael Owen, England, age 24 at that time, from Liverpool (again, this is the actual transfer; without the weird ""having-to-play superstars"" policy, he would have got more playing chances, especially when Ronaldo Nazario got injured while also having weight issues, and stayed in Madrid for a bit longer) \*no need for other transfers like Walter Samuel, Jonathan Woodgate and Thomas Gravesen, because, according to this scenario, we already brought defensive transfers for the past two years. up until this part, unlike in real life, the team would be a bit more balanced with at least one more true defensive-minded midfielder. Let's compare the line-up of the Clasico on 20 November 2004 to the hypothetical version according to this scenario: Actual: GK: Iker Casillas DF: Francisco Pavon, Walter Samuel, Michel Salgado, Roberto Carlos MF: Guti, David Beckham, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane FW: Raul Gonzalez (SS), Ronaldo Nazario (CF) Hypothetical: GK: Iker Casillas DF: Alessandro Nesta, Francisco Pavon, Michel Salgado, Roberto Carlos MF: Patrick Vieira, Massimo Ambrosini, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane FW: Raul Gonzalez (SS), Ronaldo Nazario (CF) as can be seen, on-paper it looks a bit more balanced between attack and defense. in real life, from 2003 to 2006, they did not get any silverware (mainly due to the imbalanced squad), but with my suggested alternative signings, I think they could be a bit more fortunate. 4. **Summer transfer window 2005**: I mostly agree with their 2005-06 signings, except for maybe two Uruguayans Diogo Enseñat and Pablo Garcia. although I would have added one more player for the full-back positions: LB, Ashley Cole, England, age 24 at that time, from Arsenal (one year after the invincible season, he could be a back-up and ""future"" replacement for Roberto Carlos, especially when the Madrid board had not considered Marcelo at that time) for the right-back position (to back-up Michel Salgado), they already brought Sergio Ramos, but in case they did not, I would have suggested Philipp Lahm, a 21-year-old from Germany and Bayern Munchen."	0.0	t3_17urad3	reddit

I know their team is full of world-class footballer but it still takes a good manager to take them that far. So, what happened? Edit: Just check the stats and how bad Mourinho did in the first month or so in the 07-08 season. Grant lost one game all season in the prem since October and that's elite managerial result. If not for that bad start and Ronaldo's insanity, they will win the prem. This first season for a manager is even better than Fergie's, Pep's and Klopp's!

Gullit, Yaya Toure, Matthaus and in general box2box players could do anything from defending to scoring. Pogba when he was world class is a good example. Defenders who scored regurarly like Ramos, Hierro or Koeman, even fullbacks like Marcelo or Dani Alves are exceptional on many things.

Compare it with the new gen that started around 5 years ago. Like last 30 years look at forwards - Suarez, Rooney, Ronaldo, Cantona, Stoichov, Shevshenko, Fowler Owen, Torres, Zlatan, Lewandowski, Del Piero, rivaldo, romario, Henry, Aguero, Falcao, Villa, Drogba, Tevez, Berbatov, Batistuta, Totti, Cavani, Cole, Etoo, Benzema, Van Basten They were all supremely technically skilled and not just goal poachers and movement guys. Look at the wingers and attacking midfielders, look at how much overall skill they had in past 30 years Messi, Ronaldo, Ronaldhinho, Hazard, Neymar, Baggio, Ribery, Robben, Ozil, Silva, Mata, Zola, Kaka, Giggs, Figo, Beckham, Sanchez, Mahrez, Salah, Bale, Pires, Ljumberg, Maradona So much skill and completeness FInally look at the midfielders. Look how gifted they were in the passing game and how well they read the game, their ball control, keeping posession, creating chances etc. Pirlo, Xavi, Iniesta, Busquets, Ballack, Kroos, Modric, Fabregas, Alonso, Gerrard, Lampard, Scholes, KDB, Zidane, Gullit, seedorf, guardiola, Redondo, Mathaus These are all off the top of my head, there were double the players like this who im forgetting who were so complete.

Within that time he’s broken into the first team under Lampard with other cobham graduates. Many Chelsea fans would probably agree that this was a very fun and likeable team, a weird season where we had a transfer ban and lost Hazard. Pure Vibes, whatever happens, happens. No one knew what was gonna happen that season but we pipped top 4 with the likes of Tammy, Mount, Tomori and Reece. Under club Legend Lampard, this seemed like a fairytale with Mount as the main character. Fast forward, he has won back to back Chelsea player of the year awards after joining a prestigious list of Chelsea players that managed to get 10+ Goals and 10+ assists in a season. He played week in week out during these years and also has the CL Final assist under his belt as well and every manager he played under loved him. Before this season he was a regular England squad member. Was seen as one of the best young players around. What happened? Terrible terrible season last year yet Mount had done more than enough for Chelsea for many fans to be understandably upset when it seemed like he was about to join United. This was Chelsea’s poster boy, at the club since he was a child…He get’s sold for £65m. Before the season, many said United now had one of the best midfields in the league, Mount, Bruno, Casemiro yet you probably won’t find many saying the same thing right now. United have had a what seems to be, shaky start to the season yet only find themselves 1 spot out of Europe. Mount’s been injured for parts of it but even when he’s played has looked tired, just like last season. Not in the England squad and currently benched for United. Football is heavily subjected to recency bias. Chelsea with strong results against Spurs and City… but I don’t think many Chelsea fans would have Mount back in the team. For who? Midfield looks great, Sterling is playing well and Chelsea fans seem to particularly like Palmer. There doesn’t seem to be any regret in selling him? He went from being most people’s favourite Chelsea player to now not even being spoken about by those that loved him most as a player. Most view him as a snake, no?	18.0	t3_17ubk4s	reddit

Buffon comes in behind both at third. Fullbacks: Cafu was a no-brainer for me, and I shifted Maldini here to include Baresi at CB because I find Roberto Carlos to be one of the most overrated players in history. Centrebacks: Beckenbauer was a no-brainer, and Baresi was very underrated and more deserving than Roberto Carlos. Shoutout to Sergio Ramos though. Defensive Midfielder: The hardest working position in my eyes, so I had to include one. If I wanted two CAMs, I needed a CDM, so I went for the best option in Matthaus. Attacking Midfielders: The formation is wonky, but I went for two CAMs. This formation would let in 5 goals a game if it didn't have the greatest defense of all time. I chose Zizou because of how impactful he was when he played, and Pele as a Cam, because Pele was actually a CAM, not a striker, so he was the best option for me. Wingers: The goats. What can I say? Striker: Pele is better than Maradona, and so I would rather Pele play in his correct role and shift Maradona up top, as Pele will impact my team more. If I had a coach it would be Alex Ferguson	33.0	t3_17u5ao8	reddit

There are nine clubs that are sacred for the sport and should not ever be left out of any historic top 10, regardless of the order in which you put them and those are Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, AC Milan, Manchester United, Juventus, Inter Milan and Ajax. And no other team in Europe(and frankly, the world), is bigger than any of them. After those 9, put whatever club you want, put a Portuguese one, or Arsenal, or Chelsea, or whatever. But those 9 are non negotiable and leaving them out honestly makes any top 10 look either ignorant or made by a really young person.

Zidane said the number 10 is not as important as it used to be. The place and position of the number 10 are gone. He used 4-4-2 and 4-3-3 as an example, which are perhaps the two most used formations in football. Messi then agreed by saying there aren't many 10 left and the position that shows such player is the leader, the midfielder, and the link player is gone. It seems like the number is being handed to the superstars and to promote and advertise such players. Ansu Fati had no business wearing 10 for Barcelona. While Mabappe wears 10 for France, Griezmann is actually their 10. Rashford in Man United is not a 10. I could go on. When Messi and Neymar retire from national team duty, Jude Bellingham seems to be the only young player to fill that void. What do you guys think? EDIT: I'm linking the video. Timestamp 4:25.

783	Learning Risk Preferences in Markov Decision Processes: an Application to the Fourth Down Decision in Football	Nathan Sandholtz	2023-09-01 23:06:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00756v1	For decades, National Football League (NFL) coaches' observed fourth down decisions have been largely inconsistent with prescriptions based on statistical models. In this paper, we develop a framework to explain this discrepancy using a novel inverse optimization approach. We model the fourth down decision and the subsequent sequence of plays in a game as a Markov decision process (MDP), the dynamics of which we estimate from NFL play-by-play data from the 2014 through 2022 seasons. We assume that coaches' observed decisions are optimal but that the risk preferences governing their decisions are unknown. This yields a novel inverse decision problem for which the optimality criterion, or risk measure, of the MDP is the estimand. Using the quantile function to parameterize risk, we estimate which quantile-optimal policy yields the coaches' observed decisions as minimally suboptimal. In general, we find that coaches' fourth-down behavior is consistent with optimizing low quantiles of the next-state value distribution, which corresponds to conservative risk preferences. We also find that coaches exhibit higher risk tolerances when making decisions in the opponent's half of the field than in their own, and that league average fourth down risk tolerances have increased over the seasons in our data.			arxiv	['Lucas Wu', 'Martin Puterman', 'Timothy C.

784	Stochastic modelling of football matches	Luiz Fernando G. N. Maia	2023-12-07 14:59:04	http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04338v1	This paper develops a general framework for stochastic modeling of goals and other events in football (soccer) matches. The events are modelled as Cox processes (doubly stochastic Poisson processes) where the event intensities may depend on all the modeled events as well as external factors. The model has a strictly concave log-likelihood function which facilitates its fitting to observed data. Besides event times, the model describes the random lengths of stoppage times which can have a strong influence on the final score of a match. The model is illustrated on eight years of data from Campeonato Brasileiro de Futebol S\'erie A. We find that dynamic regressors significantly improve the in-game predictive power of the model. In particular, a) when a team receives a red card, its goal intensity decreases more than 30%; b) the goal rate of a team increases by 10% if it is losing by one goal and by 20% if its losing by two goals; and c) when the goal difference at the end of the second half is less than or equal to one, the stoppage time is on average more than one minute longer than in matches with a difference of two goals.			arxiv	['Teemu Pennanen', 'Moacyr A.

785	Random Walker Ranking for NCAA Division I-A Football	Thomas Callaghan	2003-10-30 17:59:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0310148v4	"Each December, college football fans and pundits across America debate which two teams should meet in the NCAA Division I-A National Championship game. The Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings employed to select the teams invited to this game are intended to provide an unequivocal #1 v. #2 game for the championship; however, this selection process has itself been highly controversial in recent years. The computer algorithms that constitute one part of the BCS standings often act as lightning rods for the controversy, in part because they are inadequately explained to the public. We present an alternative algorithm that is simply explained yet remains effective at ranking the best teams. We define a ranking in terms of biased random walkers on the graph formed by the schedule of games played, with two teams (vertices) connected by an edge if they played each other. Each random walker moves from team to team by selecting a game and ""voting"" for its winner with probability p, tracing out a never-ending path motivated by the ""my team beat your team"" argument. We study the statistical properties of a collection of such walkers, relate the rankings to the community structure of the underlying network, and demonstrate the results for recent NCAA Division I-A seasons. We also discuss the algorithm's asymptotic behavior, illustrated with some analytically tractable cases for round-robin tournaments, and discuss possible generalizations."			arxiv	['Peter J.

786	Comparison and validation of community structures in complex networks	Mika Gustafsson	2006-01-10 08:57:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0601057v1	The issue of partitioning a network into communities has attracted a great deal of attention recently. Most authors seem to equate this issue with the one of finding the maximum value of the modularity, as defined by Newman. Since the problem formulated this way is NP-hard, most effort has gone into the construction of search algorithms, and less to the question of other measures of community structures, similarities between various partitionings and the validation with respect to external information. Here we concentrate on a class of computer generated networks and on three well-studied real networks which constitute a bench-mark for network studies; the karate club, the US college football teams and a gene network of yeast. We utilize some standard ways of clustering data (originally not designed for finding community structures in networks) and show that these classical methods sometimes outperform the newer ones. We discuss various measures of the strength of the modular structure, and show by examples features and drawbacks. Further, we compare different partitions by applying some graph-theoretic concepts of distance, which indicate that one of the quality measures of the degree of modularity corresponds quite well with the distance from the true partition. Finally, we introduce a way to validate the partitionings with respect to external data when the nodes are classified but the network structure is unknown. This is here possible since we know everything of the computer generated networks, as well as the historical answer to how the karate club and the football teams are partitioned in reality. The partitioning of the gene network is validated by use of the Gene Ontology database, where we show that a community in general corresponds to a biological process.			arxiv	['Anna Lombardi', 'Michael Hornquist']	254.0
787	NFL Injuries Before and After the 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA)	Zachary O. Binney	2018-05-03 12:55:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01271v1	The National Football League's (NFL) 2011 collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with its players placed a number of contact and quantity limitations on practices and workouts. Some coaches and others have expressed a concern that this has led to poor conditioning and a subsequent increase in injuries. We sought to assess whether the 2011 CBA's practice restrictions affected the number of overall, conditioning-dependent, and/or non-conditioning-dependent injuries in the NFL or the number of games missed due to those injuries. The study population was player-seasons from 2007-2016. We included regular season, non-illness, non-head, game-loss injuries. Injuries were identified using a database from Football Outsiders. The primary outcomes were overall, conditioning-dependent and non-conditioning-dependent injury counts by season. We examined time trends in injury counts before (2007-2010) and after (2011-2016) the CBA using a Poisson interrupted time series model. The number of game-loss regular season, non-head, non-illness injuries grew from 701 in 2007 to 804 in 2016 (15% increase). The number of regular season weeks missed exhibited a similar increase. Conditioning-dependent injuries increased from 197 in 2007 to 271 in 2011 (38% rise), but were lower and remained relatively unchanged at 220-240 injuries per season thereafter. Non-conditioning injuries decreased by 37% in the first three years of the new CBA before returning to historic levels in 2014-2016. Poisson models for all, conditioning-dependent, and non-conditioning-dependent game-loss injury counts did not show statistically significant or meaningful detrimental changes associated with the CBA. We did not observe an increase in injuries following the 2011 CBA. Other concurrent injury-related rule and regulation changes limit specific causal inferences about the practice restrictions, however.			arxiv	['Kyle E.

788	Metabolomic measures of altered energy metabolism mediate the relationship of inflammatory miRNAs to motor control in collegiate football athletes	Nicole L. Vike	2020-06-23 18:43:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13264v1	Recent research has shown there can be detrimental neurological effects of short- and long-term exposure to contact sports. In the present study, metabolomic profiling was combined with inflammatory miRNA quantification, computational behavior with virtual reality (VR) testing of motor control, and head collision event monitoring to explore trans-omic and collision effects on human behavior across a season of players on a collegiate American football team. We integrated permutation-based statistics with mediation analyses to test complex, directional relationships between miRNAs, metabolites, and VR task performance. Fourteen significant mediations (metabolite = mediator; miRNA = independent variable; VR score = dependent variable) were discovered at preseason (N=6) and across season (N=8) with Sobel p-values less than or equal to 0.05 and with total effects at or exceeding 50%. The majority of mediation findings involved long to medium chain fatty acids (2-HG, 8-HOA, UND, sebacate, suberate, and heptanoate). In parallel, TCA metabolites were found to be significantly decreased at postseason relative to preseason. HAEs were associated with metabolomic measures and miRNA levels across-season. Together, these observations suggest a state of chronic HAE-induced neuroinflammation (as evidence by elevated miRNAs) and mitochondrial dysfunction (as observed by abnormal FAs and TCA metabolites) that together produce subtle changes in neurological function (as observed by impaired motor control behavior). These findings point to a shift in mitochondrial metabolism, away from mitochondria function, consistent with other illnesses classified as mitochondrial disorders, suggesting a plausible mechanism underlying HAEs in contact sports and potential avenue for treatment intervention.			arxiv	['Sumra Bari', 'Khrystyna Stetsiv', 'Linda Papa', 'Eric A.

789	A metabolomic measure of energy metabolism moderates how an inflammatory miRNA relates to rs-fMRI network and motor control in football athletes	Sumra Bari	2020-06-23 18:44:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14930v1	Collision sports athletes experience many head acceleration events (HAEs) per season. The effects of these subconcussive events are largely understudied since HAEs may produce no overt symptoms, and are likely to diffusely manifest across multiple scales of study (e.g., molecular, cellular network, and behavior). This study integrated resting-state fMRI with metabolome, transcriptome and computational virtual reality (VR) behavior measures to assess the effects of exposure to HAEs on players in a collegiate American football team. Permutation-based mediation and moderation analysis was used to investigate relationships between network fingerprint, changes in omic measures and VR metrics over the season. Change in an energy cycle fatty acid, tridecenedioate, moderated the relationship between 1) miR-505 and DMN fingerprint and 2) the relationship between DMN fingerprint and worsening VR Balance measures (all p less than or equal to 0.05). In addition, the similarity in DMN over the season was negatively related to cumulative number of HAEs above 80G, and DMN fingerprint was less similar across the season in athletes relative to age-matched non-athletes. miR-505 was also positively related to average number of HAEs above 25G per session. It is important to note that tridecenedioate has a double bond making it a candidate for ROS scavenging. These findings between a candidate ROS-related metabolite, inflammatory miRNA, altered brain imaging and diminished behavioral performance suggests that impact athletes may experience chronic neuroinflammation. The rigorous permutation-based mediation/moderation may provide a methodology for investigating complex multi-scale biological data within humans alone and thus assist study of other functional brain problems.			arxiv	['Nicole L.

790	Physics-informed machine learning improves detection of head impacts	Samuel J. Raymond	2021-08-19 17:11:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08797v1	In this work we present a new physics-informed machine learning model that can be used to analyze kinematic data from an instrumented mouthguard and detect impacts to the head. Monitoring player impacts is vitally important to understanding and protecting from injuries like concussion. Typically, to analyze this data, a combination of video analysis and sensor data is used to ascertain the recorded events are true impacts and not false positives. In fact, due to the nature of using wearable devices in sports, false positives vastly outnumber the true positives. Yet, manual video analysis is time-consuming. This imbalance leads traditional machine learning approaches to exhibit poor performance in both detecting true positives and preventing false negatives. Here, we show that by simulating head impacts numerically using a standard Finite Element head-neck model, a large dataset of synthetic impacts can be created to augment the gathered, verified, impact data from mouthguards. This combined physics-informed machine learning impact detector reported improved performance on test datasets compared to traditional impact detectors with negative predictive value and positive predictive values of 88% and 87% respectively. Consequently, this model reported the best results to date for an impact detection algorithm for American Football, achieving an F1 score of 0.95. In addition, this physics-informed machine learning impact detector was able to accurately detect true and false impacts from a test dataset at a rate of 90% and 100% relative to a purely manual video analysis workflow. Saving over 12 hours of manual video analysis for a modest dataset, at an overall accuracy of 92%, these results indicate that this model could be used in place of, or alongside, traditional video analysis to allow for larger scale and more efficient impact detection in sports such as American Football.			arxiv	['Nicholas J.

791	Predictive Factors of Kinematics in Traumatic Brain Injury from Head Impacts Based on Statistical Interpretation	Xianghao Zhan	2021-02-09 18:37:20	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05020v3	Brain tissue deformation resulting from head impacts is primarily caused by rotation and can lead to traumatic brain injury. To quantify brain injury risk based on measurements of kinematics on the head, finite element (FE) models and various brain injury criteria based on different factors of these kinematics have been developed, but the contribution of different kinematic factors has not been comprehensively analyzed across different types of head impacts in a data-driven manner. To better design brain injury criteria, the predictive power of rotational kinematics factors, which are different in 1) the derivative order (angular velocity, angular acceleration, angular jerk), 2) the direction and 3) the power (e.g., square-rooted, squared, cubic) of the angular velocity, were analyzed based on different datasets including laboratory impacts, American football, mixed martial arts (MMA), NHTSA automobile crashworthiness tests and NASCAR crash events. Ordinary least squares regressions were built from kinematics factors to the 95\% maximum principal strain (MPS95), and we compared zero-order correlation coefficients, structure coefficients, commonality analysis, and dominance analysis. The angular acceleration, the magnitude, and the first power factors showed the highest predictive power for the majority of impacts including laboratory impacts, American football impacts, with few exceptions (angular velocity for MMA and NASCAR impacts). The predictive power of rotational kinematics in three directions (x: posterior-to-anterior, y: left-to-right, z: superior-to-inferior) of kinematics varied with different sports and types of head impacts.			arxiv	['Yiheng Li', 'Yuzhe Liu', 'August G.

792	Machine-learning-based head impact subtyping based on the spectral densities of the measurable head kinematics	Xianghao Zhan	2021-04-19 06:58:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09082v3	Objective: Traumatic brain injury can be caused by head impacts, but many brain injury risk estimation models are not equally accurate across the variety of impacts that patients may undergo and the characteristics of different types of impacts are not well studied. We investigated the spectral characteristics of different head impact types with kinematics classification. Methods: Data was analyzed from 3,262 head impacts from lab reconstruction, American football, mixed martial arts, and publicly available car crash data. A random forest classifier with spectral densities of linear acceleration and angular velocity was built to classify head impact types (e.g., football, car crash, mixed martial arts). To test the classifier robustness, another 271 lab-reconstructed impacts were obtained from 5 other instrumented mouthguards. Finally, with the classifier, type-specific, nearest-neighbor regression models were built for brain strain. Results: The classifier reached a median accuracy of 96% over 1,000 random partitions of training and test sets. The most important features in the classification included both low-frequency and high-frequency features, both linear acceleration features and angular velocity features. Different head impact types had different distributions of spectral densities in low-frequency and high-frequency ranges (e.g., the spectral densities of MMA impacts were higher in high-frequency range than in the low-frequency range). The type-specific regression showed a generally higher R^2-value than baseline models without classification. Conclusion: The machine-learning-based classifier enables a better understanding of the impact kinematics spectral density in different sports, and it can be applied to evaluate the quality of impact-simulation systems and on-field data augmentation.			arxiv	['Yiheng Li', 'Yuzhe Liu', 'Nicholas J.

793	Study of Feature Importance for Quantum Machine Learning Models	Aaron Baughman	2022-02-18 15:21:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11204v4	Predictor importance is a crucial part of data preprocessing pipelines in classical and quantum machine learning (QML). This work presents the first study of its kind in which feature importance for QML models has been explored and contrasted against their classical machine learning (CML) equivalents. We developed a hybrid quantum-classical architecture where QML models are trained and feature importance values are calculated from classical algorithms on a real-world dataset. This architecture has been implemented on ESPN Fantasy Football data using Qiskit statevector simulators and IBM quantum hardware such as the IBMQ Mumbai and IBMQ Montreal systems. Even though we are in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the physical quantum computing results are promising. To facilitate current quantum scale, we created a data tiering, model aggregation, and novel validation methods. Notably, the feature importance magnitudes from the quantum models had a much higher variation when contrasted to classical models. We can show that equivalent QML and CML models are complementary through diversity measurements. The diversity between QML and CML demonstrates that both approaches can contribute to a solution in different ways. Within this paper we focus on Quantum Support Vector Classifiers (QSVC), Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC), and their classical counterparts. The ESPN and IBM fantasy football Trade Assistant combines advanced statistical analysis with the natural language processing of Watson Discovery to serve up personalized trade recommendations that are fair. Here, player valuation data of each player has been considered and this work can be extended to calculate the feature importance of other QML models such as Quantum Boltzmann machines.			arxiv	['Kavitha Yogaraj', 'Raja Hebbar', 'Sudeep Ghosh', 'Rukhsan Ul Haq', 'Yoshika Chhabra']	261.0
794	The MuSe 2022 Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge: Humor, Emotional Reactions, and Stress	Lukas Christ	2022-06-23 13:34:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05691v2	The Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge (MuSe) 2022 is dedicated to multimodal sentiment and emotion recognition. For this year's challenge, we feature three datasets: (i) the Passau Spontaneous Football Coach Humor (Passau-SFCH) dataset that contains audio-visual recordings of German football coaches, labelled for the presence of humour; (ii) the Hume-Reaction dataset in which reactions of individuals to emotional stimuli have been annotated with respect to seven emotional expression intensities, and (iii) the Ulm-Trier Social Stress Test (Ulm-TSST) dataset comprising of audio-visual data labelled with continuous emotion values (arousal and valence) of people in stressful dispositions. Using the introduced datasets, MuSe 2022 2022 addresses three contemporary affective computing problems: in the Humor Detection Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Humor), spontaneous humour has to be recognised; in the Emotional Reactions Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Reaction), seven fine-grained `in-the-wild' emotions have to be predicted; and in the Emotional Stress Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Stress), a continuous prediction of stressed emotion values is featured. The challenge is designed to attract different research communities, encouraging a fusion of their disciplines. Mainly, MuSe 2022 targets the communities of audio-visual emotion recognition, health informatics, and symbolic sentiment analysis. This baseline paper describes the datasets as well as the feature sets extracted from them. A recurrent neural network with LSTM cells is used to set competitive baseline results on the test partitions for each sub-challenge. We report an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of .8480 for MuSe-Humor; .2801 mean (from 7-classes) Pearson's Correlations Coefficient for MuSe-Reaction, as well as .4931 Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and .4761 for valence and arousal in MuSe-Stress, respectively.			arxiv	['Shahin Amiriparian', 'Alice Baird', 'Panagiotis Tzirakis', 'Alexander Kathan', 'Niklas Müller', 'Lukas Stappen', 'Eva-Maria Meßner', 'Andreas König', 'Alan Cowen', 'Erik Cambria', 'Björn W.

795	$H$-RANSAC, an algorithmic variant for Homography image transform from featureless point sets: application to video-based football analytics	George Nousias	2023-10-07 20:56:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04912v1	Estimating homography matrix between two images has various applications like image stitching or image mosaicing and spatial information retrieval from multiple camera views, but has been proved to be a complicated problem, especially in cases of radically different camera poses and zoom factors. Many relevant approaches have been proposed, utilizing direct feature based, or deep learning methodologies. In this paper, we propose a generalized RANSAC algorithm, H-RANSAC, to retrieve homography image transformations from sets of points without descriptive local feature vectors and point pairing. We allow the points to be optionally labelled in two classes. We propose a robust criterion that rejects implausible point selection before each iteration of RANSAC, based on the type of the quadrilaterals formed by random point pair selection (convex or concave and (non)-self-intersecting). A similar post-hoc criterion rejects implausible homography transformations is included at the end of each iteration. The expected maximum iterations of $H$-RANSAC are derived for different probabilities of success, according to the number of points per image and per class, and the percentage of outliers. The proposed methodology is tested on a large dataset of images acquired by 12 cameras during real football matches, where radically different views at each timestamp are to be matched. Comparisons with state-of-the-art implementations of RANSAC combined with classic and deep learning image salient point detection indicates the superiority of the proposed $H$-RANSAC, in terms of average reprojection error and number of successfully processed pairs of frames, rendering it the method of choice in cases of image homography alignment with few tens of points, while local features are not available, or not descriptive enough.

Genetic algorithm for detecting communities in complex networks, which is based on optimizing network modularity using genetic algorithm, is presented here. It is scalable to very large networks and does not need any priori knowledge about number of communities or any threshold value. It has O(e) time-complexity where e is the number of edges in the network. Its accuracy is tested with the known Zachary Karate Club and College Football datasets.

To detect communities in varied topics, there have been many algorithms proposed so far. However, most of them still have some drawbacks to be addressed. In this paper, we present an agent-based based community detection algorithm. The algorithm that is a stochastic one makes use of agents by forcing them to perform biased moves in a smart way. Using the information collected by the traverses of these agents in the network, the network structure is revealed. Also, the network modularity is used for determining the number of communities. Our algorithm removes the need for prior knowledge about the network such as number of the communities or any threshold values. Furthermore, the definite community structure is provided as a result instead of giving some structures requiring further processes. Besides, the computational and time costs are optimized because of using thread like working agents. The algorithm is tested on three network data of different types and sizes named Zachary karate club, college football and political books. For all three networks, the real network structures are identified in almost every run.			arxiv	['Haluk Bingol']	265.0

Matter can be localized on a codimension one brane coupled to the bulk gauge field and wrapped around an axis of symmetry of the internal space. By studying the linear perturbations around this background, we show that the gravitational interaction between sources on the brane is described by Einstein 4d gravity at large distances. Our model provides a consistent setup for the study of gravity in the rugby (or football) compactification, without having to deal with the complications of a delta-like, codimension two brane. To our knowledge, this is the first complete study of gravity in a realistic brane model with two extra dimensions, in which the mechanism of stabilization of the extra space is consistently taken into account.			arxiv	['Lorenzo Sorbo', 'Gianmassimo Tasinato']	266.0

Afantenos	2007-10-18 13:24:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.3502v1	In this paper we present a fresh look at the problem of summarizing evolving events from multiple sources. After a discussion concerning the nature of evolving events we introduce a distinction between linearly and non-linearly evolving events. We present then a general methodology for the automatic creation of summaries from evolving events. At its heart lie the notions of Synchronic and Diachronic cross-document Relations (SDRs), whose aim is the identification of similarities and differences between sources, from a synchronical and diachronical perspective. SDRs do not connect documents or textual elements found therein, but structures one might call messages. Applying this methodology will yield a set of messages and relations, SDRs, connecting them, that is a graph which we call grid. We will show how such a grid can be considered as the starting point of a Natural Language Generation System. The methodology is evaluated in two case-studies, one for linearly evolving events (descriptions of football matches) and another one for non-linearly evolving events (terrorist incidents involving hostages). In both cases we evaluate the results produced by our computational systems.			arxiv	['V. Karkaletsis', 'P. Stamatopoulos', 'C. Halatsis']	267.0

In the case that the branes carry only tension, we provide a way to supersymmetrise them by adding appropriate localised Fayet-Iliopoulos terms and localised corrections to the Chern-Simons term and modifying accordingly the fermionic supersymmetry transformations. The resulting brane action has N=1 supersymmetry (SUSY). We find the axisymmetric vacua of the system and show that one has unwarped background solutions with ""football""-shaped extra dimensions which always respect N=1 SUSY for any value of the equal brane tensions, in contrast with the non-supersymmetric brane action background. Finally, we generically find multiple zero modes of the gravitino in this background and discuss how one could obtain a single chiral zero mode present in the low energy spectrum."			arxiv	['Antonios Papazoglou']	268.0

For a network with $n$ nodes, every node is assumed to be a system which can send, receive, and record signals. Each node is taken as the initial signal source once to inspire the whole network by exciting its neighbors and then the source node is endowed a $n$d vector which recording the effects of signaling process. So by this process, the topological relationship of nodes on networks could be transferred into the geometrical structure of vectors in $n$d Euclidian space. Then the best partition of groups is determined by $F$-statistic and the final community structure is given by Fuzzy $C$-means clustering method (FCM). This method can detect community structure both in unweighted and weighted networks without any extra parameters. It has been applied to ad hoc networks and some real networks including Zachary Karate Club network and football team network. The results are compared with that of other approaches and the evidence indicates that the algorithm based on signaling process is effective.			arxiv	['Menghui Li', 'Peng Zhang', 'Ying Fan', 'Zengru Di']	269.0

A community is defined as a set of nodes, which satisfy that each node's degree inside the community should not be smaller than the node's degree toward any other community. In the algorithm, the attractive force of a community to a node is defined as the connections between them. Then employing attractive force based self-organizing process, without any extra parameter, the best communities can be detected. Several artificial and real-world networks, including Zachary Karate club network and College football network are analyzed. The algorithm works well in detecting communities and it also gives a nice description for network division and group formation.			arxiv	['Hongbin Chen', 'Peng Zhang', 'Menghui Li', 'Zengru Di', 'Ying Fan']	270.0
803	Supersymmetric codimension-two branes and U(1)_R mediation in 6D gauged supergravity	Hyun Min Lee	2008-03-18 17:43:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.2683v2	We construct a consistent supersymmetric action for brane chiral and vector multiplets in a six-dimensional chiral gauged supergravity. A nonzero brane tension can be accommodated by allowing for a brane-localized Fayet-Iliopoulos term proportional to the brane tension. When the brane chiral multiplet is charged under the bulk U(1)_R, we obtain a nontrivial coupling to the extra component of the U(1)_R gauge field strength as well as a singular scalar self-interaction term. Dimensionally reducing to 4D on a football supersymmetric solution, we discuss the implication of such interactions for obtaining the U(1)_R D-term in the 4D effective supergravity. By assuming the bulk gaugino condensates and nonzero brane F- and/or D-term for the uplifting potential, we have all the moduli stabilized with a vanishing cosmological constant. The brane scalar with nonzero R charge then gets a soft mass of order the gravitino mass. The overall sign of the soft mass squared depends on the sign of the R charge as well as whether the brane F- or D-term dominates.			arxiv	[]	271.0

805	The Orbifold Topological Vertex	Jim Bryan	2010-08-25 05:23:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4205v1	We define Donaldson-Thomas invariants of Calabi-Yau orbifolds and we develop a topological vertex formalism for computing them. The basic combinatorial object is the orbifold vertex, a generating function for the number of 3D partitions asymptotic to three given 2D partitions and colored by representations of a finite Abelian group G acting on C^3. In the case where G=Z_n acting on C^3 with transverse A_{n-1} quotient singularities, we give an explicit formula for the vertex in terms of Schur functions. We discuss applications of our formalism to the Donaldson-Thomas Crepant Resolution Conjecture and to the orbifold Donaldson-Thomas/Gromov-Witten correspondence. We also explicitly compute the Donaldson-Thomas partition function for some simple orbifold geometries: the local football and the local BZ_2 gerbe.			arxiv	['Charles Cadman', 'Ben Young']	273.0
806	Envelope Reconstruction of the 0S2 - free Oscillation of the Earth	Herbert Weidner	2010-12-15 10:02:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3259v1	The earthquake in December 2004 caused free oscillations of the Earth. Vibrates the earth in the football mode 0S2, splits the natural frequency due to rotation into five closely adjacent individual components. The sum of these spectral components in the frequency band near 309 {\mu}Hz produces a beat that gives the overall amplitude envelope a characteristic, regular pattern. From the measured envelope the parameters frequency, amplitude, phase and damping of generating sinusoids can be reconstructed. Since the method is extremely sensitive to changes in frequency and phase, these quantities can be determined precisely. The results depend on the geographical location of the site. Further results are the half-life of the amplitude decrease and the resonator Q. It is shown that the interaction of the five individual frequencies can be interpreted as amplitude modulation, which requires a nonlinear process in the Earth's interior.			arxiv	[]	274.0

We devise efficient data collection and event recognition solutions that work despite various limits on free access to Twitter data. We describe a web service implementation of our solution and report our experience with the 2010-2011 US National Football League (NFL) games. The service was able to recognize NFL game events within 40 seconds and with accuracy up to 90%. This capability will be very useful for not only real-time electronic program guide for live broadcast programs but also refined auction of advertisement slots. More importantly, it demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of using Twitter for real-time social and physical event detection for ubiquitous computing.			arxiv	['Lin Zhong', 'Jehan Wickramasuriya', 'Venu Vasudevan']	276.0

The article begins by introducing the constraints involved in interactive multiagent-based simulations. The second section pre- sents a framework stemming from case-based reasoning by autonomous agents. Each agent uses a case base of local situations and, from this base, it can choose an action in order to interact with other auton- omous agents or users' avatars. We illustrate this framework with an example dedicated to the study of dynamic situations in football. We then go on to address the difficulties of conducting such simulations in real-time and propose a model for case and for case base. Using generic agents and adequate case base structure associated with a dedicated recall algorithm, we improve retrieval performance under time pressure compared to classic CBR techniques. We present some results relating to the performance of this solution. The article concludes by outlining future development of our project.			arxiv	['Romain Bénard', 'Chevaillier Pierre']	277.0

Using the US National Football League (NFL) games as a case study, we report in-depth measurement studies of the delay and post rate of tweets, and their dependence on other properties. We subsequently develop a novel event detection method based on these findings, and demonstrate that it can effectively and accurately extract game events using open access Twitter data. SportSense has been evolving during the 2010-11 and 2011-12 NFL seasons and is able to recognize NFL game big plays in 30 to 90 seconds with 98% true positive, and 9% false positive rates. Using a smart electronic TV program guide, we show that SportSense can utilize human sensors to empower novel services.			arxiv	['Lin Zhong', 'Jehan Wickramasuriya', 'Venu Vasudevan', 'Robert LiKamWa', 'Ahmad Rahmati']	278.0

We present an empirical comparison of a variety of online and offline adaptive algorithms for aggregating experts' predictions of the outcomes of five years of US National Football League games (1319 games) using expert probability elicitations obtained from an Internet contest called ProbabilitySports. We find that it is difficult to improve over simple averaging of the predictions in terms of prediction accuracy, but that there is room for improvement in quadratic loss. Somewhat surprisingly, a Bayesian estimation algorithm which estimates the variance of each expert's prediction exhibits the most consistent superior performance over simple averaging among our collection of algorithms.			arxiv	['Omid Madani', 'David M Pennock', 'Sumit Sanghai', 'Brian Galebach']	279.0

Individual actions and group activities in videos can be represented in a common framework as they share the following common feature: both are composed of a set of low-level features describing motions, e.g., optical flow for each pixel or a trajectory for each feature point, according to a set of composition constraints in both temporal and spatial dimensions. In this paper, we present a unified model to assess the similarity between two given individual or group activities. Our approach avoids explicit extraction of individual actors, identifying and representing the inter-person interactions. With the proposed approach, retrieval from a video database can be performed through Query-by-Example; and activities can be recognized by querying videos containing known activities. The suggested video matching process can be performed in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the performance of our approach by recognizing a set of human actions and football plays.			arxiv	['Rama Chellappa']	280.0
813	The ranking lasso and its application to sport tournaments	Guido Masarotto	2013-01-14 12:42:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2954v1	Ranking a vector of alternatives on the basis of a series of paired comparisons is a relevant topic in many instances. A popular example is ranking contestants in sport tournaments. To this purpose, paired comparison models such as the Bradley-Terry model are often used. This paper suggests fitting paired comparison models with a lasso-type procedure that forces contestants with similar abilities to be classified into the same group. Benefits of the proposed method are easier interpretation of rankings and a significant improvement of the quality of predictions with respect to the standard maximum likelihood fitting. Numerical aspects of the proposed method are discussed in detail. The methodology is illustrated through ranking of the teams of the National Football League 2010-2011 and the American College Hockey Men's Division I 2009-2010.			arxiv	['Cristiano Varin']	281.0

The algorithm allows the ranking of the teams using the notions of hubs and authorities well known for ranking pages in the World Wide Web. Results of the games introduced as a graph where losing team 'gives a link' to a winning team and, if draw registered both team give links to each other. In case of a win link is weighted as three points in adjacent matrix and in case of draw as one point. Author uses notion of authority in order to define team which win a game and hub as a team which lose a game, the winner of the competition defined as the 'worst' hub, team that didn't reinforced any other team. Using this ranking system, the champion's team, which is a 'worst hub' must not lose, or draw games to other 'good authorities' teams. If by the end of the competition there are teams with an equal number of wins and losses then the team which has beaten more teams with higher authority ranks, wins.			arxiv	[]	282.0
815	Scoring dynamics across professional team sports: tempo, balance and predictability	Sears Merritt	2013-10-16 17:44:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4461v2	Despite growing interest in quantifying and modeling the scoring dynamics within professional sports games, relative little is known about what patterns or principles, if any, cut across different sports. Using a comprehensive data set of scoring events in nearly a dozen consecutive seasons of college and professional (American) football, professional hockey, and professional basketball, we identify several common patterns in scoring dynamics. Across these sports, scoring tempo---when scoring events occur---closely follows a common Poisson process, with a sport-specific rate. Similarly, scoring balance---how often a team wins an event---follows a common Bernoulli process, with a parameter that effectively varies with the size of the lead. Combining these processes within a generative model of gameplay, we find they both reproduce the observed dynamics in all four sports and accurately predict game outcomes. These results demonstrate common dynamical patterns underlying within-game scoring dynamics across professional team sports, and suggest specific mechanisms for driving them. We close with a brief discussion of the implications of our results for several popular hypotheses about sports dynamics.			arxiv	['Aaron Clauset']	283.0

We experiment with several feature sets and find that simple features using large volumes of tweets can match or exceed the performance of more traditional features that use game statistics.			arxiv	['Chris Dyer', 'Kevin Gimpel', 'Noah A.

The analysis is based on considerations about complex systems, i.e. searching whether power or other simple law fits are appropriate to describe some internal dynamics. It is observed that the ranking is specifically organized: a major class made of a few teams emerges after each game season. Other classes which apparently have regular sizes subsequently occur. Thus, the notion of Sheppard primacy index is envisaged to describe the findings. Additional primacy indices are discussed for enhancing the features. These measures can be used to sort out peer classes in more general terms. A very simplified toy model containing ingredients of the UEFA ranking rules suggests that such peer classes are an extrinsic property of the ranking, as obtained in many nonlinear systems under boundary condition constraints.			arxiv	['Adam Gadomski', 'Nikolay K.

Montenegro-Johnson	2014-11-18 09:53:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4783v1	"The lowest drag shape of fixed volume in Stokes flow has been known for some 40 years. It is front-back symmetric and similar to an American football with ends tangent to a cone of 60 degrees. The analogous convex axisymmetric shape of fixed surface area, which may be of interest for particle design in chemistry and colloidal science, is characterized in this paper. This ""other"" optimal shape has a surface vorticity proportional to the mean surface curvature, which is used with a local analysis of the flow near the tip to show that the front and rear ends are tangent to a cone of angle 30.8 degrees. Using the boundary element method, we numerically represent the shape by expanding its tangent angle in terms decaying odd Legendre modes, and show that it has 11.3% lower drag than a sphere of equal surface area, significantly more pronounced than for the fixed-volume optimal."			arxiv	['Eric Lauga']	286.0

Official regulation defines that the new postseason from the 2015 season consists of five teams selected by different principles --- the top three teams by total season points, and the winning teams of the 1st and 2nd half of the season. This paper clarifies that there are overlaps within these five teams and the average number of teams reaching the postseason is about 3.5. The probability that the postseason is held with 3, 4, and 5 teams are estimated about 0.62, 0.35, and 0.03, respectively. From this result, this paper concludes that the new system of J1 League is basically a one-stage system, whereas the new system is officially defined as a two-stage system, due to inappropriate design of the postseason.			arxiv	['Eiji Konaka']	287.0

In this work we used anonymized Call Detail Records (CDRs) comprising data on where and when users access the cellular network. Our approach is based on two key ideas: (1) we identify the network cells associated to the event location. (2) We verify the attendance of each user, as a measure of whether (s)he generates CDRs during the event, but not during other times. We evaluate our approach to estimate the number of attendees to a number of events ranging from football matches in stadiums to concerts and festivals in open squares. Comparing our results with the best groundtruth data available, our estimates provide a median error of less than 15% of the actual number of attendees.			arxiv	['Massimo Colonna']	288.0

Previous approaches typically compute candidate poses in individual frames and then link them in a post-processing step to resolve ambiguities. By contrast, we directly regress from a spatio-temporal volume of bounding boxes to a 3D pose in the central frame. We further show that, for this approach to achieve its full potential, it is essential to compensate for the motion in consecutive frames so that the subject remains centered. This then allows us to effectively overcome ambiguities and improve upon the state-of-the-art by a large margin on the Human3.6m, HumanEva, and KTH Multiview Football 3D human pose estimation benchmarks.			arxiv	['Artem Rozantsev', 'Vincent Lepetit', 'Pascal Fua']	289.0

The main challenge lies in the fact that traditional structural communities do not always capture the intrinsic features of metadata groups. Motivated by the observation that metadata groups in PPI networks tend to consist of an abundance of interacting triad motifs, we define a 2-club substructure with diameter 2 which possessing triad-rich property to describe a metadata group. Based on the triad-rich substructure, we design a DIVision Algorithm using our proposed edge Niche Centrality DIVANC to detect metadata groups effectively in complex networks. We also extend DIVANC to detect overlapping metadata groups by proposing a simple 2-hop overlapping strategy. To verify the effectiveness of triad-rich substructures, we compare DIVANC with existing algorithms on PPI networks, LFR synthetic networks and football networks. The experimental results show that DIVANC outperforms most other algorithms significantly and, in particular, can detect sparse metadata groups.			arxiv	['Lin Gao', 'Yong Gao', 'James Nastos', 'Xiao Wen', 'Xindong Zhang', 'Haiyang Wang']	290.0

We argue that the flow diagram representation gives an intuitive summary that allows the user to detect patterns among large sets of state sequences. Simplified, our aim is to generate a small flow diagram that models the flow of states of all the state sequences given as input. For a small number of state sequences we present efficient algorithms to compute a minimal flow diagram. For a large number of state sequences we show that it is unlikely that efficient algorithms exist. More specifically, the problem is W[1]-hard if the number of state sequences is taken as a parameter. We thus introduce several heuristics for this problem. We argue about the usefulness of the flow diagram by applying the algorithms to two problems in sports analysis. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms on a football data set and generated data.			arxiv	['Maike Buchin', 'Joachim Gudmundsson', 'Michael Horton', 'Stef Sijben']	291.0

State of the art object tracking systems now produce spatio-temporal traces of player trajectories with high definition and high frequency, and this, in turn, has facilitated a variety of research efforts, across many disciplines, to extract insight from the trajectories. We survey recent research efforts that use spatio-temporal data from team sports as input, and involve non-trivial computation.

The main contribution is development of an architecture that combines a linear model that is fitted using $\ell_1$ regularization and a sequence of $\tanh$ layers. The challenge of predicting traffic flows are the sharp nonlinearities due to transitions between free flow, breakdown, recovery and congestion. We show that deep learning architectures can capture these nonlinear spatio-temporal effects. The first layer identifies spatio-temporal relations among predictors and other layers model nonlinear relations. We illustrate our methodology on road sensor data from Interstate I-55 and predict traffic flows during two special events; a Chicago Bears football game and an extreme snowstorm event. Both cases have sharp traffic flow regime changes, occurring very suddenly, and we show how deep learning provides precise short term traffic flow predictions.			arxiv	['Vadim Sokolov']	293.0

Unlike in another common form of competition where two contestants play a head-to-head match to produce a winner as in football or basketball, the objectivity of judges are prone to be questioned, potentially undermining the public's trust in the fairness of the competition. In this work we show, by modeling the judge--contestant competition as a weighted bipartite network, how we can identify biased scores and measure their impact on our inference of the network structure. Analyzing the prestigious International Chopin Piano Competition of 2015 with a well-publicized scoring controversy as an example, we show that even a single statistically uncharacteristic score can be enough to gravely distort our inference of the community structure, demonstrating the importance of detecting and eliminating biases. In the process we also find that there does not exist a significant system-wide bias of the judges based on the the race of the contestants.			arxiv	['Juyong Park']	294.0

A simple, widely applicable analysis is proposed to address the possibility that the treatment or control condition exists in two versions with two different treatment effects. This analysis loses no power in the main comparison of treatment and control, provides additional information about version effects, and controls the family-wise error rate in several comparisons. The method is motivated and illustrated using an on-going study of the possibility that repeated head trauma in high school football causes an increase in risk of early on-set dementia.			arxiv	['Sameer K.

Deshpande	2017-08-29 17:56:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08911v2	We propose a Bayesian procedure for simultaneous variable and covariance selection using continuous spike-and-slab priors in multivariate linear regression models where q possibly correlated responses are regressed onto p predictors. Rather than relying on a stochastic search through the high-dimensional model space, we develop an ECM algorithm similar to the EMVS procedure of Rockova & George (2014) targeting modal estimates of the matrix of regression coefficients and residual precision matrix. Varying the scale of the continuous spike densities facilitates dynamic posterior exploration and allows us to filter out negligible regression coefficients and partial covariances gradually. Our method is seen to substantially outperform regularization competitors on simulated data. We demonstrate our method with a re-examination of data from a recent observational study of the effect of playing high school football on several later-life cognition, psychological, and socio-economic outcomes.			arxiv	['Veronika Rockova', 'Edward I.

The traffic dataset contains over 900 million data records. The network is thereafter used to classify the real-time data and identify anomalous operations. Compared with traditional approaches of using statistical or machine learning techniques, our model reaches an accuracy of 98.73 percent when identifying traffic congestion caused by football games. Our approach first encodes the traffic across a region as a scaled image. After that the image data from different timestamps is fused with event- and time-related data. Then a crossover operator is used as a data augmentation method to generate training datasets with more balanced classes. Finally, we use the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to tune the sensitivity of the classifier. We present the analysis of the training time and the inference time separately.			arxiv	['Abhishek Dubey', 'Jules White']	299.0

Every minute, it is estimated that the world loses forest cover the size of 48 football fields. Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest has led to drastically reduced biodiversity, loss of habitat, climate change, and other biological losses. In this respect, it has become essential to track how the nature of these forests change over time. Image classification using deep learning can help speed up this process by removing the manual task of classifying each image. Here, it is shown how convolutional neural networks can be used to track changes in land patterns in the Amazon rainforests. In this work, a testing accuracy of 96.71% was obtained. This can help governments and other agencies to track changes in land patterns more effectively and accurately.			arxiv	['Soumyadeep Debnath', 'Dhiman Mondal']	300.0

Previous efforts to make webpage content manipulable by third-party software components in browsers or desktop applications have generally relied upon specialized instrumentation included in the webpages -- a practice that neither scales well nor applies to pre-existing webpages. In contrast, Reagent automatically captures semantic details and semantically-meaningful mouse events from arbitrary webpages that contain no pre-existing special instrumentation. Reagent combines these events with text transcriptions of user speech to derive and execute parameterized commands representing human intent. Thus, users may request various visualization or analytic operations to be performed on data displayed on a page by speaking to it and/or pointing to elements within it. When unable to infer translations between event labels and human terminology, Reagent proactively asks users for definitions and adds them to its dictionary. We demonstrate Reagent in the context of a collection of pre-existing webpages that contain football team and player statistics.			arxiv	['Jeffery Kephart', 'Hui Su']	301.0

(2019) proposed the concept of rankability, which refers to a dataset's inherent ability to produce a meaningful ranking of its items. In the same paper, they proposed a rankability measure that is based on a integer program for computing the minimum number of edge changes made to a directed graph in order to obtain a complete dominance graph, i.e., an acyclic tournament graph. In this article, we prove a spectral-degree characterization of complete dominance graphs and apply this characterization to produce a new measure of rankability that is cost-effective and more widely applicable. We support the details of our algorithm with several results regarding the conditioning of the Laplacian spectrum of complete dominance graphs and the Hausdorff distance between their Laplacian spectrum and that of an arbitrary directed graph with weights between zero and one. Finally, we analyze the rankability of datasets from the world of chess and college football.			arxiv	['Amy N. Langville', 'Heather C. Smith']	302.0

Meanwhile, only cognitive consistency within a neighborhood matters because humans only interact directly with their neighbors. Inspired by these observations, we take the first step to introduce \emph{neighborhood cognitive consistency} (NCC) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Our NCC design is quite general and can be easily combined with existing MARL methods. As examples, we propose neighborhood cognition consistent deep Q-learning and Actor-Critic to facilitate large-scale multi-agent cooperations. Extensive experiments on several challenging tasks (i.e., packet routing, wifi configuration, and Google football player control) justify the superior performance of our methods compared with state-of-the-art MARL approaches.			arxiv	['Wulong Liu', 'Jianye Hao', 'Jun Luo', 'Dong Li', 'Zhengchao Zhang', 'Jun Wang', 'Zhen Xiao']	303.0
836	Multi-stream Data Analytics for Enhanced Performance Prediction in Fantasy Football	Nicholas Bonello	2019-12-16 15:24:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07441v1	Fantasy Premier League (FPL) performance predictors tend to base their algorithms purely on historical statistical data. The main problems with this approach is that external factors such as injuries, managerial decisions and other tournament match statistics can never be factored into the final predictions. In this paper, we present a new method for predicting future player performances by automatically incorporating human feedback into our model. Through statistical data analysis such as previous performances, upcoming fixture difficulty ratings, betting market analysis, opinions of the general-public and experts alike via social media and web articles, we can improve our understanding of who is likely to perform well in upcoming matches. When tested on the English Premier League 2018/19 season, the model outperformed regular statistical predictors by over 300 points, an average of 11 points per week, ranking within the top 0.5% of players rank 30,000 out of over 6.5 million players.			arxiv	['Joeran Beel', 'Seamus Lawless', 'Jeremy Debattista']	304.0
837	Soft Q Network	Jingbin Liu	2019-12-20 01:55:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10891v2	Deep Q Network (DQN) is a very successful algorithm, yet the inherent problem of reinforcement learning, i.e. the exploit-explore balance, remains. In this work, we introduce entropy regularization into DQN and propose SQN. We find that the backup equation of soft Q learning can enjoy the corrective feedback if we view the soft backup as policy improvement in the form of Q, instead of policy evaluation. We show that Soft Q Learning with Corrective Feedback (SQL-CF) underlies the on-plicy nature of SQL and the equivalence of SQL and Soft Policy Gradient (SPG). With these insights, we propose an on-policy version of deep Q learning algorithm, i.e. Q On-Policy (QOP). We experiment with QOP on a self-play environment called Google Research Football (GRF). The QOP algorithm exhibits great stability and efficiency in training GRF agents.			arxiv	['Shuai Liu', 'Xinyang Gu']	305.0

Din-Houn Lau	2013-07-02 16:08:50	http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0742v7	A system to update estimates from a sequence of probability distributions is presented. The aim of the system is to quickly produce estimates with a user-specified bound on the Monte Carlo error. The estimates are based upon weighted samples stored in a database. The stored samples are maintained such that the accuracy of the estimates and quality of the samples is satisfactory. This maintenance involves varying the number of samples in the database and updating their weights. New samples are generated, when required, by a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The system is demonstrated using a football league model that is used to predict the end of season table. Correctness of the estimates and their accuracy is shown in a simulation using a linear Gaussian model.			arxiv	['Axel Gandy']	306.0
839	Dynamical Systems Trees	Andrew Howard	2012-07-11 14:56:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4148v1	We propose dynamical systems trees (DSTs) as a flexible class of models for describing multiple processes that interact via a hierarchy of aggregating parent chains. DSTs extend Kalman filters, hidden Markov models and nonlinear dynamical systems to an interactive group scenario. Various individual processes interact as communities and sub-communities in a tree structure that is unrolled in time. To accommodate nonlinear temporal activity, each individual leaf process is modeled as a dynamical system containing discrete and/or continuous hidden states with discrete and/or Gaussian emissions. Subsequent higher level parent processes act like hidden Markov models and mediate the interaction between leaf processes or between other parent processes in the hierarchy. Aggregator chains are parents of child processes that they combine and mediate, yielding a compact overall parameterization. We provide tractable inference and learning algorithms for arbitrary DST topologies via an efficient structured mean-field algorithm. The diverse applicability of DSTs is demonstrated by experiments on gene expression data and by modeling group behavior in the setting of an American football game.			arxiv	['Tony S. Jebara']	307.0

We take into account the contributions from the football, triangle, box, and crossed diagrams with the 2$\phi$ exchange and one-loop corrections to the contact terms. We notice that the total 2$\phi$-exchange potential alone is attractive in the small momentum region in the channel ${\bar B \bar B}^{I=1}$, ${\bar B_s \bar B_s}^{I=0}$, or ${\bar B \bar B_s}^{I=1/2}$, while repulsive in the channel ${\bar B \bar B}^{I=0}$. Hopefully the analytical chiral structures of the potentials may be useful in the extrapolation of the heavy meson interaction from lattice QCD simulation.			arxiv	['Ning Li', 'Shi-Lin Zhu']	308.0

Marshall	2013-03-18 18:24:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5604v2	"Repulsive gravity has its origin in the 1939 article of Oppenheimer and Snyder which describes a collapsar, that is an idealized star of non-interacting material (dust) collapsing under its own gravity. The stellar material has a final state resembling a football, that is a significant part of it is concentrated in a thin surface shell. An interior pressure is exerted by the strong gravitational field, equivalent to a negative mass. However, the OS solution has been misunderstood, the shell's position being incorrectly identified with the ""event horizon"" in black-hole theory. While half the material is concentrated in a shell occupying a small fraction of the radius, some material is spread throughout the interior, unlike the concentration in a black hole's singularity. We deal with the singularity in density at the shell surface, by including Fermi pressure of degenerate electrons for a shell density comparable to a solar mass-sized white dwarf. Because the high-density region is concentrated in a shell, instead of at the centre as in a black hole, our conclusion is that repulsive gravity enables the existence of supermassive white dwarfs."			arxiv	['Max K.

842	A simple Bayesian procedure for forecasting the outcomes of the UEFA Champions League matches	Jean-Louis Foulley	2015-01-23 15:30:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05831v2	This article presents a Bayesian implementation of a cumulative probit model to forecast the outcomes of the UEFA Champions League matches. The argument of the normal CDF involves a cut-off point, a home vs away playing effect and the difference in strength of the two competing teams. Team strength is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution the expectation of which is expressed as a linear regression on an external rating of the team from eg the UEFA Club Ranking (UEFACR) or the Football Club World Ranking (FCWR). Priors on these parameters are updated at the beginning of each season from their posterior distributions obtained at the end of the previous one. This allows making predictions of match results for each phase of the competition: group stage and knock-out. An application is presented for the 2013-2014 season. Adjustment based on the FCWR performs better than on UEFACR.			arxiv	[]	310.0
843	A Comparative Analysis of Social Network Pages by Interests of Their Followers	Elena Mikhalkova	2017-07-18 05:49:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05481v2	Being a matter of cognition, user interests should be apt to classification independent of the language of users, social network and content of interest itself. To prove it, we analyze a collection of English and Russian Twitter and Vkontakte community pages by interests of their followers. First, we create a model of Major Interests (MaIs) with the help of expert analysis and then classify a set of pages using machine learning algorithms (SVM, Neural Network, Naive Bayes, and some other). We take three interest domains that are typical of both English and Russian-speaking communities: football, rock music, vegetarianism. The results of classification show a greater correlation between Russian-Vkontakte and Russian-Twitter pages while English-Twitterpages appear to provide the highest score.			arxiv	['Nadezhda Ganzherli', 'Yuri Karyakin']	311.0
844	An Exact Approach for the Balanced k-Way Partitioning Problem with Weight Constraints and its Application to Sports Team Realignment	Diego Recalde	2017-09-05 14:55:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01433v1	In this work a balanced k-way partitioning problem with weight constraints is defined to model the sports team realignment. Sports teams must be partitioned into a fixed number of groups according to some regulations, where the total distance of the road trips that all teams must travel to play a Double Round Robin Tournament in each group is minimized. Two integer programming formulations for this problem are introduced, and the validity of three families of inequalities associated to the polytope of these formulations is proved. The performance of a tabu search procedure and a Branch & Cut algorithm, which uses the valid inequalities as cuts, is evaluated over simulated and real-world instances. In particular, an optimal solution for the realignment of the Ecuadorian Football league is reported and the methodology can be suitable adapted for the realignment of other sports leagues.			arxiv	['Daniel Severín', 'Ramiro Torres', 'Polo Vaca']	312.0
845	Fiber-Flux Diffusion Density for White Matter Tracts Analysis: Application to Mild Anomalies Localization in Contact Sports Players	Itay Benou	2017-09-18 18:54:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06122v1	We present the concept of fiber-flux density for locally quantifying white matter (WM) fiber bundles. By combining scalar diffusivity measures (e.g., fractional anisotropy) with fiber-flux measurements, we define new local descriptors called Fiber-Flux Diffusion Density (FFDD) vectors. Applying each descriptor throughout fiber bundles allows along-tract coupling of a specific diffusion measure with geometrical properties, such as fiber orientation and coherence. A key step in the proposed framework is the construction of an FFDD dissimilarity measure for sub-voxel alignment of fiber bundles, based on the fast marching method (FMM). The obtained aligned WM tract-profiles enable meaningful inter-subject comparisons and group-wise statistical analysis. We demonstrate our method using two different datasets of contact sports players. Along-tract pairwise comparison as well as group-wise analysis, with respect to non-player healthy controls, reveal significant and spatially-consistent FFDD anomalies. Comparing our method with along-tract FA analysis shows improved sensitivity to subtle structural anomalies in football players over standard FA measurements.			arxiv	['Ronel Veksler', 'Alon Friedman', 'Tammy Riklin Raviv']	313.0

After a historical introduction, a number of problems in a variety of different fields are discussed, with the intention of giving an overall impression of the current status of mathematical physics, particularly in the topical fields of classical general relativity, cosmology and the quantum realm. This list is motivated by the recent article proposing 42 fundamental questions (in physics) which must be answered on the road to full enlightenment. But paraphrasing a famous quote by the British football manager Bill Shankly, in response to the question of whether mathematics can answer the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything, mathematics is, of course, much more important than that.			arxiv	[]	314.0
847	Analysis of association football playing styles: an innovative method to cluster networks	Jacopo Diquigiovanni	2018-05-28 14:18:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10933v2	In this work we develop an innovative hierarchical clustering method to divide a sample of undirected weighted networks into groups. The methodology consists of two phases: the first phase is aimed at putting the single networks in a broader framework by including the characteristics of the population in the data, while the second phase creates a subdivision of the sample on the basis of the similarity between the community structures of the processed networks. Starting from the representation of the team's playing style as a network, we apply the method to group the Italian Serie A teams' performances and consequently detect the main 15 tactics shown during the 2015-2016 season. The information obtained is used to verify the effect of the styles of play on the number of goals scored, and we prove the key role of one of them by implementing an extension of the Dixon and Coles model (Dixon and Coles, 1997).			arxiv	['Bruno Scarpa']	315.0

In this paper, we demonstrate how model-based curve clustering of observed player trajectories can be used to identify the routes run by eligible receivers on offensive passing plays. We use a Bernstein polynomial basis function to represent cluster centers, and the Expectation Maximization algorithm to learn the route labels for each of the 34,698 routes run on the 6,963 passing plays in the data set. We go on to suggest ideas for new potential receiver metrics that account for receiver deployment. The resulting route labels can also be paired with film to enable streamlined queries of game film.			arxiv	['Matthew Reyers', 'James Thomson', 'Lucas Wu']	316.0
849	Bayesian Hierarchical Models for the Prediction of Volleyball Results	Andrea Gabrio	2019-11-20 09:46:10	http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08791v1	Statistical modelling of sports data has become more and more popular in the recent years and different types of models have been proposed to achieve a variety of objectives: from identifying the key characteristics which lead a team to win or lose to predicting the outcome of a game or the team rankings in national leagues. Although not as popular as football or basketball, volleyball is a team sport with both national and international level competitions in almost every country. However, there is almost no study investigating the prediction of volleyball game outcomes and team rankings in national leagues. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for the prediction of the rankings of volleyball national teams, which also allows to estimate the results of each match in the league. We consider two alternative model specifications of different complexity which are validated using data from the women's volleyball Italian Serie A1 2017-2018 season.			arxiv	[]	317.0
850	Accumulator Bet Selection Through Stochastic Diffusion Search	Nassim Dehouche	2020-04-18 12:42:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08607v1	An accumulator is a bet that presents a rather unique payout structure, in that it combines multiple bets into a wager that can generate a total payout given by the multiplication of the individual odds of its parts. These potentially important returns come however at an increased risk of a loss. Indeed, the presence of a single incorrect bet in this selection would make the whole accumulator lose. The complexity of selecting a set of matches to place an accumulator bet on, as well as the number of opportunities to identify winning combinations have both dramatically increased with the easier access to online and offline bookmakers that bettors have nowadays. We address this relatively under-studied combinatorial aspect of sports betting, and propose a binary optimization model for the problem of selecting the most promising combinations of matches, in terms of their total potential payout and probability of a win, to form an accumulator bet. The results of an ongoing computational experiment, in which our model is applied to real data pertaining to the four main football leagues in the world over a complete season, are presented and compared to those of single bet selection methods.			arxiv	[]	318.0
851	Identification of skill in an online game: The case of Fantasy Premier League	Joseph D. O'Brien	2020-09-02 17:29:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01206v1	In all competitions where results are based upon an individual's performance the question of whether the outcome is a consequence of skill or luck arises. We explore this question through an analysis of a large dataset of approximately one million contestants playing Fantasy Premier League, an online fantasy sport where managers choose players from the English football (soccer) league. We show that managers' ranks over multiple seasons are correlated and we analyse the actions taken by managers to increase their likelihood of success. The prime factors in determining a manager's success are found to be long-term planning and consistently good decision-making in the face of the noisy contests upon which this game is based. Similarities between managers' decisions over time that result in the emergence of 'template' teams, suggesting a form of herding dynamics taking place within the game, are also observed. Taken together, these findings indicate common strategic considerations and consensus among successful managers on crucial decision points over an extended temporal period.			arxiv	"['James P.

852	Locational Marginal Pricing: Towards a Free Market in Power	Martin Higgins	2021-03-05 09:57:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10937v1	Nothing has done more to empower the free market, enterprise, and meritocracy than the spread of electricity and power to everyone. The power system has been the precursor to the greatest period of innovation in our history and has meant that visionaries with revolutionary ideas can compete with those with capital, political power, and means. Electricity, therefore, has been the great equalising force of the last 150 years, enhancing the productivity of the masses and granting prosperity to whole swathes of our nation. Whilst electricity has been one of the single largest innovations in enhancing the power of free markets, it is somewhat ironic that the way power is sold to consumers is largely unfree. The market is highly regulated, centralised, and is often used for political football by cynical politicians on both sides of the political spectrum. Introducing Locational Marginal Pricing into the UK grid system will increase economic freedom in the consumer markets for power, reduce prices for the poorest in the UK, decrease transmission losses, increase the permeation of low carbon generation in the grid, and incentivise investment in the UK's Northern Powerhouse initiative.			arxiv	[]	320.0
853	The reaction to news in live betting	Marius Ötting	2021-07-15 08:43:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00821v2	Sports betting markets have grown very rapidly recently, with the total European gambling market worth 98.6 billion euro in 2019. Considering a high-resolution (1 Hz) data set provided by a large European bookmaker, we investigate the effect of news on the dynamics of live betting. In particular, we consider stakes placed in a live betting market during football matches. Accounting for the general market activity level within a state-space modelling framework, we focus on the market's response to events such as goals (i.e. major news), but also to the general situation within a match such as the uncertainty about the outcome. Our results indicate that markets might overreact to recent news, confirming cognitive biases known from psychology and behavioural economics.			arxiv	['Rouven Michels', 'Roland Langrock', 'Christian Deutscher']	321.0

The agent, MimicBot, is implemented using a specifically designed deep policy network and trained using a combination of imitation and reinforcement learning. Previous attempts in using a reinforcement learning approach in such context failed for a number of reasons, e.g. due to the intrinsic randomness in the environment and the large and uneven number of actions available, with a curriculum learning approach failing to consistently beat a randomly paying agent. Currently no machine learning approach can beat a scripted bot which makes use of the domain knowledge on the game. Our solution, thanks to an imitation learning and a hybrid decision-making process, consistently beat such scripted agents. Moreover we shed lights on how to more efficiently train in a reinforcement learning setting while drastically increasing sample efficiency. MimicBot is the winner of the Bot Bowl III competition, and it is currently the state-of-the-art solution.			arxiv	[]	322.0

Specifically, some work has been done to this effect in the RoboCup humanoid football domain, but results that are performant and efficient and still generally applicable outside of this domain are lacking. We propose an approach conceptually different from those taken previously. It is based on semantic segmentation and does achieve these desired properties. In detail, it is being able to process full VGA images in real-time on a low-power mobile processor. It can further handle multiple image dimensions without retraining, it does not require specific domain knowledge for achieving a high frame rate and it is applicable on a minimal mobile hardware.			arxiv	['Marcus M.

Price	2019-01-30 04:20:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10666v2	The transiting planet candidate KOI 1843.03 ($0.6 R_\oplus$ radius, 4.245 hour orbital period, $0.46 M_\odot$ host star) has the shortest orbital period of any planet yet discovered. Here we show, using the first three-dimensional interior structure simulations of ultra-short-period tidally distorted rocky exoplanets, that KOI 1843.03 may be shaped like an American football, elongated along the planet-star axis with an aspect ratio of up to 1.79. Furthermore, for KOI 1843.03 to have avoided tidal disruption (wherein the planet is pulled apart by the tidal gravity of its host star) on such a close-in orbit, KOI 1843.03 must be as iron-rich as Mercury (about 66% by mass iron compared to Mercury's 70% by mass iron, Hauck et al. 2013). Of the ultra-short-period ($P_\mathrm{orb} \lesssim 1$ day) planets with physically-meaningful constraints on their densities characterized to date, just under half (4 out of 9) are iron-enhanced. As more are discovered, we will better understand the diversity of rocky planet compositions and the variety of processes that lead to planetary iron enhancement.			arxiv	['Leslie A. Rogers']	324.0

This is one of the fundamental problems in sport analytics, where the very simple and popular, non-trivial algorithm was proposed by Arpad Elo in late fifties to rate chess players. In this work we explain the mathematical model underlying the Elo algorithm and, in particular, we explain what is the implicit but not yet spelled out, assumption about the model of draws. We further extend the model to provide flexibility and remove the unrealistic implicit assumptions of the Elo algorithm. This yields the new rating algorithm, we call $\kappa$-Elo, which is equally simple as the Elo algorithm but provides a possibility to adjust to the frequency of draws. The discussion of the importance of the appropriate choice of the parameters is carried out and illustrated using results from English Premier League football seasons.			arxiv	['Aymen Djebbi']	325.0

The standard seeding system based on coefficients measuring the historical performance of the teams is shown to be unfair as it might potentially punish a team for its better results by having to face stronger opponents on average in the next stage. Major football competitions are revealed to suffer from this weakness. Incentive compatibility can be guaranteed by providing each qualified team with the highest coefficient of all teams that are ranked lower in its qualifying tournament for seeding purposes. Our proposal is illustrated by the 2020/21 UEFA Champions League.			arxiv	[]	326.0

Synchronous methods enjoy training stability while having lower data throughput. In contrast, asynchronous methods achieve high throughput but suffer from stability issues and lower sample efficiency due to `stale policies.' To combine the advantages of both methods we propose High-Throughput Synchronous Deep Reinforcement Learning (HTS-RL). In HTS-RL, we perform learning and rollouts concurrently, devise a system design which avoids `stale policies' and ensure that actors interact with environment replicas in an asynchronous manner while maintaining full determinism. We evaluate our approach on Atari games and the Google Research Football environment. Compared to synchronous baselines, HTS-RL is 2-6$\times$ faster. Compared to state-of-the-art asynchronous methods, HTS-RL has competitive throughput and consistently achieves higher average episode rewards.			arxiv	['Raymond A. Yeh', 'Alexander G. Schwing']	327.0

Deep neural network algorithms, as a powerful engine, can handle this problem if they are trained over an appropriate dataset.

By building a strong object-centric inductive bias into neural architectures, recent efforts have improved generalization and data efficiency of machine learning algorithms for these problems. One problem class involving relational reasoning that still remains under-explored is multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Here we investigate whether object-centric representations are also beneficial in the fully cooperative MARL setting. Specifically, we study two ways of incorporating an agent-centric inductive bias into our RL algorithm: 1. Introducing an agent-centric attention module with explicit connections across agents 2. Adding an agent-centric unsupervised predictive objective (i.e. not using action labels), to be used as an auxiliary loss for MARL, or as the basis of a pre-training step. We evaluate these approaches on the Google Research Football environment as well as DeepMind Lab 2D. Empirically, agent-centric representation learning leads to the emergence of more complex cooperation strategies between agents as well as enhanced sample efficiency and generalization.			arxiv	['Lasse Espeholt', 'Anton Raichuk', 'Tim Salimans']	330.0

To evaluate the performance of artificial intelligence agents, it is natural to evaluate them on the same Elo scale as humans, such as the rating of 5185 attributed to AlphaGo Zero. There are several fundamental differences between humans and AI that suggest modifications to the system, which in turn require revisiting Elo's fundamental rationale. AI is typically trained on many more games than humans play, and we have little a-priori information on newly created AI agents. Further, AI is being extended into games which are asymmetric between the players, and which could even have large complex boards with different setup in every game, such as commercial paper strategy games. We present a revised rating system, and guidelines for tournaments, to reflect these differences.			arxiv	[]	331.0
864	Poisson Modeling and Predicting English Premier League Goal Scoring	Quang Nguyen	2021-05-20 16:28:20	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09881v2	The English Premier League is well-known for being not only one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the world, but also one of the toughest competitions to predict. The first purpose of this research was to verify the consistency between goal scoring in the English Premier League and the Poisson process; specifically, the relationships between the number of goals scored in a match and the Poisson distribution, the time between goals throughout the course of a season and the exponential distribution, and the time location of goals during football games and the continuous uniform distribution. We found that the Poisson process and the three probability distributions accurately describe Premier League goal scoring. In addition, Poisson regression was utilized to predict outcomes for a Premier League season, using different sets of season data and with a large number of simulations being involved. We examined and compared various soccer metrics from our simulation results, including an English club's chances of being the champions, finishing in the top four and bottom three, and relegation points.			arxiv	[]	332.0
865	The Earth Mover's Pinball Loss: Quantiles for Histogram-Valued Regression	Florian List	2021-06-03 18:00:04	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02051v1	Although ubiquitous in the sciences, histogram data have not received much attention by the Deep Learning community. Whilst regression and classification tasks for scalar and vector data are routinely solved by neural networks, a principled approach for estimating histogram labels as a function of an input vector or image is lacking in the literature. We present a dedicated method for Deep Learning-based histogram regression, which incorporates cross-bin information and yields distributions over possible histograms, expressed by $\tau$-quantiles of the cumulative histogram in each bin. The crux of our approach is a new loss function obtained by applying the pinball loss to the cumulative histogram, which for 1D histograms reduces to the Earth Mover's distance (EMD) in the special case of the median ($\tau = 0.5$), and generalizes it to arbitrary quantiles. We validate our method with an illustrative toy example, a football-related task, and an astrophysical computer vision problem. We show that with our loss function, the accuracy of the predicted median histograms is very similar to the standard EMD case (and higher than for per-bin loss functions such as cross-entropy), while the predictions become much more informative at almost no additional computational cost.			arxiv	[]	333.0
866	Celebrating Diversity in Shared Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning	Chenghao Li	2021-06-04 00:55:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02195v2	Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown the promise to solve complex cooperative tasks. Its success is partly because of parameter sharing among agents. However, such sharing may lead agents to behave similarly and limit their coordination capacity. In this paper, we aim to introduce diversity in both optimization and representation of shared multi-agent reinforcement learning. Specifically, we propose an information-theoretical regularization to maximize the mutual information between agents' identities and their trajectories, encouraging extensive exploration and diverse individualized behaviors. In representation, we incorporate agent-specific modules in the shared neural network architecture, which are regularized by L1-norm to promote learning sharing among agents while keeping necessary diversity. Empirical results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Google Research Football and super hard StarCraft II micromanagement tasks.			arxiv	['Tonghan Wang', 'Chengjie Wu', 'Qianchuan Zhao', 'Jun Yang', 'Chongjie Zhang']	334.0

Existing news recommendation methods usually learn a single user embedding for each user from their previous behaviors to represent their overall interest. However, user interest is usually diverse and multi-grained, which is difficult to be accurately modeled by a single user embedding. In this paper, we propose a news recommendation method with hierarchical user interest modeling, named HieRec. Instead of a single user embedding, in our method each user is represented in a hierarchical interest tree to better capture their diverse and multi-grained interest in news. We use a three-level hierarchy to represent 1) overall user interest; 2) user interest in coarse-grained topics like sports; and 3) user interest in fine-grained topics like football. Moreover, we propose a hierarchical user interest matching framework to match candidate news with different levels of user interest for more accurate user interest targeting. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets validate our method can effectively improve the performance of user modeling for personalized news recommendation.			arxiv	['Fangzhao Wu', 'Chuhan Wu', 'Peiru Yang', 'Yang Yu', 'Xing Xie', 'Yongfeng Huang']	335.0
868	Assessing competitive balance in the English Premier League for over forty seasons using a stochastic block model	Francesca Basini	2021-07-19 10:01:50	http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08732v2	Competitive balance is the subject of much interest in the sports analytics literature and beyond. In this paper, we develop a statistical network model based on an extension of the stochastic block model to assess the balance between teams in a league. Here we represent the outcome of all matches in a football season as a dense network with nodes identified by teams and categorical edges representing the outcome of each game as a win, draw or a loss. The main focus and motivation for this paper is to provide a statistical framework to assess the issue of competitive balance in the context of the English First Division / Premier League over more than 40 seasons. The Premier League is arguably one of the most popular leagues in the world, in terms of its global reach and the revenue which it generates. Therefore it is of wide interest to assess its competitiveness. Our analysis provides evidence suggesting a structural change around the early 2000's from a reasonably balanced league to a two-tier league.			arxiv	['Vasiliki Tsouli', 'Ioannis Ntzoufras', 'Nial Friel']	336.0

Prior works are constrained mainly by the assumption that all agents act simultaneously, and asynchronous action coordination between agents is rarely considered. This paper introduces a bi-level multi-agent decision hierarchy for coordinated behavior planning. We propose a novel election mechanism in which we adopt a graph convolutional network to model the interaction among agents and elect a first-move agent for asynchronous guidance. We also propose a dynamically weighted mixing network to effectively reduce the misestimation of the value function during training. This work is the first to explicitly model the asynchronous multi-agent action coordination, and this explicitness enables to choose the optimal first-move agent. The results on Cooperative Navigation and Google Football demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve superior performance in cooperative environments.

Different from its single-agent counterpart, distributed value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning faces the unique challenges of demanding data transfer, inter-process communication management, and high requirement of exploration. We propose a containerized learning framework to solve these problems. We pack several environment instances, a local learner and buffer, and a carefully designed multi-queue manager which avoids blocking into a container. Local policies of each container are encouraged to be as diverse as possible, and only trajectories with highest priority are sent to a global learner. In this way, we achieve a scalable, time-efficient, and diverse distributed MARL learning framework with high system throughput. To own knowledge, our method is the first to solve the challenging Google Research Football full game $5\_v\_5$. On the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark, our method gets $4$-$18\times$ better results compared to state-of-the-art non-distributed MARL algorithms.			arxiv	['Tonghan Wang', 'Chenghao Li', 'Yang Hu', 'Chongjie Zhang']	338.0
871	The effects of draw restrictions on knockout tournaments	László Csató	2021-10-26 12:47:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13641v5	The paper analyses how draw constraints influence the outcome of a knockout tournament. The research question is inspired by European club football competitions, where the organiser generally imposes an association constraint in the first round of the knockout phase: teams from the same country cannot be drawn against each other. Its effects are explored in both theoretical and simulation models. An association constraint in the first round(s) is found to increase the likelihood of same nation matchups to approximately the same extent in each subsequent round. If the favourite teams are concentrated in some associations, they will have a higher probability to win the tournament under this policy but the increase is less than linear if it is used in more rounds. Our results might explain the recent introduction of the association constraint for both the knockout round play-offs with 16 teams and the Round of 16 in the UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League.			arxiv	[]	339.0

We construct a family of Kahler--Einstein edge metrics singular along two disjoint divisors on the Calabi--Hirzebruch manifolds and study their Gromov--Hausdorff limits when either cone angle tends to its extreme value. As a very special case, we show that the celebrated Eguchi--Hanson metric arises in this way naturally as a Gromov--Hausdorff limit. We also completely describe all other (possibly rescaled) Gromov--Hausdorff limits which exhibit a wide range of behaviors, resolving in this setting a conjecture of Cheltsov--Rubinstein. This gives a new interpretation of both the Eguchi--Hanson space and Calabi's Ricci flat spaces as limits of compact singular Einstein spaces.			arxiv	['Yanir A. Rubinstein', 'Kewei Zhang']	340.0
873	Hydrophilic Porous Materials as Helmet Padding Able to Prevent Traumatic Brain Injuries	J. B. Sokoloff	2021-10-28 19:03:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02786v2	"The minimum possible value of the average deceleration of the head of a player engaged in an impact sport such as football or hockey, as a result of an impact of his/her helmet with a surface or another player, is inversely proportional to the helmet padding thickness. Since there are practical limits to its maximum thickness, it is difficult to significantly reduce the average acceleration. There is evidence, however, that the peak, rather than the average, acceleration is the most significant cause of brain injury. It is proposed here that brain injuries that occur as a result of an impact, could be reduced by using as padding a hydrophilic porous material swollen with fluid. The friction experienced by the fluid as it is squeezed out of the porous material in an impact can ""tune"" the acceleration of the skull so that it is never significantly higher than its average during the impact."			arxiv	[]	341.0
874	On the role of tournament design in sporting success: A study of the North, Central American and Caribbean qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup	László Csató	2021-10-12 12:00:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03435v1	Playing in the FIFA World Cup finals is an ambition shared by several nations. Since, besides luck and skill, the probability of qualification depends on the design of the qualifiers, the study of these competitions forms an integral part of sports analytics. The Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) announced a novel qualifying format for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in July 2019. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the organisers to return to a more traditional structure. The present chapter analyses how this reform impacted the chances of the national teams to qualify. It is found that the probability of participating in the FIFA World Cup finals can change by more than 5 percentage points under the assumption of fixed strengths for the teams. The idea behind the original design, to divide the contestants into two distinct sets, is worth considering due to the increased competitiveness of the matches played by the strongest and the weakest teams. We recommend mitigating the sharp nonlinearity caused by the seeding policy via a probabilistic rule to the analogy of the NBA draft lottery system.			arxiv	[]	342.0
875	GCS: Graph-based Coordination Strategy for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning	Jingqing Ruan	2022-01-17 07:47:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06257v1	Many real-world scenarios involve a team of agents that have to coordinate their policies to achieve a shared goal. Previous studies mainly focus on decentralized control to maximize a common reward and barely consider the coordination among control policies, which is critical in dynamic and complicated environments. In this work, we propose factorizing the joint team policy into a graph generator and graph-based coordinated policy to enable coordinated behaviours among agents. The graph generator adopts an encoder-decoder framework that outputs directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to capture the underlying dynamic decision structure. We also apply the DAGness-constrained and DAG depth-constrained optimization in the graph generator to balance efficiency and performance. The graph-based coordinated policy exploits the generated decision structure. The graph generator and coordinated policy are trained simultaneously to maximize the discounted return. Empirical evaluations on Collaborative Gaussian Squeeze, Cooperative Navigation, and Google Research Football demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.			arxiv	['Yali Du', 'Xuantang Xiong', 'Dengpeng Xing', 'Xiyun Li', 'Linghui Meng', 'Haifeng Zhang', 'Jun Wang', 'Bo Xu']	343.0
876	Transfer Portal: Accurately Forecasting the Impact of a Player Transfer in Soccer	Daniel Dinsdale	2022-01-27 14:15:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11533v1	One of the most important and challenging problems in football is predicting future player performance when transferred to another club within and between different leagues. In addition to being the most valuable prediction a team makes, it is also the most complex analytics task to perform as it needs to take into consideration: a) differences in playing style between the player's current team and target team, b) differences in style and ability of other players on each team, c) differences in league quality and style, and d) the role the player is desired to play. In this paper, we present a method which addresses these issues and enables us to make accurate predictions of future performance. Our Transfer Portal model utilizes a personalized neural network accounting for both stylistic and ability level input representations for players, teams, and leagues to simulate future player performance at any chosen club. Furthermore, we use a Bayesian updating framework to dynamically modify player and team representations over time which enables us to generate predictions for rising stars with small amounts of data.			arxiv	['Joe Gallagher']	344.0

Who's there? -- Identifying football player jersey numbers with synthetic data	Divya Bhargavi	2022-03-01 20:44:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00734v2	Automatic player identification is an essential and complex task in sports video analysis. Different strategies have been devised over the years, but identification based on jersey numbers is one of the most common approaches given its versatility and relative simplicity. However, automatic detection of jersey numbers is still challenging due to changing camera angles, low video resolution, small object size in wide-range shots and transient changes in the player's posture and movement. In this paper we present a novel approach for jersey number identification in a small, highly imbalanced dataset from the Seattle Seahawks practice videos. Our results indicate that simple models can achieve an acceptable performance on the jersey number detection task and that synthetic data can improve the performance dramatically (accuracy increase of ~9% overall, ~18% on low frequency numbers) making our approach achieve state of the art results.			arxiv	['Erika Pelaez Coyotl', 'Sia Gholami']	345.0
878	"UEFA EURO 2020: a ""pure game of chance""?"	Giulia Fedrizzi	2022-03-14 22:34:57	http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07531v1	"We analysed the distribution of the number of goals scored in each of the 51 football matches played in the UEFA EURO 2020 final phase as well as the waiting times between scores (also considering censored times). We found that the Poisson model fits the score data and the exponential distribution fits waiting times quite well. Such a good fit could be considered somewhat counterintuitive and unrealistic given the memoryless property of the exponential model. However, some peculiar features of this study have to be considered: the abilities of the teams were relatively homogeneous; the time span was short; there was no distinction between home and away games; only the total number of goals scored in each game was considered. Although UEFA EURO 2020 can certainly not be considered a ""pure game of chance"", this competition can be seen as an intriguing example of the pervasive real-world ubiquity of the concept of independence and its ability to encompass complex situations in a single, parsimonious model."			arxiv	['Luisa Canal', 'Rocco Micciolo']	346.0

Our regression model incorporates the Elo points of the participating teams, the location of the matches and the of team-specific skills in attack and defense as covariates. The proposed model allows predictions in terms of probabilities in order to quantify the chances for each team to reach a certain stage of the tournament. We use Monte Carlo simulations for estimating the outcome of each single match of the tournament, from which we are able to simulate the whole tournament itself. The model is fitted on all football games of the participating teams since 2016 weighted by date and importance. Validation with previous tournaments and comparison with other Poisson models are given.			arxiv	[]	347.0
880	Exploring Local Explanations of Nonlinear Models Using Animated Linear Projections	Nicholas Spyrison	2022-05-11 09:11:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05359v2	The increased predictive power of machine learning models comes at the cost of increased complexity and loss of interpretability, particularly in comparison to parametric statistical models. This trade-off has led to the emergence of eXplainable AI (XAI) which provides methods, such as local explanations (LEs) and local variable attributions (LVAs), to shed light on how a model use predictors to arrive at a prediction. These provide a point estimate of the linear variable importance in the vicinity of a single observation. However, LVAs tend not to effectively handle association between predictors. To understand how the interaction between predictors affects the variable importance estimate, we can convert LVAs into linear projections and use the radial tour. This is also useful for learning how a model has made a mistake, or the effect of outliers, or the clustering of observations. The approach is illustrated with examples from categorical (penguin species, chocolate types) and quantitative (soccer/football salaries, house prices) response models. The methods are implemented in the R package cheem, available on CRAN.			arxiv	['Dianne Cook', 'Przemyslaw Biecek']	348.0
881	On the extent of collusion created by tie-breaking rules	László Csató	2022-06-08 15:27:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03961v6	Games played in the final round of a round-robin contest may inspire collusion and match-fixing if there exists a result allowing both teams to advance. Our paper reveals that using head-to-head records as the primary tie-breaking principle might lead to such situations and identifies all possible cases in a single round-robin tournament with four teams. According to our simulations based on the UEFA European Football Championship, the official tie-breaking policy increases the probability of collusion opportunities by 25-30 percentage points. This makes the risk of collusion more threatening than in a round-robin contest with three teams. The danger can scarcely be mitigated by an optimal match schedule.			arxiv	[]	349.0

Coefficient-based amounts are paid such that the participating teams are ranked on the basis of performances over the last 10 years. Due to the non-anonymity of this allocation rule, all clubs are interested in qualification together with lower-ranked teams, which makes the procedure incentive incompatible. In particular, the English club Arsenal is found to lose 132 thousand Euros prize money in the 2022/23 UEFA Europa League because of exerting full effort in its domestic championship. Two strategy-proof alternatives are proposed to divide fairly this pillar of the revenue distribution system.			arxiv	[]	350.0

One of its main features is making full use of the global information to learn a better joint $Q$-function or centralized critic. In this paper, we in turn explore how to leverage the global information to directly learn a better individual $Q$-function or individual actor. We find that applying the same global information to all agents indiscriminately is not enough for good performance, and thus propose to specify the global information for each agent to obtain agent-specific global information for better performance. Furthermore, we distill such agent-specific global information into the agent's local information, which is used during decentralized execution without too much performance degradation. We call this new paradigm Personalized Training with Distillated Execution (PTDE). PTDE can be easily combined with many state-of-the-art algorithms to further improve their performance, which is verified in both SMAC and Google Research Football scenarios.			arxiv	['Hangyu Mao', 'Tianle Zhang', 'Shiguang Wu', 'Bin Zhang', 'Jianye Hao', 'Dong Li', 'Bin Wang', 'Hongxing Chang']	353.0
886	Group Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning with Hierarchical Latent Variables	Mengdi Xu	2022-10-21 21:34:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12262v1	One key challenge for multi-task Reinforcement learning (RL) in practice is the absence of task indicators. Robust RL has been applied to deal with task ambiguity, but may result in over-conservative policies. To balance the worst-case (robustness) and average performance, we propose Group Distributionally Robust Markov Decision Process (GDR-MDP), a flexible hierarchical MDP formulation that encodes task groups via a latent mixture model. GDR-MDP identifies the optimal policy that maximizes the expected return under the worst-possible qualified belief over task groups within an ambiguity set. We rigorously show that GDR-MDP's hierarchical structure improves distributional robustness by adding regularization to the worst possible outcomes. We then develop deep RL algorithms for GDR-MDP for both value-based and policy-based RL methods. Extensive experiments on Box2D control tasks, MuJoCo benchmarks, and Google football platforms show that our algorithms outperform classic robust training algorithms across diverse environments in terms of robustness under belief uncertainties. Demos are available on our project page (\url{https://sites.google.com/view/gdr-rl/home}).			arxiv	['Peide Huang', 'Yaru Niu', 'Visak Kumar', 'Jielin Qiu', 'Chao Fang', 'Kuan-Hui Lee', 'Xuewei Qi', 'Henry Lam', 'Bo Li', 'Ding Zhao']	354.0

When M is dimension up to seven and the space of leaves of the characteristic foliation is well-formed, we first show that any solution of the Sasaki-Ricci flow converges in the Cheeger-Gromov sense to the unique singular orbifold Sasaki-Ricci soliton on the limit space which is a S^1-orbibundle over the unique singular Kaehler-Ricci soliton on a normal projective variety with codimension two orbifold singularities. Secondly, for n=1, we show that there are only two nontrivial Sasaki-Ricci solitons on a compact quasi-regular Fano Sasakian three-sphere with its leave space a teardrop-like and football-like space, respectively. For n=2,3, we show that the Sasaki-Ricci soliton is trivial one if M is transverse K-stable.			arxiv	['Shu-Cheng Chang', 'Yingbo Han', 'Chien Lin', 'Chin-Tung Wu']	355.0

The past decade's advances in rl have led to breakthroughs in many challenging domains such as video games, board games, robotics, and chip design. The sample inefficiency of deep reinforcement learning methods is a significant obstacle when applying rl to real-world problems. Transfer learning has been applied to reinforcement learning such that the knowledge gained in one task can be applied when training in a new task. Curriculum learning is concerned with sequencing tasks or data samples such that knowledge can be transferred between those tasks to learn a target task that would otherwise be too difficult to solve. Designing a curriculum that improves sample efficiency is a complex problem. In this thesis, we propose a teacher-student curriculum learning setting where we simultaneously train a teacher that selects tasks for the student while the student learns how to solve the selected task. Our method is independent of human domain knowledge and manual curriculum design. We evaluated our methods on two reinforcement learning benchmarks: grid world and the challenging Google Football environment. With our method, we can improve the sample efficiency and generality of the student compared to tabula-rasa reinforcement learning.			arxiv	[]	356.0

The large distance to the camera makes it difficult to visually distinguish individual players, which adversely affects the performance of traditional solutions relying on the appearance of tracked objects. Our method focuses on individual player dynamics and interactions between neighborhood players to improve tracking performance. To overcome the difficulty of reliably merging detections from multiple cameras in the presence of calibration errors, we propose the novel tracking approach, where the tracker operates directly on raw detection heat maps from multiple cameras. Our model is trained on a large synthetic dataset generated using Google Research Football Environment and fine-tuned using real-world data to reduce costs involved with ground truth preparation.			arxiv	['Grzegorz Kurzejamski']	357.0

Using a high-frequency dataset provided directly by a major bookmaker, containing the odds and amounts staked throughout German Bundesliga football matches, we test for evidence of momentum in the betting and pricing behaviour after equalising goals. We find that bettors see value in teams that have the apparent momentum, staking about 40% more on them than teams that just conceded an equaliser. Still, there is no evidence that such perceived momentum matters on average for match outcomes or is associated with the bookmaker offering favourable odds. We also confirm that betting on the apparent momentum would lead to substantial losses for bettors.			arxiv	['Christian Deutscher', 'Carl Singleton', 'Luca De Angelis']	358.0
891	Axion Free-kick Misalignment Mechanism	Ling-Xiao Xu	2022-11-23 16:03:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13074v2	We propose an alternative scenario for the axion misalignment mechanism based on the nontrivial interplay between the axion and a light dilaton in the early universe. Dark matter abundance is still sourced by the initial misalignment of the axion field, whose motion along the potential kicks the dilaton field away from its minimum, and dilaton starts to oscillate later with a delayed onset time for oscillation and a relatively large misalignment value due to the kick; eventually the dilaton dominates over the axion in their energy densities, and the dilaton is identified as dark matter. The kick effect due to axion motion is the most significant if the initial field value of dilaton is near its minimum; therefore, we call this scenario axion free-kick misalignment mechanism, where axion plays the role similar to a football player. Dark matter abundance can be obtained with a lower axion decay constant compared to the conventional misalignment mechanism.			arxiv	['Seokhoon Yun']	359.0
892	Hierarchical Strategies for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning	Majd Ibrahim	2022-12-14 18:27:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07397v1	Adequate strategizing of agents behaviors is essential to solving cooperative MARL problems. One intuitively beneficial yet uncommon method in this domain is predicting agents future behaviors and planning accordingly. Leveraging this point, we propose a two-level hierarchical architecture that combines a novel information-theoretic objective with a trajectory prediction model to learn a strategy. To this end, we introduce a latent policy that learns two types of latent strategies: individual $z_A$, and relational $z_R$ using a modified Graph Attention Network module to extract interaction features. We encourage each agent to behave according to the strategy by conditioning its local $Q$ functions on $z_A$, and we further equip agents with a shared $Q$ function that conditions on $z_R$. Additionally, we introduce two regularizers to allow predicted trajectories to be accurate and rewarding. Empirical results on Google Research Football (GRF) and StarCraft (SC) II micromanagement tasks show that our method establishes a new state of the art being, to the best of our knowledge, the first MARL algorithm to solve all super hard SC II scenarios as well as the GRF full game with a win rate higher than $95\%$, thus outperforming all existing methods.

893	Impact of the Euro 2020 championship on the spread of COVID-19	Jonas Dehning	2023-01-18 17:06:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07659v1	Large-scale events like the UEFA Euro~2020 football (soccer) championship offer a unique opportunity to quantify the impact of gatherings on the spread of COVID-19, as the number and dates of matches played by participating countries resembles a randomized study. Using Bayesian modeling and the gender imbalance in COVID-19 data, we attribute 840,000 (95% CI: [0.39M, 1.26M]) COVID-19 cases across 12 countries to the championship. The impact depends non-linearly on the initial incidence, the reproduction number $R$, and the number of matches played. The strongest effects are seen in Scotland and England, where as much as 10,000 primary cases per million inhabitants occur from championship-related gatherings. The average match-induced increase in $R$ was 0.46 [0.18, 0.75] on match days, but important matches caused an increase as large as +3. Altogether, our results provide quantitative insights that help judge and mitigate the impact of large-scale events on pandemic spread.			arxiv	['Sebastian B.

894	Sentiment Analysis for Measuring Hope and Fear from Reddit Posts During the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian Conflict	Alessio Guerra	2023-01-19 22:43:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08347v1	"This paper proposes a novel lexicon-based unsupervised sentimental analysis method to measure the $``\textit{hope}""$ and $``\textit{fear}""$ for the 2022 Ukrainian-Russian Conflict. $\textit{Reddit.com}$ is utilised as the main source of human reactions to daily events during nearly the first three months of the conflict. The top 50 $``hot""$ posts of six different subreddits about Ukraine and news (Ukraine, worldnews, Ukraina, UkrainianConflict, UkraineWarVideoReport, UkraineWarReports) and their relative comments are scraped and a data set is created. On this corpus, multiple analyses such as (1) public interest, (2) hope/fear score, (3) stock price interaction are employed. We promote using a dictionary approach, which scores the hopefulness of every submitted user post. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm of topic modelling is also utilised to understand the main issues raised by users and what are the key talking points. Experimental analysis shows that the hope strongly decreases after the symbolic and strategic losses of Azovstal (Mariupol) and Severodonetsk. Spikes in hope/fear, both positives and negatives, are present after important battles, but also some non-military events, such as Eurovision and football games."			arxiv	['Oktay Karakuş']	362.0
895	Order Matters: Agent-by-agent Policy Optimization	Xihuai Wang	2023-02-13 09:24:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06205v2	While multi-agent trust region algorithms have achieved great success empirically in solving coordination tasks, most of them, however, suffer from a non-stationarity problem since agents update their policies simultaneously. In contrast, a sequential scheme that updates policies agent-by-agent provides another perspective and shows strong performance. However, sample inefficiency and lack of monotonic improvement guarantees for each agent are still the two significant challenges for the sequential scheme. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{A}gent-by-\textbf{a}gent \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (A2PO) algorithm to improve the sample efficiency and retain the guarantees of monotonic improvement for each agent during training. We justify the tightness of the monotonic improvement bound compared with other trust region algorithms. From the perspective of sequentially updating agents, we further consider the effect of agent updating order and extend the theory of non-stationarity into the sequential update scheme. To evaluate A2PO, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on four benchmarks: StarCraftII, Multi-agent MuJoCo, Multi-agent Particle Environment, and Google Research Football full game scenarios. A2PO consistently outperforms strong baselines.			arxiv	['Zheng Tian', 'Ziyu Wan', 'Ying Wen', 'Jun Wang', 'Weinan Zhang']	363.0
896	Why winning a soccer game is worth 5 points	Leszek Szczecinski	2023-02-22 21:10:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15305v1	Ranking is used in sport leagues to determine a champion and/or to decide on promotion/relegation of teams. Arguably, the best known ranking method relies on scores obtained by cumulating the points associated with the wins and the draws of all teams, which are then ranked by sorting the score obtained. There are two main problems with this ranking method. First, the meaning of the ranking is undefined, and, second, it depends on the relative value of the wins that is arbitrarily set. We remedy these issues by introducing a probabilistic model of the game results and by showing an interpretation of the ranking that is consistent with the model. We also propose a methodology to estimate the parameter of the model which allows us to objectively determine the value of the win. In particular, using data from the association football (soccer), we show that the value of the win is close to five (5) points.			arxiv	[]	364.0

However, due to the lack of referees in many countries and the high cost of the VAR infrastructure, only professional leagues can benefit from it. In this paper, we propose a Video Assistant Referee System (VARS) that can automate soccer decision-making. VARS leverages the latest findings in multi-view video analysis, to provide real-time feedback to the referee, and help them make informed decisions that can impact the outcome of a game. To validate VARS, we introduce SoccerNet-MVFoul, a novel video dataset of soccer fouls from multiple camera views, annotated with extensive foul descriptions by a professional soccer referee, and we benchmark our VARS to automatically recognize the characteristics of these fouls. We believe that VARS has the potential to revolutionize soccer refereeing and take the game to new heights of fairness and accuracy across all levels of professional and amateur federations.			arxiv	['Anthony Cioppa', 'Silvio Giancola', 'Abdullah Hamdi', 'Bernard Ghanem', 'Marc Van Droogenbroeck']	365.0

We study the problem of extending a flat connection with logarithmic poles along $D$ from the complement $X \setminus D^s$ to all of $X$. In the setting where $D$ is a weighted homogeneous plane curve, we give a new proof of Mebkhout's theorem that extensions always exist. Our proof makes use of a Jordan decomposition for logarithmic connections as well as a version of Grothendieck's decomposition theorem for vector bundles over the `football' orbifold which is due to Martens and Thaddeus. In higher dimensions, we point out a close relationship between the extension problem and castling equivalence of prehomogeneous vector spaces. In particular, we show that the twisted fundamental groupoids of castling equivalent linear free divisors are `birationally' Morita equivalent and we use this to generate examples of non-extendable flat connections.			arxiv	[]	366.0
899	Learning to Collaborate by Grouping: a Consensus-oriented Strategy for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning	Jingqing Ruan	2023-07-28 12:41:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15530v1	Multi-agent systems require effective coordination between groups and individuals to achieve common goals. However, current multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods primarily focus on improving individual policies and do not adequately address group-level policies, which leads to weak cooperation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Consensus-oriented Strategy (CoS) that emphasizes group and individual policies simultaneously. Specifically, CoS comprises two main components: (a) the vector quantized group consensus module, which extracts discrete latent embeddings that represent the stable and discriminative group consensus, and (b) the group consensus-oriented strategy, which integrates the group policy using a hypernet and the individual policies using the group consensus, thereby promoting coordination at both the group and individual levels. Through empirical experiments on cooperative navigation tasks with both discrete and continuous spaces, as well as Google research football, we demonstrate that CoS outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and achieves better collaboration, thus providing a promising solution for achieving effective coordination in multi-agent systems.			arxiv	['Xiaotian Hao', 'Dong Li', 'Hangyu Mao']	367.0

Following this argument, we opted to fine tune a one billion parameter size trained general purpose causal language model with a dataset curated on team statistics of the Italian football league first ten game weeks, using low rank adaptation. The limited training dataset was compiled based on a framework where a powerful commercial large language model provides distilled paragraphs and question answer pairs as intended. The training duration was kept relatively short to provide a basis for our minimal setting exploration. We share our key observations on the process related to developing a specific purpose language model which is intended to interpret soccer data with constrained resources in this article.			arxiv	[]	368.0

While the computation of many intrinsic rewards relies on estimating variational posteriors using neural network approximators, a notable challenge has surfaced due to the limited expressive capability of these neural statistics approximators. We pinpoint this challenge as the ""revisitation"" issue, where agents recurrently explore confined areas of the task space. To combat this, we propose a dynamic reward scaling approach. This method is crafted to stabilize the significant fluctuations in intrinsic rewards in previously explored areas and promote broader exploration, effectively curbing the revisitation phenomenon. Our experimental findings underscore the efficacy of our approach, showcasing enhanced performance in demanding environments like Google Research Football and StarCraft II micromanagement tasks, especially in sparse reward settings."			arxiv	['Tonghan Wang', 'Chongjie Zhang', 'Qianchuan Zhao']	369.0
902	Static and Dynamic BART for Rank-Order Data	Matteo Iacopini	2023-08-20 11:26:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10231v1	Ranking lists are often provided at regular time intervals by one or multiple rankers in a range of applications, including sports, marketing, and politics. Most popular methods for rank-order data postulate a linear specification for the latent scores, which determine the observed ranks, and ignore the temporal dependence of the ranking lists. To address these issues, novel nonparametric static (ROBART) and autoregressive (ARROBART) models are introduced, with latent scores defined as nonlinear Bayesian additive regression tree functions of covariates. To make inferences in the dynamic ARROBART model, closed-form filtering, predictive, and smoothing distributions for the latent time-varying scores are derived. These results are applied in a Gibbs sampler with data augmentation for posterior inference. The proposed methods are shown to outperform existing competitors in simulation studies, and the advantages of the dynamic model are demonstrated by forecasts of weekly pollster rankings of NCAA football teams.			arxiv	"[""Eoghan O'Neill"", 'Luca Rossini']"	370.0

However, exploration still remains a challenging problem in MARL due to the partial observability of the agents and the exploration space that can grow exponentially as the number of agents increases. Firstly, in order to address the scalability issue of the exploration space, we define a formation-based equivalence relation on the exploration space and aim to reduce the search space by exploring only meaningful states in different formations. Then, we propose a novel formation-aware exploration (FoX) framework that encourages partially observable agents to visit the states in diverse formations by guiding them to be well aware of their current formation solely based on their own observations. Numerical results show that the proposed FoX framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art MARL algorithms on Google Research Football (GRF) and sparse Starcraft II multi-agent challenge (SMAC) tasks.			arxiv	['Sunwoo Lee', 'Junghyuk Yum', 'Seungyul Han']	371.0
904	Method and Validation for Optimal Lineup Creation for Daily Fantasy Football Using Machine Learning and Linear Programming	Joseph M. Mahoney	2023-09-26 20:26:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15253v2	Daily fantasy sports (DFS) are weekly or daily online contests where real-game performances of individual players are converted to fantasy points (FPTS). Users select players for their lineup to maximize their FPTS within a set player salary cap. This paper focuses on (1) the development of a method to forecast NFL player performance under uncertainty and (2) determining an optimal lineup to maximize FPTS under a set salary limit. A supervised learning neural network was created and used to project FPTS based on past player performance (2018 NFL regular season for this work) prior to the upcoming week. These projected FPTS were used in a mixed integer linear program to find the optimal lineup. The performance of resultant lineups was compared to randomly-created lineups. On average, the optimal lineups outperformed the random lineups. The generated lineups were then compared to real-world lineups from users on DraftKings. The generated lineups generally fell in approximately the 31st percentile (median). The FPTS methods and predictions presented here can be further improved using this study as a baseline comparison.			arxiv	['Tomasz B. Paniak']	372.0
905	Ratings of European and South American Football Leagues Based on Glicko-2 with Modifications	Andrei Shelopugin	2023-10-07 18:05:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11459v1	One of the key problems in the field of soccer analytics is predicting how a player performance changes when transitioning from one league to another. One potential solution to address this issue lies in the evaluation of the respective league strength. This article endeavors to compute club ratings of the first and second European and South American leagues. In order to calculate these ratings, the authors have designed the Glicko-2 rating system-based approach, which overcomes some Glicko-2 limitations. Particularly, the authors took into consideration the probability of the draw, the home-field advantage, and the property of teams to become stronger or weaker following their league transitions. Furthermore, authors have constructed a predictive model for forecasting match results based on the number of goals scored in previous matches. The metrics utilized in the analysis reveal that the Glicko-2 based approach exhibits a marginally superior level of accuracy when compared to the commonly used Poisson regression-based approach. In addition, Glicko-2 based ratings offer greater interpretability and can find application in various analytics tasks, such as predicting soccer player metrics for forthcoming seasons or the detailed analysis of a player performance in preceding matches. The implementation of the approach is available on github.com/andreyshelopugin/GlickoSoccer.			arxiv	['Alexander Sirotkin']	373.0

Efficient computation and efficacious evaluation of communities are both essential, especially in commercial and industrial settings. However, the solution space of graph partitioning increases drastically with the number of vertices and subgroups. With an eye to solving large scale graph partitioning and other optimization problems within a short period of time, the Digital Annealer (DA), a specialized CMOS hardware also featuring improved algorithms, has been devised by Fujitsu Ltd. This study gauges Fujitsu DA's performance and running times. The modularity was implemented as both the objective function and metric for the solutions. The graph partitioning problems were formatted into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) structures so that they could be adequately imported into the DA. The DA yielded the highest modularity among other studies when partitioning Karate Club, Les Miserables, American Football, and Dolphin. Moreover, the DA was able to partition the Case 1354pegase power grid network into 45 subgroups, calling for 60,930 binary variables, whilst delivering optimal modularity results within a solving time of roughly 80 seconds. Our results suggest that the Fujitsu DA can be applied for rapid and efficient optimization for graph partitioning.			arxiv	['Hsiu-Chuan Hsu']	374.0

Single-frame supervision has emerged as a labor-efficient way to train action localizers as it requires only one annotated frame per action. However, it often suffers from poor performance due to the lack of precise boundary annotations. To address this issue, we propose a visual analysis method that aligns similar actions and then propagates a few user-provided annotations (e.g. , boundaries, category labels) to similar actions via the generated alignments. Our method models the alignment between actions as a heaviest path problem and the annotation propagation as a quadratic optimization problem. As the automatically generated alignments may not accurately match the associated actions and could produce inaccurate localization results, we develop a storyline visualization to explain the localization results of actions and their alignments. This visualization facilitates users in correcting wrong localization results and misalignments. The corrections are then used to improve the localization results of other actions. The effectiveness of our method in improving localization performance is demonstrated through quantitative evaluation and a case study.			arxiv	['Jiashu Chen', 'Weikai Yang', 'Haoze Wang', 'Johannes Knittel', 'Xibin Zhao', 'Steffen Koch', 'Thomas Ertl', 'Shixia Liu']	375.0

Despite fruitful progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning, the challenge of addressing the dynamics of whether two agents should exhibit consistent behaviors is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a new approach that enables agents to learn whether their behaviors should be consistent with that of other agents by utilizing intrinsic rewards to learn the optimal policy for each agent. We begin by defining behavior consistency as the divergence in output actions between two agents when provided with the same observation. Subsequently, we introduce dynamic consistency intrinsic reward (DCIR) to stimulate agents to be aware of others' behaviors and determine whether to be consistent with them. Lastly, we devise a dynamic scale network (DSN) that provides learnable scale factors for the agent at every time step to dynamically ascertain whether to award consistent behavior and the magnitude of rewards. We evaluate DCIR in multiple environments including Multi-agent Particle, Google Research Football and StarCraft II Micromanagement, demonstrating its efficacy.			arxiv	['Yufeng Wang', 'Peihao Chen', 'Runhao Zeng', 'Siyuan Zhou', 'Mingkui Tan', 'Chuang Gan']	376.0

Ismail	2023-12-20 01:47:55	http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12700v1	In this note, I introduce Estimated Performance Rating (PR$^e$), a novel system for evaluating player performance in sports and games. PR$^e$ addresses a key limitation of the Tournament Performance Rating (TPR) system, which is undefined for zero or perfect scores in a series of games. PR$^e$ is defined as the rating that solves an optimization problem related to scoring probability, making it applicable for any performance level. The main theorem establishes that the PR$^e$ of a player is equivalent to the TPR whenever the latter is defined. I then apply this system to historically significant win-streaks in association football, tennis, and chess. Beyond sports, PR$^e$ has broad applicability in domains where Elo ratings are used, from college rankings to the evaluation of large language models.			arxiv	[]	377.0

Modeled on the dynamics of biological swarms, CSI enables the reasoning benefits of small-groups with the collective intelligence benefits of large-groups. In this pilot study, groups of 25 to 30 participants were asked to select players for a weekly Fantasy Football contest over an 11-week period. As a baseline, participants filled out a survey to record their player selections. As an experimental method, participants engaged in a real-time text-chat deliberation using a CSI platform called Thinkscape to collaboratively select sets of players. The results show that the real-time conversational group using CSI outperformed 66% of survey participants, demonstrating significant amplification of intelligence versus the median individual (p=0.020). The CSI method also significantly outperformed the most popular choices from the survey (the Wisdom of Crowd, p<0.001). These results suggest that CSI is an effective technology for amplifying the intelligence of groups engaged in real-time large-scale conversational deliberation and may offer a path to collective superintelligence.			arxiv	['Gregg Willcox', 'Hans Schumann', 'Ganesh Mani']	378.0

Along with this technological evolution has come a higher standard to ensure a good viewing experience for the casual sports fan. It can be argued that the pervasion of statistical analysis in sports serves to satiate the fan's desire for detailed sports statistics. The goal of statistical analysis in sports is a simple one: to eliminate subjective analysis. In this paper, we review previous work that attempts to analyze various aspects in sports by using ideas from Markov Chains, Bayesian Inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The unifying goal of these works is to achieve an accurate representation of the player's ability, the sport, or the environmental effects on the player's performance. With the prevalence of cheap computation, it is possible that using techniques in Artificial Intelligence could improve the result of statistical analysis in sport. This is best illustrated when evaluating football using Neuro Dynamic Programming, a Control Theory paradigm heavily based on theory in Stochastic processes. The results from this method suggest that statistical analysis in sports may benefit from using ideas from the area of Control Theory or Machine Learning			arxiv	[]	379.0
912	Ordered community structure in networks	Steve Gregory	2011-04-05 19:55:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0923v3	Community structure in networks is often a consequence of homophily, or assortative mixing, based on some attribute of the vertices. For example, researchers may be grouped into communities corresponding to their research topic. This is possible if vertex attributes have discrete values, but many networks exhibit assortative mixing by some continuous-valued attribute, such as age or geographical location. In such cases, no discrete communities can be identified. We consider how the notion of community structure can be generalized to networks that are based on continuous-valued attributes: in general, a network may contain discrete communities which are ordered according to their attribute values. We propose a method of generating synthetic ordered networks and investigate the effect of ordered community structure on the spread of infectious diseases. We also show that community detection algorithms fail to recover community structure in ordered networks, and evaluate an alternative method using a layout algorithm to recover the ordering.			arxiv	[]	380.0
913	Assessing the consistency of community structure in complex networks	Matthew Steen	2011-05-31 22:16:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0041v3	In recent years, community structure has emerged as a key component of complex network analysis. As more data has been collected, researchers have begun investigating changing community structure across multiple networks. Several methods exist to analyze changing communities, but most of these are limited to evolution of a single network over time. In addition, most of the existing methods are more concerned with change at the community level than at the level of the individual node. In this paper, we introduce scaled inclusivity, which is a method to quantify the change in community structure across networks. Scaled inclusivity evaluates the consistency of the classiffication of every node in a network independently. In addition, the method can be applied cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally. In this paper, we calculate the scaled inclusivity for a set of simulated networks of United States cities and a set of real networks consisting of teams that play in the top division of American college football. We found that scaled inclusivity yields reasonable results for the consistency of individual nodes in both sets of networks. We propose that scaled inclusivity may provide a useful way to quantify the change in a network's community structure.			arxiv	['Satoru Hayasaka', 'Karen Joyce', 'Paul Laurienti']	381.0
914	Scoring Strategies for the Underdog: A general, quantitative method for determining optimal sports strategies	Brian Skinner	2011-11-02 23:54:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0693v1	When facing a heavily-favored opponent, an underdog must be willing to assume greater-than-average risk. In statistical language, one would say that an underdog must be willing to adopt a strategy whose outcome has a larger-than-average variance. The difficult question is how much risk a team should be willing to accept. This is equivalent to asking how much the team should be willing to sacrifice from its mean score in order to increase the score's variance. In this paper a general, analytical method is developed for addressing this question quantitatively. Under the assumption that every play in a game is statistically independent, both the mean and the variance of a team's offensive output can be described using the binomial distribution. This description allows for direct calculations of the winning probability when a particular strategy is employed, and therefore allows one to calculate optimal offensive strategies. This paper develops this method for calculating optimal strategies exactly and then presents a simple heuristic for determining whether a given strategy should be adopted. A number of interesting and counterintuitive examples are then explored, including the merits of stalling for time, the run/pass/Hail Mary choice in American football, and the correct use of Hack-a-Shaq.			arxiv	[]	382.0

Buchner	2013-02-06 15:53:56	http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1523v1	Performance prediction or forecasting sporting outcomes involves a great deal of insight into the particular area one is dealing with, and a considerable amount of intuition about the factors that bear on such outcomes and performances. The mathematical Theory of Evidence offers representation formalisms which grant experts a high degree of freedom when expressing their subjective beliefs in the context of decision-making situations like performance prediction. Furthermore, this reasoning framework incorporates a powerful mechanism to systematically pool the decisions made by individual subject matter experts. The idea behind such a combination of knowledge is to improve the competence (quality) of the overall decision-making process. This paper reports on a performance prediction experiment carried out during the European Football Championship in 1996. Relying on the knowledge of four predictors, Evidence Theory was used to forecast the final scores of all 31 matches. The results of this empirical study are very encouraging.			arxiv	"['Werner Dubitzky', 'Alfons Schuster', 'Philippe Lopes', ""Peter G. O'Donoghue"", 'John G. Hughes', 'David A.

For the Scottish Football Association (SFA), the allocation of referees and other officials to matches is governed by a number of rules specifying the expertise required from the different types of official at each level, e.g. Scottish Premiership League referee must be a grade 1 with high experience. The allocation requires an SFA secretary to expend several hours to find suitable officials, contact them and assign them. Most of the time, the secretary is a volunteer who performs the allocation as a hobby and it would be useful to reduce his costs and time. The project aims to reduce the burden on SFA, and potentially other secretaries, by developing a program to assign SFA officials. A suitable algorithm must be devised to search through the set of data about matches and officials and find a potential allocation. The program then updates the database with the new data, and provides a web interface for both secretaries and officials. A prototype system using the new greedy algorithm has been implemented and evaluated with SFA secretaries. A final usable referee allocation system has been designed that uses the greedy algorithm, and is extended after evaluation of the prototype. The final allocation system based provides both a command line and a web interface and has also been evaluated by SFA secretaries. In their letters of recommendation in Appendix F the SFA secretaries indicate that the final allocation system it will be used again in the future.			arxiv	[]	384.0

We introduce a generalization of the BTER model of Seshadhri et al. by adding flexibility to community structure, and use this model to perform multi-scale graph anomaly detection. Specifically, probability models describing coarse subgraphs are built by aggregating probabilities at finer levels, and these closely related hierarchical models simultaneously detect deviations from expectation. This technique provides insight into a graph's structure and internal context that may shed light on a detected event. Additionally, this multi-scale analysis facilitates intuitive visualizations by allowing users to narrow focus from an anomalous graph to particular subgraphs or nodes causing the anomaly. For evaluation, two hierarchical anomaly detectors are tested against a baseline Gaussian method on a series of sampled graphs. We demonstrate that our graph statistics-based approach outperforms both a distribution-based detector and the baseline in a labeled setting with community structure, and it accurately detects anomalies in synthetic and real-world datasets at the node, subgraph, and graph levels. To illustrate the accessibility of information made possible via this technique, the anomaly detector and an associated interactive visualization tool are tested on NCAA football data, where teams and conferences that moved within the league are identified with perfect recall, and precision greater than 0.786.			arxiv	['John Collins', 'Erik M.

918	This House Proves that Debating is Harder than Soccer	Stefan Neumann	2016-05-10 15:34:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03063v1	During the last twenty years, a lot of research was conducted on the sport elimination problem: Given a sports league and its remaining matches, we have to decide whether a given team can still possibly win the competition, i.e., place first in the league at the end. Previously, the computational complexity of this problem was investigated only for games with two participating teams per game. In this paper we consider Debating Tournaments and Debating Leagues in the British Parliamentary format, where four teams are participating in each game. We prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether a given team can win a Debating League, even if at most two matches are remaining for each team. This contrasts settings like football where two teams play in each game since there this case is still polynomial time solvable. We prove our result even for a fictitious restricted setting with only three teams per game. On the other hand, for the common setting of Debating Tournaments we show that this problem is fixed parameter tractable if the parameter is the number of remaining rounds $k$. This also holds for the practically very important question of whether a team can still qualify for the knock-out phase of the tournament and the combined parameter $k + b$ where $b$ denotes the threshold rank for qualifying. Finally, we show that the latter problem is polynomial time solvable for any constant $k$ and arbitrary values $b$ that are part of the input.			arxiv	['Andreas Wiese']	386.0
919	Top dense hyperbolic ball packings and coverings for complete Coxeter orthoscheme groups	Emil Molnár	2016-12-14 09:06:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04541v1	"In $n$-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbf{H}^n$ $(n\ge2)$ there are $3$-types of spheres (balls): the sphere, horosphere and hypersphere. If $n=2,3$ we know an universal upper bound of the ball packing densities, where each ball volume is related to the volume of the corresponding Dirichlet-Voronoi (D-V) cell. E.g. in $\mathbf{H}^3$ the densest horoball packing is derived from the $\{3,3,6\}$ Coxeter tiling consisting of ideal regular simplices $T_{reg}^\infty$ with dihedral angles $\frac{\pi}{3}$. The density of this packing is $\delta_3^\infty\approx 0.85328$ and this provides a very rough upper bound for the ball packing densities as well. However, there are no ""essential"" results regarding the ""classical"" ball packings with congruent balls, and for ball coverings either. The goal of this paper to find the extremal ball arrangements in $\mathbf{H}^3$ with ""classical balls"". We consider only periodic congruent ball arrangements (for simplicity) related to the generalized, so-called {\it complete Coxeter orthoschemes} and their extended groups. In Theorems 1.1-1.2 we formulate also conjectures for the densest ball packing with density $0.77147\dots$ and the loosest ball covering with density $1.36893\dots$, respectively. Both are related with the extended Coxeter group $(5, 3, 5)$ and the so-called hyperbolic football manifold (look at Fig.~3). These facts can have important relations with fullerens in crystallography."			arxiv	['Jenő Szirmai']	387.0
920	Concussion classification via deep learning using whole-brain white matter fiber strains	Yunliang Cai	2017-05-12 14:40:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04600v2	Developing an accurate and reliable injury predictor is central to the biomechanical studies of traumatic brain injury. State-of-the-art efforts continue to rely on empirical, scalar metrics based on kinematics or model-estimated tissue responses explicitly pre-defined in a specific brain region of interest. They could suffer from loss of information. A single training dataset has also been used to evaluate performance but without cross-validation. In this study, we developed a deep learning approach for concussion classification using implicit features of the entire voxel-wise white matter fiber strains. Using reconstructed American National Football League (NFL) injury cases, leave-one-out cross-validation was employed to objectively compare injury prediction performances against two baseline machine learning classifiers (support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)) and four scalar metrics via univariate logistic regression (Brain Injury Criterion (BrIC), cumulative strain damage measure of the whole brain (CSDM-WB) and the corpus callosum (CSDM-CC), and peak fiber strain in the CC). Feature-based deep learning and machine learning classifiers consistently outperformed all scalar injury metrics across all performance categories in cross-validation (e.g., average accuracy of 0.844 vs. 0.746, and average area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.873 vs. 0.769, respectively, based on the testing dataset). Nevertheless, deep learning achieved the best cross-validation accuracy, sensitivity, and AUC (e.g., accuracy of 0.862 vs. 0.828 and 0.842 for SVM and RF, respectively). These findings demonstrate the superior performances of deep learning in concussion prediction, and suggest its promise for future applications in biomechanical investigations of traumatic brain injury.			arxiv	['Shaoju Wu', 'Wei Zhao', 'Zhigang Li', 'Songbai Ji']	388.0
921	How a General-Purpose Commonsense Ontology can Improve Performance of Learning-Based Image Retrieval	Rodrigo Toro Icarte	2017-05-24 16:22:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08844v1	"The knowledge representation community has built general-purpose ontologies which contain large amounts of commonsense knowledge over relevant aspects of the world, including useful visual information, e.g.: ""a ball is used by a football player"", ""a tennis player is located at a tennis court"". Current state-of-the-art approaches for visual recognition do not exploit these rule-based knowledge sources. Instead, they learn recognition models directly from training examples. In this paper, we study how general-purpose ontologies---specifically, MIT's ConceptNet ontology---can improve the performance of state-of-the-art vision systems. As a testbed, we tackle the problem of sentence-based image retrieval. Our retrieval approach incorporates knowledge from ConceptNet on top of a large pool of object detectors derived from a deep learning technique. In our experiments, we show that ConceptNet can improve performance on a common benchmark dataset. Key to our performance is the use of the ESPGAME dataset to select visually relevant relations from ConceptNet. Consequently, a main conclusion of this work is that general-purpose commonsense ontologies improve performance on visual reasoning tasks when properly filtered to select meaningful visual relations."			arxiv	['Jorge A.

922	Community Detection by $L_0$-penalized Graph Laplacian	Chong Chen	2017-06-30 17:01:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10273v1	Community detection in network analysis aims at partitioning nodes in a network into $K$ disjoint communities. Most currently available algorithms assume that $K$ is known, but choosing a correct $K$ is generally very difficult for real networks. In addition, many real networks contain outlier nodes not belonging to any community, but currently very few algorithm can handle networks with outliers. In this paper, we propose a novel model free tightness criterion and an efficient algorithm to maximize this criterion for community detection. This tightness criterion is closely related with the graph Laplacian with $L_0$ penalty. Unlike most community detection methods, our method does not require a known $K$ and can properly detect communities in networks with outliers. Both theoretical and numerical properties of the method are analyzed. The theoretical result guarantees that, under the degree corrected stochastic block model, even for networks with outliers, the maximizer of the tightness criterion can extract communities with small misclassification rates even when the number of communities grows to infinity as the network size grows. Simulation study shows that the proposed method can recover true communities more accurately than other methods. Applications to a college football data and a yeast protein-protein interaction data also reveal that the proposed method performs significantly better.			arxiv	['Ruibin Xi', 'Nan Lin']	390.0
923	UEFA against the champions? An evaluation of the recent reform of the Champions League qualification	László Csató	2019-12-04 16:07:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02076v7	The UEFA Champions League is the major European club football competition, however, most national champions have to play qualification matches to receive a slot in the group stage of the tournament. The paper evaluates the impact of the only reform in the Champions Path of the qualifying system since 2009, effective from the 2018/19 season. While it is anticipated that the reduction in the number of berths decreases the probability of advancing to the group stage, the distribution of the effects among the national associations is revealed here via Monte-Carlo simulations. In contrast to previous studies, our methodology considers five seasons instead of only one to filter out any possible season-specific attributes. Almost all countries are found to gain less prize money on average. Several champions, including the Bulgarian, the Scottish, and, especially, the Swiss, might lose million Euros. As the consequences depend to a large extent on the arbitrary cutoffs in the access list, we propose to introduce some randomness into the determination of entry stages in the qualification.			arxiv	[]	391.0
924	Brain perfusion mediates the relationship between miRNA levels and postural control	Yufen Chen	2019-12-05 22:16:54	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02901v1	"Transcriptomics, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and a spatial motor virtual reality task were integrated using mediation analysis in a novel demonstration of ""imaging omics"". Data collected in NCAA Division I football athletes cleared for play before in-season training showed significant relationships in a) elevated levels of miR-30d and miR-92a to elevated putamen rCBF, (b) elevated putamen rCBF to compromised balance scores, and (c) compromised balance scores to elevated miRNA levels. rCBF acted as a mediator variable (minimum 70% mediation, significant Sobel's test) between abnormal miRNA levels and compromised balance scores. Given the involvement of these miRNAs in inflammation and immune function, and that vascular perfusion is a component of the inflammatory response, these findings support a chronic inflammatory model of repetitive head acceleration events (HAEs). rCBF, a systems biology measure, was necessary for miRNA to affect behavior. These results suggest miRNA as a potential diagnostic biomarker for repetitive HAEs."			arxiv	['Amy A Herrold', 'Zoran Martinovich', 'Anne J Blood', 'Nicole Vike', 'Alexa E Walter', 'Jaroslaw Harezlak', 'Peter H Seidenberg', 'Manish Bhomia', 'Barbara Knollmann-Ritschel', 'James L Reilly', 'Eric A Nauman', 'Thomas M Talavage', 'Linda Papa', 'Semyon Slobounov', 'Hans C Breiter']	392.0
925	Learning Cross-Context Entity Representations from Text	Jeffrey Ling	2020-01-11 15:30:56	http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03765v1	Language modeling tasks, in which words, or word-pieces, are predicted on the basis of a local context, have been very effective for learning word embeddings and context dependent representations of phrases. Motivated by the observation that efforts to code world knowledge into machine readable knowledge bases or human readable encyclopedias tend to be entity-centric, we investigate the use of a fill-in-the-blank task to learn context independent representations of entities from the text contexts in which those entities were mentioned. We show that large scale training of neural models allows us to learn high quality entity representations, and we demonstrate successful results on four domains: (1) existing entity-level typing benchmarks, including a 64% error reduction over previous work on TypeNet (Murty et al., 2018); (2) a novel few-shot category reconstruction task; (3) existing entity linking benchmarks, where we match the state-of-the-art on CoNLL-Aida without linking-specific features and obtain a score of 89.8% on TAC-KBP 2010 without using any alias table, external knowledge base or in domain training data and (4) answering trivia questions, which uniquely identify entities. Our global entity representations encode fine-grained type categories, such as Scottish footballers, and can answer trivia questions such as: Who was the last inmate of Spandau jail in Berlin?			arxiv	['Nicholas FitzGerald', 'Zifei Shan', 'Livio Baldini Soares', 'Thibault Févry', 'David Weiss', 'Tom Kwiatkowski']	393.0
926	Optimal Data Collection For Informative Rankings Expose Well-Connected Graphs	Braxton Osting	2012-07-26 23:14:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.6430v2	Given a graph where vertices represent alternatives and arcs represent pairwise comparison data, the statistical ranking problem is to find a potential function, defined on the vertices, such that the gradient of the potential function agrees with the pairwise comparisons. Our goal in this paper is to develop a method for collecting data for which the least squares estimator for the ranking problem has maximal Fisher information. Our approach, based on experimental design, is to view data collection as a bi-level optimization problem where the inner problem is the ranking problem and the outer problem is to identify data which maximizes the informativeness of the ranking. Under certain assumptions, the data collection problem decouples, reducing to a problem of finding multigraphs with large algebraic connectivity. This reduction of the data collection problem to graph-theoretic questions is one of the primary contributions of this work. As an application, we study the Yahoo! Movie user rating dataset and demonstrate that the addition of a small number of well-chosen pairwise comparisons can significantly increase the Fisher informativeness of the ranking. As another application, we study the 2011-12 NCAA football schedule and propose schedules with the same number of games which are significantly more informative. Using spectral clustering methods to identify highly-connected communities within the division, we argue that the NCAA could improve its notoriously poor rankings by simply scheduling more out-of-conference games.			arxiv	['Christoph Brune', 'Stanley J.

927	TwitterPaul: Extracting and Aggregating Twitter Predictions	Naushad UzZaman	2012-11-28 01:33:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.6496v2	This paper introduces TwitterPaul, a system designed to make use of Social Media data to help to predict game outcomes for the 2010 FIFA World Cup tournament. To this end, we extracted over 538K mentions to football games from a large sample of tweets that occurred during the World Cup, and we classified into different types with a precision of up to 88%. The different mentions were aggregated in order to make predictions about the outcomes of the actual games. We attempt to learn which Twitter users are accurate predictors and explore several techniques in order to exploit this information to make more accurate predictions. We compare our results to strong baselines and against the betting line (prediction market) and found that the quality of extractions is more important than the quantity, suggesting that high precision methods working on a medium-sized dataset are preferable over low precision methods that use a larger amount of data. Finally, by aggregating some classes of predictions, the system performance is close to the one of the betting line. Furthermore, we believe that this domain independent framework can help to predict other sports, elections, product release dates and other future events that people talk about in social media.			arxiv	['Roi Blanco', 'Michael Matthews']	395.0
928	When neither team wants to win: a flaw of recent UEFA qualification rules	László Csató	2018-06-22 09:57:19	http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08578v8	Tanking, the act of deliberately dropping points or losing a game in order to gain some other advantage, is usually seen as being against the spirit of sports. It can be even more serious if playing a draw is a (weakly) dominant strategy for both teams in a match, since this may lead to collusion. We show that such a situation occurred in a particular football match. As our generalisation reveals, the root of the problem resides in the incentive incompatibility of certain UEFA qualification rules. The governing bodies of major sports should choose strategy-proof tournament designs because of several reasons. First, they may lead to the elimination of a third, innocent team. Second, incentive incompatible rules may discourage both teams from scoring goals, and the players could be interested in improving other match statistics than the number of goals.			arxiv	[]	396.0
929	Monte Carlo Neural Fictitious Self-Play: Approach to Approximate Nash equilibrium of Imperfect-Information Games	Li Zhang	2019-03-22 15:58:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09569v2	Researchers on artificial intelligence have achieved human-level intelligence in large-scale perfect-information games, but it is still a challenge to achieve (nearly) optimal results (in other words, an approximate Nash Equilibrium) in large-scale imperfect-information games (i.e. war games, football coach or business strategies). Neural Fictitious Self Play (NFSP) is an effective algorithm for learning approximate Nash equilibrium of imperfect-information games from self-play without prior domain knowledge. However, it relies on Deep Q-Network, which is off-line and is hard to converge in online games with changing opponent strategy, so it can't approach approximate Nash equilibrium in games with large search scale and deep search depth. In this paper, we propose Monte Carlo Neural Fictitious Self Play (MC-NFSP), an algorithm combines Monte Carlo tree search with NFSP, which greatly improves the performance on large-scale zero-sum imperfect-information games. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed Monte Carlo Neural Fictitious Self Play can converge to approximate Nash equilibrium in games with large-scale search depth while the Neural Fictitious Self Play can't. Furthermore, we develop Asynchronous Neural Fictitious Self Play (ANFSP). It use asynchronous and parallel architecture to collect game experience. In experiments, we show that parallel actor-learners have a further accelerated and stabilizing effect on training.			arxiv	['Wei Wang', 'Shijian Li', 'Gang Pan']	397.0
930	Fair tournament design: A flaw of the UEFA Euro 2020 qualification	László Csató	2019-05-08 20:43:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03325v6	The integrity of a sport can be seriously undermined if its rules punish winning as this creates incentives for strategic manipulation. Therefore, a sports tournament can be called unfair if the overall win probabilities are not ordered according to the teams' ranking based on their past performances. We present how statistical methods can contribute to choosing a tournament format that is in line with the above axiom. In particular, the qualification for the 2020 UEFA European Championship is shown to violate this requirement: being a top team in the lowest-ranked League D of the 2018/19 UEFA Nations League substantially increases the probability of qualifying compared to being a bottom team in the higher-ranked League C. The unfairness can be remarkably reduced or even eliminated with slightly changing the path formation policy of the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying play-offs. The misaligned design has severely punished a team for winning a match years before. Since the deficiency is an inherent feature of the qualifying process, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) should reconsider the format of future tournaments to eliminate the unfair advantage enjoyed by certain teams.			arxiv	[]	398.0
931	A Bayesian Approach to In-Game Win Probability in Soccer	Pieter Robberechts	2019-06-12 09:38:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05029v2	In-game win probability models, which provide a sports team's likelihood of winning at each point in a game based on historical observations, are becoming increasingly popular. In baseball, basketball and American football, they have become important tools to enhance fan experience, to evaluate in-game decision-making, and to inform coaching decisions. While equally relevant in soccer, the adoption of these models is held back by technical challenges arising from the low-scoring nature of the sport. In this paper, we introduce an in-game win probability model for soccer that addresses the shortcomings of existing models. First, we demonstrate that in-game win probability models for other sports struggle to provide accurate estimates for soccer, especially towards the end of a game. Second, we introduce a novel Bayesian statistical framework that estimates running win, tie and loss probabilities by leveraging a set of contextual game state features. An empirical evaluation on eight seasons of data for the top-five soccer leagues demonstrates that our framework provides well-calibrated probabilities. Furthermore, two use cases show its ability to enhance fan experience and to evaluate performance in crucial game situations.			arxiv	['Jan Van Haaren', 'Jesse Davis']	399.0
932	Promoting Coordination through Policy Regularization in Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning	Julien Roy	2019-08-06 17:48:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02269v4	In multi-agent reinforcement learning, discovering successful collective behaviors is challenging as it requires exploring a joint action space that grows exponentially with the number of agents. While the tractability of independent agent-wise exploration is appealing, this approach fails on tasks that require elaborate group strategies. We argue that coordinating the agents' policies can guide their exploration and we investigate techniques to promote such an inductive bias. We propose two policy regularization methods: TeamReg, which is based on inter-agent action predictability and CoachReg that relies on synchronized behavior selection. We evaluate each approach on four challenging continuous control tasks with sparse rewards that require varying levels of coordination as well as on the discrete action Google Research Football environment. Our experiments show improved performance across many cooperative multi-agent problems. Finally, we analyze the effects of our proposed methods on the policies that our agents learn and show that our methods successfully enforce the qualities that we propose as proxies for coordinated behaviors.			arxiv	['Paul Barde', 'Félix G.

It is evident that a method capable of forecasting and analyzing the future of these players on-field antics shall assist the management to a great extent. In a simulated environment like the Fantasy Premier League, enthusiasts from all over the world participate and manage the players catalogue for the entire season. Due to the dynamic nature of points system, there is no known approach for the formulation of a dream team. This study aims to tackle this problem by using a hybrid of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for time series prediction of player points and subsequent maximization of total points using Linear Programming (LPP). Given the player points for the past three seasons, the predictions have been made for the current season by modeling differently for ARIMA and RNN, and then creating an ensemble of the same. Prior to that, proper data preprocessing techniques were deployed to enhance the efficacy of the prepared model. Constraints on the type of players like goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders and forwards along with the total budget were effectively optimized using LPP approach. The validation of the proposed team was done with the performance in upcoming season, where the players outperform as expected, and helped in strengthening the feasibility of the solution. Likewise, the proposed approach can be extended to English Premier League by official managers on-field.			arxiv	[]	401.0

Due to the peculiarity of the outcome variable (set-difference) which takes discrete values from $-3$ to $3$, we cannot consider standard models based on the usual Poisson or binomial assumptions used for other sports such as football/soccer. Hence, the first and foremost challenge was to build models appropriate for the set-differences of each volleyball match. Here we consider two major approaches: a) an ordered multinomial logistic regression model and b) a model based on a truncated version of the Skellam distribution. For the first model, we consider the set-difference as an ordinal response variable within the framework of multinomial logistic regression models. Concerning the second model, we adjust the Skellam distribution in order to account for the volleyball rules. We fit and compare both models with the same covariate structure as in Karlis & Ntzoufras (2003). Both models are fitted, illustrated and compared within Bayesian framework using data from both the regular season and the play-offs of the season 2016/17 of the Greek national men's volleyball league A1.			arxiv	['Vasilis Palaskas', 'Sotiris Drikos']	402.0
935	The Surprising Effectiveness of PPO in Cooperative, Multi-Agent Games	Chao Yu	2021-03-02 18:59:56	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01955v4	Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a ubiquitous on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm but is significantly less utilized than off-policy learning algorithms in multi-agent settings. This is often due to the belief that PPO is significantly less sample efficient than off-policy methods in multi-agent systems. In this work, we carefully study the performance of PPO in cooperative multi-agent settings. We show that PPO-based multi-agent algorithms achieve surprisingly strong performance in four popular multi-agent testbeds: the particle-world environments, the StarCraft multi-agent challenge, Google Research Football, and the Hanabi challenge, with minimal hyperparameter tuning and without any domain-specific algorithmic modifications or architectures. Importantly, compared to competitive off-policy methods, PPO often achieves competitive or superior results in both final returns and sample efficiency. Finally, through ablation studies, we analyze implementation and hyperparameter factors that are critical to PPO's empirical performance, and give concrete practical suggestions regarding these factors. Our results show that when using these practices, simple PPO-based methods can be a strong baseline in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning.

936	How often does the best team win? A unified approach to understanding randomness in North American sport	Michael J. Lopez	2017-01-21 03:28:57	http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05976v3	Statistical applications in sports have long centered on how to best separate signal (e.g. team talent) from random noise. However, most of this work has concentrated on a single sport, and the development of meaningful cross-sport comparisons has been impeded by the difficulty of translating luck from one sport to another. In this manuscript, we develop Bayesian state-space models using betting market data that can be uniformly applied across sporting organizations to better understand the role of randomness in game outcomes. These models can be used to extract estimates of team strength, the between-season, within-season, and game-to-game variability of team strengths, as well each team's home advantage. We implement our approach across a decade of play in each of the National Football League (NFL), National Hockey League (NHL), National Basketball Association (NBA), and Major League Baseball (MLB), finding that the NBA demonstrates both the largest dispersion in talent and the largest home advantage, while the NHL and MLB stand out for their relative randomness in game outcomes. We conclude by proposing new metrics for judging competitiveness across sports leagues, both within the regular season and using traditional postseason tournament formats. Although we focus on sports, we discuss a number of other situations in which our generalizable models might be usefully applied.			arxiv	['Gregory J. Matthews', 'Benjamin S. Baumer']	404.0

However, a lot of attention has been focused on each coach's individual features. A systematic and quantitative analysis of the whole coach hiring market is lacking. In a coach hiring network, the coaches are actually voting with their feet. It is interesting to analyze what factors are affecting the ""footprint"" left by those head coaches. In this paper, we collect more than 12,000 head coach hiring records in two different popular sports from the NCAA. Using network-based methods, we build the coach hiring network in the NCAA men's basketball and football. We find that: (1).the coach hiring network is of great inequality in coach production with a Gini coefficient close to 0.60. (2).coaches prefer to work within the same geographical region and the same division to their alma maters'. (3).the coach production rankings we calculated using network-based methods are generally correlated to the authoritative rankings, but also show disaccord in specific time period. The results provide us a novel view and better understanding of the coach hiring market in the NCAA and shed new light on the coach hiring system."			arxiv	['Jason', 'Zhang', 'Dongwon Lee']	405.0

Reagan	2017-12-17 19:33:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06163v1	Given the growing assortment of sentiment measuring instruments, it is imperative to understand which aspects of sentiment dictionaries contribute to both their classification accuracy and their ability to provide richer understanding of texts. Here, we perform detailed, quantitative tests and qualitative assessments of 6 dictionary-based methods applied, and briefly examine a further 20 methods. We show that while inappropriate for sentences, dictionary-based methods are generally robust in their classification accuracy for longer texts. Stories often following distinct emotional trajectories, forming patterns that are meaningful to us. By classifying the emotional arcs for a filtered subset of 4,803 stories from Project Gutenberg's fiction collection, we find a set of six core trajectories which form the building blocks of complex narratives. Of profound scientific interest will be the degree to which we can eventually understand the full landscape of human stories, and data driven approaches will play a crucial role. Finally, we utilize web-scale data from Twitter to study the limits of what social data can tell us about public health, mental illness, discourse around the protest movement of #BlackLivesMatter, discourse around climate change, and hidden networks. We conclude with a review of published works in complex systems that separately analyze charitable donations, the happiness of words in 10 languages, 100 years of daily temperature data across the United States, and Australian Rules Football games.			arxiv	[]	406.0
939	Cosmic footballs from superrotations	Eugene Adjei	2019-10-11 23:13:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05435v1	Superrotations arise from singular vector fields on the celestial sphere in asymptotically flat space, and their finite integrated versions have been argued by Strominger and Zhiboedov to insert cosmic strings into the spacetime. In this work, we argue for an alternative definition of the action of superrotations on Minkowski space that avoids introducing any defects. This involves realizing the finite superrotation not as a diffeomorphism between spaces, but as a mapping of Minkowski space to itself that may be multivalued or non-surjective. This eliminates any defects in the bulk spacetime at the expense of allowing for defects in the boundary celestial sphere metric. We further explore the geometry of the spatial surfaces in the superrotated spaces, and note that they intersect null infinity at the singularity of the superrotation, causing a breakdown in the large $r$ asymptotic expansion there. To determine how these surfaces embed into Minkowski space, a derivation of the finite superrotation transformation is presented in both Bondi and Newman-Unti gauges. The latter is particularly interesting, since the superrotations are shown to preserve the hyperbolic slicing of Minkowski space in Newman-Unti gauge, and this gauge also provides a means for extending the geometry beyond the Bondi coordinate patch. We argue that the new interpretation for the action of superrotations on spacetime motivates consideration of a wider class of celestial sphere metrics and asymptotic symmetry groups.			arxiv	['William Donnelly', 'Victor Py', 'Antony J.

940	Expected Hypothetical Completion Probability	Sameer K. Deshpande	2019-10-27 20:07:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12337v1	"Using high-resolution player tracking data made available by the National Football League (NFL) for their 2019 Big Data Bowl competition, we introduce the Expected Hypothetical Completion Probability (EHCP), a objective framework for evaluating plays. At the heart of EHCP is the question ""on a given passing play, did the quarterback throw the pass to the receiver who was most likely to catch it?"" To answer this question, we first built a Bayesian non-parametric catch probability model that automatically accounts for complex interactions between inputs like the receiver's speed and distances to the ball and nearest defender. While building such a model is, in principle, straightforward, using it to reason about a hypothetical pass is challenging because many of the model inputs corresponding to a hypothetical are necessarily unobserved. To wit, it is impossible to observe how close an un-targeted receiver would be to his nearest defender had the pass been thrown to him instead of the receiver who was actually targeted. To overcome this fundamental difficulty, we propose imputing the unobservable inputs and averaging our model predictions across these imputations to derive EHCP. In this way, EHCP can track how the completion probability evolves for each receiver over the course of a play in a way that accounts for the uncertainty about missing inputs."			arxiv	['Katherine Evans']	408.0

Albert	2019-10-16 18:19:45	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13347v1	Quarterback performance can be difficult to rank, and much effort has been spent in creating new rating systems. However, the input statistics for such ratings are subject to randomness and factors outside the quarterback's control. To investigate this variance, we perform a sensitivity analysis of three quarterback rating statistics: the Traditional 1971 rating by Smith, the Burke, and the Wages of Wins ratings. The comparisons are made at the team level for the 32 NFL teams from 2002-2015, thus giving each case an even 16 games. We compute quarterback ratings for each offense with 1-5 additional touchdowns, 1-5 fewer interceptions, 1-5 additional sacks, and a 1-5 percent increase in the passing completion rate. Our sensitivity analysis provides insight into whether an elite passing team could seem mediocre or vice versa based on random outcomes. The results indicate that the Traditional rating is the most sensitive statistic with respect to touchdowns, interceptions, and completions, whereas the Burke rating is most sensitive to sacks. The analysis suggests that team passing offense rankings are highly sensitive to aspects of football that are out of the quarterback's hands (e.g., deflected passes that lead to interceptions). Thus, on the margins, we show arguments about whether a specific quarterback has entered the elite or remains mediocre are irrelevant.			arxiv	['John N. Angelis']	409.0
942	Generalizing Cross-Document Event Coreference Resolution Across Multiple Corpora	Michael Bugert	2020-11-24 17:45:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12249v2	Cross-document event coreference resolution (CDCR) is an NLP task in which mentions of events need to be identified and clustered throughout a collection of documents. CDCR aims to benefit downstream multi-document applications, but despite recent progress on corpora and system development, downstream improvements from applying CDCR have not been shown yet. We make the observation that every CDCR system to date was developed, trained, and tested only on a single respective corpus. This raises strong concerns on their generalizability -- a must-have for downstream applications where the magnitude of domains or event mentions is likely to exceed those found in a curated corpus. To investigate this assumption, we define a uniform evaluation setup involving three CDCR corpora: ECB+, the Gun Violence Corpus and the Football Coreference Corpus (which we reannotate on token level to make our analysis possible). We compare a corpus-independent, feature-based system against a recent neural system developed for ECB+. Whilst being inferior in absolute numbers, the feature-based system shows more consistent performance across all corpora whereas the neural system is hit-and-miss. Via model introspection, we find that the importance of event actions, event time, etc. for resolving coreference in practice varies greatly between the corpora. Additional analysis shows that several systems overfit on the structure of the ECB+ corpus. We conclude with recommendations on how to achieve generally applicable CDCR systems in the future -- the most important being that evaluation on multiple CDCR corpora is strongly necessary. To facilitate future research, we release our dataset, annotation guidelines, and system implementation to the public.			arxiv	['Nils Reimers', 'Iryna Gurevych']	410.0
943	Data-driven Analysis for Understanding Team Sports Behaviors	Keisuke Fujii	2021-02-15 13:31:45	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07545v2	Understanding the principles of real-world biological multi-agent behaviors is a current challenge in various scientific and engineering fields. The rules regarding the real-world biological multi-agent behaviors such as team sports are often largely unknown due to their inherently higher-order interactions, cognition, and body dynamics. Estimation of the rules from data, i.e., data-driven approaches such as machine learning, provides an effective way for the analysis of such behaviors. Although most data-driven models have non-linear structures and high prediction performances, it is sometimes hard to interpret them. This survey focuses on data-driven analysis for quantitative understanding of invasion team sports behaviors such as basketball and football, and introduces two main approaches for understanding such multi-agent behaviors: (1) extracting easily interpretable features or rules from data and (2) generating and controlling behaviors in visually-understandable ways. The first approach involves the visualization of learned representations and the extraction of mathematical structures behind the behaviors. The second approach can be used to test hypotheses by simulating and controlling future and counterfactual behaviors. Lastly, the potential practical applications of extracted rules, features, and generated behaviors are discussed. These approaches can contribute to a better understanding of multi-agent behaviors in the real world.			arxiv	[]	411.0
944	The Soccer Game, bit by bit: An information-theoretic analysis	Luis Ramada Pereira	2021-02-22 17:00:54	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11182v4	We modeled the dynamics of a soccer match based on a network representation where players are nodes discretely clustered into homogeneous groups. Players were grouped by physical proximity, supported by the intuitive notion that competing and same-team players use relative position as a key tactical tool to contribute to the team's objectives. The model was applied to a set of matches from a major European national football league, with players' coordinates sampled at 10Hz, resulting in approx. 60,000 network samples per match. We took an information theoretic approach to measuring distance between samples and used it as a proxy for the game dynamics. Significant correlations were found between measurements and key match events that are empirically known to result in players jostling for position, such as when striving to get unmarked or to mark. These events increase the information distance, while breaks in game play have the opposite effect. By analyzing the frequency spectrum of players' cluster transitions and their corresponding information distance, it is possible to build a comprehensive view of player's interactions, useful for training and strategy development. This analysis can be drilled down to the level of individual players by quantifying their contribution to cluster breakup and emergence, building an overall multi-level map that provides insights into the game dynamics, from the individual player, to the clusters of interacting players, all the way to the teams and their matches.			arxiv	['Rui J.

945	Modeling Collective Anticipation and Response on Wikipedia	Ryota Kobayashi	2021-05-23 09:51:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10900v1	The dynamics of popularity in online media are driven by a combination of endogenous spreading mechanisms and response to exogenous shocks including news and events. However, little is known about the dependence of temporal patterns of popularity on event-related information, e.g. which types of events trigger long-lasting activity. Here we propose a simple model that describes the dynamics around peaks of popularity by incorporating key features, i.e., the anticipatory growth and the decay of collective attention together with circadian rhythms. The proposed model allows us to develop a new method for predicting the future page view activity and for clustering time series. To validate our methodology, we collect a corpus of page view data from Wikipedia associated to a range of planned events, that are events which we know in advance will have a fixed date in the future, such as elections and sport events. Our methodology is superior to existing models in both prediction and clustering tasks. Furthermore, restricting to Wikipedia pages associated to association football, we observe that the specific realization of the event, in our case which team wins a match or the type of the match, has a significant effect on the response dynamics after the event. Our work demonstrates the importance of appropriately modeling all phases of collective attention, as well as the connection between temporal patterns of attention and characteristic underlying information of the events they represent.			arxiv	['Patrick Gildersleve', 'Takeaki Uno', 'Renaud Lambiotte']	413.0
946	Scenic4RL: Programmatic Modeling and Generation of Reinforcement Learning Environments	Abdus Salam Azad	2021-06-18 21:49:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10365v2	The capability of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent heavily depends on the diversity of the learning scenarios generated by the environment. Generation of diverse realistic scenarios is challenging for real-time strategy (RTS) environments. The RTS environments are characterized by intelligent entities/non-RL agents cooperating and competing with the RL agents with large state and action spaces over a long period of time, resulting in an infinite space of feasible, but not necessarily realistic, scenarios involving complex interaction among different RL and non-RL agents. Yet, most of the existing simulators rely on randomly generating the environments based on predefined settings/layouts and offer limited flexibility and control over the environment dynamics for researchers to generate diverse, realistic scenarios as per their demand. To address this issue, for the first time, we formally introduce the benefits of adopting an existing formal scenario specification language, SCENIC, to assist researchers to model and generate diverse scenarios in an RTS environment in a flexible, systematic, and programmatic manner. To showcase the benefits, we interfaced SCENIC to an existing RTS environment Google Research Football(GRF) simulator and introduced a benchmark consisting of 32 realistic scenarios, encoded in SCENIC, to train RL agents and testing their generalization capabilities. We also show how researchers/RL practitioners can incorporate their domain knowledge to expedite the training process by intuitively modeling stochastic programmatic policies with SCENIC.			arxiv	['Edward Kim', 'Qiancheng Wu', 'Kimin Lee', 'Ion Stoica', 'Pieter Abbeel', 'Sanjit A.

947	Multivariate Conway-Maxwell-Poisson Distribution: Sarmanov Method and Doubly-Intractable Bayesian Inference	Luiza S. C. Piancastelli	2021-07-15 18:48:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07561v1	In this paper, a multivariate count distribution with Conway-Maxwell (COM)-Poisson marginals is proposed. To do this, we develop a modification of the Sarmanov method for constructing multivariate distributions. Our multivariate COM-Poisson (MultCOMP) model has desirable features such as (i) it admits a flexible covariance matrix allowing for both negative and positive non-diagonal entries; (ii) it overcomes the limitation of the existing bivariate COM-Poisson distributions in the literature that do not have COM-Poisson marginals; (iii) it allows for the analysis of multivariate counts and is not just limited to bivariate counts. Inferential challenges are presented by the likelihood specification as it depends on a number of intractable normalizing constants involving the model parameters. These obstacles motivate us to propose a Bayesian inferential approach where the resulting doubly-intractable posterior is dealt with via the exchange algorithm and the Grouped Independence Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Numerical experiments based on simulations are presented to illustrate the proposed Bayesian approach. We analyze the potential of the MultCOMP model through a real data application on the numbers of goals scored by the home and away teams in the Premier League from 2018 to 2021. Here, our interest is to assess the effect of a lack of crowds during the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-known home team advantage. A MultCOMP model fit shows that there is evidence of a decreased number of goals scored by the home team, not accompanied by a reduced score from the opponent. Hence, our analysis suggests a smaller home team advantage in the absence of crowds, which agrees with the opinion of several football experts.			arxiv	['Nial Friel', 'Wagner Barreto-Souza', 'Hernando Ombao']	415.0
948	Adaptive Multi-view and Temporal Fusing Transformer for 3D Human Pose Estimation	Hui Shuai	2021-10-11 08:57:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05092v2	This paper proposes a unified framework dubbed Multi-view and Temporal Fusing Transformer (MTF-Transformer) to adaptively handle varying view numbers and video length without camera calibration in 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE). It consists of Feature Extractor, Multi-view Fusing Transformer (MFT), and Temporal Fusing Transformer (TFT). Feature Extractor estimates 2D pose from each image and fuses the prediction according to the confidence. It provides pose-focused feature embedding and makes subsequent modules computationally lightweight. MFT fuses the features of a varying number of views with a novel Relative-Attention block. It adaptively measures the implicit relative relationship between each pair of views and reconstructs more informative features. TFT aggregates the features of the whole sequence and predicts 3D pose via a transformer. It adaptively deals with the video of arbitrary length and fully unitizes the temporal information. The migration of transformers enables our model to learn spatial geometry better and preserve robustness for varying application scenarios. We report quantitative and qualitative results on the Human3.6M, TotalCapture, and KTH Multiview Football II. Compared with state-of-the-art methods with camera parameters, MTF-Transformer obtains competitive results and generalizes well to dynamic capture with an arbitrary number of unseen views.			arxiv	['Lele Wu', 'Qingshan Liu']	416.0
949	Focus on what matters: Applying Discourse Coherence Theory to Cross Document Coreference	William Held	2021-10-11 15:41:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05362v1	Performing event and entity coreference resolution across documents vastly increases the number of candidate mentions, making it intractable to do the full $n^2$ pairwise comparisons. Existing approaches simplify by considering coreference only within document clusters, but this fails to handle inter-cluster coreference, common in many applications. As a result cross-document coreference algorithms are rarely applied to downstream tasks. We draw on an insight from discourse coherence theory: potential coreferences are constrained by the reader's discourse focus. We model the entities/events in a reader's focus as a neighborhood within a learned latent embedding space which minimizes the distance between mentions and the centroids of their gold coreference clusters. We then use these neighborhoods to sample only hard negatives to train a fine-grained classifier on mention pairs and their local discourse features. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for both events and entities on the ECB+, Gun Violence, Football Coreference, and Cross-Domain Cross-Document Coreference corpora. Furthermore, training on multiple corpora improves average performance across all datasets by 17.2 F1 points, leading to a robust coreference resolution model for use in downstream tasks where link distribution is unknown.			arxiv	['Dan Iter', 'Dan Jurafsky']	417.0
950	Optimizing the expected maximum of two linear functions defined on a multivariate Gaussian distribution	David Bergman	2021-12-13 20:39:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07002v1	We study stochastic optimization problems with objective function given by the expectation of the maximum of two linear functions defined on the component random variables of a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We consider random variables that are arbitrarily correlated, and we show that the problem is NP-hard even if the space of feasible solutions is unconstrained. We exploit a closed-form expression for the objective function from the literature to construct a cutting-plane algorithm that can be seen as an extension of the integer L-shaped method for a highly nonlinear function, which includes the evaluation of the c.d.f and p.d.f of a standard normal random variable with decision variables as part of the arguments. To exhibit the model's applicability, we consider two featured applications. The first is daily fantasy sports, where the algorithm identifies entries with positive returns during the 2018-2019 National Football League season. The second is a special case of makespan minimization for two parallel machines and jobs with uncertain processing times; for the special case where the jobs are uncorrelated, we prove the equivalence between its deterministic and stochastic versions and show that our algorithm can deliver a constant-factor approximation guarantee for the problem. The results of our computational evaluation involving synthetic and real-world data suggest that our discretization and upper bounding techniques lead to significant computational improvements and that the proposed algorithm outperforms sub-optimal solutions approaches.			arxiv	['Carlos Cardonha', 'Jason Imbrogno', 'Leonardo Lozano']	418.0
951	Quantum Model Learning Agent: characterisation of quantum systems through machine learning	Brian Flynn	2021-12-15 19:01:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08409v1	Accurate models of real quantum systems are important for investigating their behaviour, yet are difficult to distill empirically. Here, we report an algorithm -- the Quantum Model Learning Agent (QMLA) -- to reverse engineer Hamiltonian descriptions of a target system. We test the performance of QMLA on a number of simulated experiments, demonstrating several mechanisms for the design of candidate Hamiltonian models and simultaneously entertaining numerous hypotheses about the nature of the physical interactions governing the system under study. QMLA is shown to identify the true model in the majority of instances, when provided with limited a priori information, and control of the experimental setup. Our protocol can explore Ising, Heisenberg and Hubbard families of models in parallel, reliably identifying the family which best describes the system dynamics. We demonstrate QMLA operating on large model spaces by incorporating a genetic algorithm to formulate new hypothetical models. The selection of models whose features propagate to the next generation is based upon an objective function inspired by the Elo rating scheme, typically used to rate competitors in games such as chess and football. In all instances, our protocol finds models that exhibit $F_1$-score $\geq 0.88$ when compared with the true model, and it precisely identifies the true model in 72% of cases, whilst exploring a space of over $250,000$ potential models. By testing which interactions actually occur in the target system, QMLA is a viable tool for both the exploration of fundamental physics and the characterisation and calibration of quantum devices.			arxiv	['Antonio Andreas Gentile', 'Nathan Wiebe', 'Raffaele Santagati', 'Anthony Laing']	419.0

From plastic sheets they cut twelve pentagons and twenty hexagons, with a calculated edge, sewing them together on a polystyrene sphere as faces of a soccer ball; they repeated the same operation twice, making two almost identical soccer-like balls. That multidisciplinary experience started on March 2013 and ended on June 2013. It was satisfactorily discussed in the 2013 school-leaving examination and raised a great interest both in the 100th national conference of the Italian Physical Society (Pisa, 2014) and in the ATINER's 9th annual international conference EMS (Athens, 2015).

953	Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality in Multiagent State Space: A Unified Agent Permutation Framework	Xiaotian Hao	2022-03-10 11:00:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05285v2	The state space in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) grows exponentially with the agent number. Such a curse of dimensionality results in poor scalability and low sample efficiency, inhibiting MARL for decades. To break this curse, we propose a unified agent permutation framework that exploits the permutation invariance (PI) and permutation equivariance (PE) inductive biases to reduce the multiagent state space. Our insight is that permuting the order of entities in the factored multiagent state space does not change the information. Specifically, we propose two novel implementations: a Dynamic Permutation Network (DPN) and a Hyper Policy Network (HPN). The core idea is to build separate entity-wise PI input and PE output network modules to connect the entity-factored state space and action space in an end-to-end way. DPN achieves such connections by two separate module selection networks, which consistently assign the same input module to the same input entity (guarantee PI) and assign the same output module to the same entity-related output (guarantee PE). To enhance the representation capability, HPN replaces the module selection networks of DPN with hypernetworks to directly generate the corresponding module weights. Extensive experiments in SMAC, Google Research Football and MPE validate that the proposed methods significantly boost the performance and the learning efficiency of existing MARL algorithms. Remarkably, in SMAC, we achieve 100% win rates in almost all hard and super-hard scenarios (never achieved before).			arxiv	['Hangyu Mao', 'Weixun Wang', 'Yaodong Yang', 'Dong Li', 'Yan Zheng', 'Zhen Wang', 'Jianye Hao']	421.0

Special attention in this field is given to sports video analytics which could help in identifying key events during a match and help in preparing a strategy for the games going forward. For this paper, we have chosen Football (soccer) as a sport where we would want to create highlights for a given match video, through a computer vision model that aims to identify important events in a Soccer match to create highlights of the match. We built the models based on Faster RCNN and YoloV5 architectures and noticed that for the amount of data we used for training Faster RCNN did better than YoloV5 in detecting the events in the match though it was much slower. Within Faster RCNN using ResNet50 as a base model gave a better class accuracy of 95.5% as compared to 92% with VGG16 as base model completely outperforming YoloV5 for our training dataset. We tested with an original video of size 23 minutes and our model could reduce it to 4:50 minutes of highlights capturing almost all important events in the match.			arxiv	['Prashant Kumar', 'Nikhil Malhotra', 'Vigneswaran Sundaramurthy', 'Abhaya Thakur', 'Shivam Chauhan', 'Krishna Chaitanya Thangeda', 'Anwesh Reddy Paduri']	422.0
955	LDSA: Learning Dynamic Subtask Assignment in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning	Mingyu Yang	2022-05-05 10:46:16	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02561v3	Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made prominent progress in recent years. For training efficiency and scalability, most of the MARL algorithms make all agents share the same policy or value network. However, in many complex multi-agent tasks, different agents are expected to possess specific abilities to handle different subtasks. In those scenarios, sharing parameters indiscriminately may lead to similar behavior across all agents, which will limit the exploration efficiency and degrade the final performance. To balance the training complexity and the diversity of agent behavior, we propose a novel framework to learn dynamic subtask assignment (LDSA) in cooperative MARL. Specifically, we first introduce a subtask encoder to construct a vector representation for each subtask according to its identity. To reasonably assign agents to different subtasks, we propose an ability-based subtask selection strategy, which can dynamically group agents with similar abilities into the same subtask. In this way, agents dealing with the same subtask share their learning of specific abilities and different subtasks correspond to different specific abilities. We further introduce two regularizers to increase the representation difference between subtasks and stabilize the training by discouraging agents from frequently changing subtasks, respectively. Empirical results show that LDSA learns reasonable and effective subtask assignment for better collaboration and significantly improves the learning performance on the challenging StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark and Google Research Football.			arxiv	['Jian Zhao', 'Xunhan Hu', 'Wengang Zhou', 'Jiangcheng Zhu', 'Houqiang Li']	423.0

In many computer vision tasks, such as image classification, such methods achieve state-of-the-art results that surpass supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we investigate whether SSL methods can be leveraged for the task of learning accurate state representations of games, and if so, to what extent. For this purpose, we collect game footage frames and corresponding sequences of games' internal state from three different 3D games: VizDoom, the CARLA racing simulator and the Google Research Football Environment. We train an image encoder with three widely used SSL algorithms using solely the raw frames, and then attempt to recover the internal state variables from the learned representations. Our results across all three games showcase significantly higher correlation between SSL representations and the game's internal state compared to pre-trained baseline models such as ImageNet. Such findings suggest that SSL-based visual encoders can yield general -- not tailored to a specific task -- yet informative game representations solely from game pixel information. Such representations can, in turn, form the basis for boosting the performance of downstream learning tasks in games, including gameplaying, content generation and player modeling.			arxiv	['Konstantinos Makantasis', 'Antonios Liapis', 'Georgios N.

957	Revisiting Some Common Practices in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning	Wei Fu	2022-06-15 13:03:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07505v2	Many advances in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) are based on two common design principles: value decomposition and parameter sharing. A typical MARL algorithm of this fashion decomposes a centralized Q-function into local Q-networks with parameters shared across agents. Such an algorithmic paradigm enables centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) and leads to efficient learning in practice. Despite all the advantages, we revisit these two principles and show that in certain scenarios, e.g., environments with a highly multi-modal reward landscape, value decomposition, and parameter sharing can be problematic and lead to undesired outcomes. In contrast, policy gradient (PG) methods with individual policies provably converge to an optimal solution in these cases, which partially supports some recent empirical observations that PG can be effective in many MARL testbeds. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we present practical suggestions on implementing multi-agent PG algorithms for either high rewards or diverse emergent behaviors and empirically validate our findings on a variety of domains, ranging from the simplified matrix and grid-world games to complex benchmarks such as StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Google Research Football. We hope our insights could benefit the community towards developing more general and more powerful MARL algorithms.

However, previous works mainly consider static, pair-wise interactions with limited relational reasoning. To promote more comprehensive interaction modeling and relational reasoning, we propose DynGroupNet, a dynamic-group-aware network, which can i) model time-varying interactions in highly dynamic scenes; ii) capture both pair-wise and group-wise interactions; and iii) reason both interaction strength and category without direct supervision. Based on DynGroupNet, we further design a prediction system to forecast socially plausible trajectories with dynamic relational reasoning. The proposed prediction system leverages the Gaussian mixture model, multiple sampling and prediction refinement to promote prediction diversity, training stability and trajectory smoothness, respectively. Extensive experiments show that: 1)DynGroupNet can capture time-varying group behaviors, infer time-varying interaction category and interaction strength during trajectory prediction without any relation supervision on physical simulation datasets; 2)DynGroupNet outperforms the state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods by a significant improvement of 22.6%/28.0%, 26.9%/34.9%, 5.1%/13.0% in ADE/FDE on the NBA, NFL Football and SDD datasets and achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the ETH-UCY dataset.			arxiv	['Yuxi Wei', 'Bohan Tang', 'Sheng Yin', 'Ya Zhang', 'Siheng Chen']	426.0
959	Graph Neural Networks to Predict Sports Outcomes	Peter Xenopoulos	2022-07-28 14:45:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14124v1	"Predicting outcomes in sports is important for teams, leagues, bettors, media, and fans. Given the growing amount of player tracking data, sports analytics models are increasingly utilizing spatially-derived features built upon player tracking data. However, player-specific information, such as location, cannot readily be included as features themselves, since common modeling techniques rely on vector input. Accordingly, spatially-derived features are commonly constructed in relation to anchor objects, such as the distance to a ball or goal, through global feature aggregations, or via role-assignment schemes, where players are designated a distinct role in the game. In doing so, we sacrifice inter-player and local relationships in favor of global ones. To address this issue, we introduce a sport-agnostic graph-based representation of game states. We then use our proposed graph representation as input to graph neural networks to predict sports outcomes. Our approach preserves permutation invariance and allows for flexible player interaction weights. We demonstrate how our method provides statistically significant improvements over the state of the art for prediction tasks in both American football and esports, reducing test set loss by 9% and 20%, respectively. Additionally, we show how our model can be used to answer ""what if"" questions in sports and to visualize relationships between players."			arxiv	['Claudio Silva']	427.0
960	Lamarckian Platform: Pushing the Boundaries of Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning towards Asynchronous Commercial Games	Hui Bai	2022-09-21 00:55:55	http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10055v1	Despite the emerging progress of integrating evolutionary computation into reinforcement learning, the absence of a high-performance platform endowing composability and massive parallelism causes non-trivial difficulties for research and applications related to asynchronous commercial games. Here we introduce Lamarckian - an open-source platform featuring support for evolutionary reinforcement learning scalable to distributed computing resources. To improve the training speed and data efficiency, Lamarckian adopts optimized communication methods and an asynchronous evolutionary reinforcement learning workflow. To meet the demand for an asynchronous interface by commercial games and various methods, Lamarckian tailors an asynchronous Markov Decision Process interface and designs an object-oriented software architecture with decoupled modules. In comparison with the state-of-the-art RLlib, we empirically demonstrate the unique advantages of Lamarckian on benchmark tests with up to 6000 CPU cores: i) both the sampling efficiency and training speed are doubled when running PPO on Google football game; ii) the training speed is 13 times faster when running PBT+PPO on Pong game. Moreover, we also present two use cases: i) how Lamarckian is applied to generating behavior-diverse game AI; ii) how Lamarckian is applied to game balancing tests for an asynchronous commercial game.			arxiv	['Ruimin Shen', 'Yue Lin', 'Botian Xu', 'Ran Cheng']	428.0

However, multi-actor tracking over humans with similar appearance and nonlinear movement can still be very challenging even for the state-of-the-art tracking algorithm. Current motion-based tracking algorithms often use Kalman Filter to predict the motion of an object, however, its linear movement assumption can cause failure in tracking when the target is not moving linearly. And for multi-players tracking over the sports field, because the players in the same team are usually wearing the same color of jersey, making re-identification even harder both in the short term and long term in the tracking process. In this work, we proposed a motionbased tracking algorithm and three post-processing pipelines for three sports including basketball, football, and volleyball, we successfully handle the tracking of the non-linear movement of players on the sports fields. Experiments result on the testing set of ECCV DeeperAction Challenge SportsMOT Dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves a HOTA of 73.968, ranking 3rd place on the 2022 Sportsmot workshop final leaderboard.			arxiv	['Cheng-Yen Yang', 'Jenq-Neng Hwang', 'Pyong-Kun Kim', 'Kwangju Kim', 'Kyoungoh Lee']	429.0
962	Towards Multimodal Prediction of Spontaneous Humour: A Novel Dataset and First Results	Lukas Christ	2022-09-28 17:36:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14272v2	Humour is a substantial element of human affect and cognition. Its automatic understanding can facilitate a more naturalistic human-device interaction and the humanisation of artificial intelligence. Current methods of humour detection are solely based on staged data making them inadequate for 'real-world' applications. We address this deficiency by introducing the novel Passau-Spontaneous Football Coach Humour (Passau-SFCH) dataset, comprising of about 11 hours of recordings. The Passau-SFCH dataset is annotated for the presence of humour and its dimensions (sentiment and direction) as proposed in Martin's Humor Style Questionnaire. We conduct a series of experiments, employing pretrained Transformers, convolutional neural networks, and expert-designed features. The performance of each modality (text, audio, video) for spontaneous humour recognition is analysed and their complementarity is investigated. Our findings suggest that for the automatic analysis of humour and its sentiment, facial expressions are most promising, while humour direction can be best modelled via text-based features. The results reveal considerable differences among various subjects, highlighting the individuality of humour usage and style. Further, we observe that a decision-level fusion yields the best recognition result. Finally, we make our code publicly available at https://www.github.com/EIHW/passau-sfch. The Passau-SFCH dataset is available upon request.			arxiv	['Shahin Amiriparian', 'Alexander Kathan', 'Niklas Müller', 'Andreas König', 'Björn W. Schuller']	430.0
963	Brain structure can mediate or moderate the relationship of behavior to brain function and transcriptome. A preliminary study	Sumra Bari	2022-10-06 20:26:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03195v1	Abnormalities in motor-control behavior, which have been with concussion and head acceleration events (HAE), can be quantified using virtual reality (VR) technologies. Motor-control behavior has been consistently mapped to the brain's somatomotor network (SM) using both structural (sMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI). However, no studies habe integrated HAE, motor-control behavior, sMRI and fMRI measures. Here, brain networks important for motor-control were hypothesized to show changes in tractography-based diffusion weighted imaging [difference in fractional anisotropy (dFA)] and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) measures in collegiate American football players across the season, and that these measures would relate to VR-based motor-control. We firther tested if nine inflammation-related miRNAs were associated with behavior-structure-function variables. Using permutation-based mediation and moderation methods, we found that across-season dFA from the SM structural connectome (SM-dFA) mediated the relationship between across-season VR-based Sensory-motor Reactivity (dSR) and rs-fMRI SM fingerprint similarity (p = 0.007 and Teff = 47%). The interaction between dSR and SM-dFA also predicted (pF = 0.036, pbeta3 = 0.058) across-season levels of dmiRNA-30d through permutation-based moderation analysis. These results suggest (1) that motor-control is in a feedback relationship with brain structure and function, (2) behavior-structure-function can be connected to HAE, and (3) behavior-structure might predict molecular biology measures.			arxiv	['Nicole L Vike', 'Khrystyna Stetsiv', 'Anne J Blood', 'Eric A Nauman', 'Thomas M Talavage', 'Semyon Slobounov', 'Hans C Breiter']	431.0
964	ELIGN: Expectation Alignment as a Multi-Agent Intrinsic Reward	Zixian Ma	2022-10-09 22:24:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04365v2	Modern multi-agent reinforcement learning frameworks rely on centralized training and reward shaping to perform well. However, centralized training and dense rewards are not readily available in the real world. Current multi-agent algorithms struggle to learn in the alternative setup of decentralized training or sparse rewards. To address these issues, we propose a self-supervised intrinsic reward ELIGN - expectation alignment - inspired by the self-organization principle in Zoology. Similar to how animals collaborate in a decentralized manner with those in their vicinity, agents trained with expectation alignment learn behaviors that match their neighbors' expectations. This allows the agents to learn collaborative behaviors without any external reward or centralized training. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across 6 tasks in the multi-agent particle and the complex Google Research football environments, comparing ELIGN to sparse and curiosity-based intrinsic rewards. When the number of agents increases, ELIGN scales well in all multi-agent tasks except for one where agents have different capabilities. We show that agent coordination improves through expectation alignment because agents learn to divide tasks amongst themselves, break coordination symmetries, and confuse adversaries. These results identify tasks where expectation alignment is a more useful strategy than curiosity-driven exploration for multi-agent coordination, enabling agents to do zero-shot coordination.			arxiv	['Rose Wang', 'Li Fei-Fei', 'Michael Bernstein', 'Ranjay Krishna']	432.0
965	Pre-analysis protocol for an observational study on the effects of adolescent sports participation on health in early adulthood	Ajinkya H Kokandakar	2022-11-03 19:15:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02104v3	We will study the impact of adolescent sports participation on early-adulthood health using longitudinal data from the National Study of Youth and Religion. We focus on two primary outcomes measured at ages 23--28 -- self-rated health and total score on the PHQ9 Patient Depression Questionnaire -- and control for several potential confounders related to demographics and family socioeconomic status. Comparing outcomes between sports participants and matched non-sports participants with similar confounders is straightforward. Unfortunately, an analysis based on such a broad exposure cannot probe the possibility that participation in certain types of sports (e.g., collision sports like football or soccer) may have larger effects on health than others. In this study, we introduce a hierarchy of exposure definitions, ranging from broad (participation in any after-school organized activity) to narrow (e.g., participation in limited-contact sports). We will perform separate matched observational studies, one for each definition, to estimate the health effects of several levels of sports participation. In order to conduct these studies while maintaining a fixed family-wise error rate, we deployed an ordered testing approach that exploits the logical relationships between exposure definitions. Our study will also consider several secondary outcomes including body mass index, life satisfaction, and problematic drinking behavior.			arxiv	['Yuzhou Lin', 'Steven Jin', 'Jordan Weiss', 'Amanda R Rabinowitz', 'Reuben A Buford May', 'Dylan Small', 'Sameer K Deshpande']	433.0
966	ACE: Cooperative Multi-agent Q-learning with Bidirectional Action-Dependency	Chuming Li	2022-11-29 10:22:55	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16068v2	Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) suffers from the non-stationarity problem, which is the ever-changing targets at every iteration when multiple agents update their policies at the same time. Starting from first principle, in this paper, we manage to solve the non-stationarity problem by proposing bidirectional action-dependent Q-learning (ACE). Central to the development of ACE is the sequential decision-making process wherein only one agent is allowed to take action at one time. Within this process, each agent maximizes its value function given the actions taken by the preceding agents at the inference stage. In the learning phase, each agent minimizes the TD error that is dependent on how the subsequent agents have reacted to their chosen action. Given the design of bidirectional dependency, ACE effectively turns a multiagent MDP into a single-agent MDP. We implement the ACE framework by identifying the proper network representation to formulate the action dependency, so that the sequential decision process is computed implicitly in one forward pass. To validate ACE, we compare it with strong baselines on two MARL benchmarks. Empirical experiments demonstrate that ACE outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms on Google Research Football and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge by a large margin. In particular, on SMAC tasks, ACE achieves 100% success rate on almost all the hard and super-hard maps. We further study extensive research problems regarding ACE, including extension, generalization, and practicability. Code is made available to facilitate further research.			arxiv	['Jie Liu', 'Yinmin Zhang', 'Yuhong Wei', 'Yazhe Niu', 'Yaodong Yang', 'Yu Liu', 'Wanli Ouyang']	434.0
967	Denoising instrumented mouthguard measurements of head impact kinematics with a convolutional neural network	Xianghao Zhan	2022-12-19 20:08:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09832v1	Wearable sensors for measuring head kinematics can be noisy due to imperfect interfaces with the body. Mouthguards are used to measure head kinematics during impacts in traumatic brain injury (TBI) studies, but deviations from reference kinematics can still occur due to potential looseness. In this study, deep learning is used to compensate for the imperfect interface and improve measurement accuracy. A set of one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) models was developed to denoise mouthguard kinematics measurements along three spatial axes of linear acceleration and angular velocity. The denoised kinematics had significantly reduced errors compared to reference kinematics, and reduced errors in brain injury criteria and tissue strain and strain rate calculated via finite element modeling. The 1D-CNN models were also tested on an on-field dataset of college football impacts and a post-mortem human subject dataset, with similar denoising effects observed. The models can be used to improve detection of head impacts and TBI risk evaluation, and potentially extended to other sensors measuring kinematics.			arxiv	['Yuzhe Liu', 'Nicholas J.

968	Evidence-based policy-making in sports funding using a data-driven optimization approach	Jan Hurt	2022-12-21 13:55:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11018v1	Many European countries face rising obesity rates among children, compounded by decreased opportunities for sports activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Access to sports facilities depends on multiple factors, such as geographic location, proximity to population centers, budgetary constraints, and other socio-economic covariates. Here we show how an optimal allocation of government funds towards sports facilitators (e.g. sports clubs) can be achieved in a data-driven simulation model that maximizes children's access to sports facilities. We compile a dataset for all 1,854 football clubs in Austria, including estimates for their budget, geolocation, tally, and the age profile of their members. We find a characteristic sub-linear relationship between the number of active club members and the budget, which depends on the socio-economic conditions of the clubs' municipality. In the model, where we assume this relationship to be causal, we evaluate different funding strategies. We show that an optimization strategy where funds are distributed based on regional socio-economic characteristics and club budgets outperforms a naive approach by up to 117\% in attracting children to sports clubs for 5 million Euros of additional funding. Our results suggest that the impact of public funding strategies can be substantially increased by tailoring them to regional socio-economic characteristics in an evidence-based and individualized way.			arxiv	['Liuhuaying Yang', 'Johannes Sorger', 'Thomas J.

969	Inferring Player Location in Sports Matches: Multi-Agent Spatial Imputation from Limited Observations	Gregory Everett	2023-02-13 18:13:29	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06569v1	Understanding agent behaviour in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) is an important problem in domains such as autonomous driving, disaster response, and sports analytics. Existing MAS problems typically use uniform timesteps with observations for all agents. In this work, we analyse the problem of agent location imputation, specifically posed in environments with non-uniform timesteps and limited agent observability (~95% missing values). Our approach uses Long Short-Term Memory and Graph Neural Network components to learn temporal and inter-agent patterns to predict the location of all agents at every timestep. We apply this to the domain of football (soccer) by imputing the location of all players in a game from sparse event data (e.g., shots and passes). Our model estimates player locations to within ~6.9m; a ~62% reduction in error from the best performing baseline. This approach facilitates downstream analysis tasks such as player physical metrics, player coverage, and team pitch control. Existing solutions to these tasks often require optical tracking data, which is expensive to obtain and only available to elite clubs. By imputing player locations from easy to obtain event data, we increase the accessibility of downstream tasks.			arxiv	['Ryan J. Beal', 'Tim Matthews', 'Joseph Early', 'Timothy J.

970	Identification of pattern mining algorithm for rugby league players positional groups separation based on movement patterns	Victor Elijah Adeyemo	2023-02-25 12:23:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14058v1	The application of pattern mining algorithms to extract movement patterns from sports big data can improve training specificity by facilitating a more granular evaluation of movement. As there are various pattern mining algorithms, this study aimed to validate which algorithm discovers the best set of movement patterns for player movement profiling in professional rugby league and the similarity in extracted movement patterns between the algorithms. Three pattern mining algorithms (l-length Closed Contiguous [LCCspm], Longest Common Subsequence [LCS] and AprioriClose) were used to profile elite rugby football league hookers (n = 22 players) and wingers (n = 28 players) match-games movements across 319 matches. Machine learning classification algorithms were used to identify which algorithm gives the best set of movement patterns to separate playing positions with Jaccard similarity score identifying the extent of similarity between algorithms' movement patterns. LCCspm and LCS movement patterns shared a 0.19 Jaccard similarity score. AprioriClose movement patterns shared no significant similarity with LCCspm and LCS patterns. The closed contiguous movement patterns profiled by LCCspm best-separated players into playing positions. Multi-layered Perceptron algorithm achieved the highest accuracy of 91.02% and precision, recall and F1 scores of 0.91 respectively. Therefore, we recommend the extraction of closed contiguous (consecutive) over non-consecutive movement patterns for separating groups of players.			arxiv	['Anna Palczewska', 'Ben Jones', 'Dan Weaving']	438.0
971	NFL Career Success as Predicted by NFL Scouting Combine	Brian Szekely	2023-03-10 08:19:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05774v1	The National Football League (NFL) Scouting Combine serves as a tool to evaluate the skills of prospective players and assess their readiness to play in the NFL. The development of machine learning brings new opportunities in assessing the utility of the Scouting Combine. Using machine and statistical learning, it may be possible to predict future success of prospective athletes, as well as predict which Scouting Combine tests are the most important. Results from statistical learning research have been contradicting whether the Scouting combine is a useful metric for player success. In this study, we investigate if machine learning can be used to determine matriculation and future success in the NFL. Using Scouting Combine data, we evaluate six different algorithms' ability to predict whether a potential draft pick will play a single NFL snap (matriculation). If a player is drafted, we predict how many snaps they go on to play (success). We are able to predict matriculation with 83% accuracy; however, we are unable to predict later success. Our best performing algorithm returns large error and low explained variance (RMSE=1,210 snaps; ${R}^2$=0.17). These findings indicate that while the Scouting Combine can predict NFL matriculation, it may not be a reliable predictor of long-term player success.			arxiv	['Christian Sinnott', 'Savannah Halow', 'Gregory Ryan']	439.0

A Vision-and-Language Benchmark of Synthetic and Compositional Images	Nitzan Bitton-Guetta	2023-03-13 16:49:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07274v4	Weird, unusual, and uncanny images pique the curiosity of observers because they challenge commonsense. For example, an image released during the 2022 world cup depicts the famous soccer stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo playing chess, which playfully violates our expectation that their competition should occur on the football field. Humans can easily recognize and interpret these unconventional images, but can AI models do the same? We introduce WHOOPS!, a new dataset and benchmark for visual commonsense. The dataset is comprised of purposefully commonsense-defying images created by designers using publicly-available image generation tools like Midjourney. We consider several tasks posed over the dataset. In addition to image captioning, cross-modal matching, and visual question answering, we introduce a difficult explanation generation task, where models must identify and explain why a given image is unusual. Our results show that state-of-the-art models such as GPT3 and BLIP2 still lag behind human performance on WHOOPS!. We hope our dataset will inspire the development of AI models with stronger visual commonsense reasoning abilities.

By construction of these events, participants must distinguish the spheroidal ball from not only the background, but also their team and enemy players, which are marked by self-assigned linear combinations of specific frequencies of electromagnetic magnetic radiation, known as uniform color. We investigate chromatic effects on the outcome of such events. We do this by finding the correlation between the color contrast and the success of several key spheroidal ball match tactics. We perform this analysis for the 2020 NFL regular season, focusing on moves in which uniform colors may be a factor in performance. We conduct a primary analysis using each team's cumulative results over the season, but in doing so neglect non-uniformity in the chosen uniform color per individual. We then conduct a secondary analysis of the performance per game of a single team, the Seattle Seahawks, which exhibited large uniform color variability for the 2020 NFL regular season. In this work, tackles and completions are considered. The Pearson correlation coefficient is then calculated for both tactics. We find little evidence of chromaticity effects, with correlation values of $r_t=-0.0885\pm 0.1819$ and $r_c-0.0292\pm0.1825 $, respectively, for the primary analysis.			arxiv	['Michael Pagano']	441.0
974	SportsMOT: A Large Multi-Object Tracking Dataset in Multiple Sports Scenes	Yutao Cui	2023-04-11 12:07:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05170v2	Multi-object tracking in sports scenes plays a critical role in gathering players statistics, supporting further analysis, such as automatic tactical analysis. Yet existing MOT benchmarks cast little attention on the domain, limiting its development. In this work, we present a new large-scale multi-object tracking dataset in diverse sports scenes, coined as \emph{SportsMOT}, where all players on the court are supposed to be tracked. It consists of 240 video sequences, over 150K frames (almost 15\times MOT17) and over 1.6M bounding boxes (3\times MOT17) collected from 3 sports categories, including basketball, volleyball and football. Our dataset is characterized with two key properties: 1) fast and variable-speed motion and 2) similar yet distinguishable appearance. We expect SportsMOT to encourage the MOT trackers to promote in both motion-based association and appearance-based association. We benchmark several state-of-the-art trackers and reveal the key challenge of SportsMOT lies in object association. To alleviate the issue, we further propose a new multi-object tracking framework, termed as \emph{MixSort}, introducing a MixFormer-like structure as an auxiliary association model to prevailing tracking-by-detection trackers. By integrating the customized appearance-based association with the original motion-based association, MixSort achieves state-of-the-art performance on SportsMOT and MOT17. Based on MixSort, we give an in-depth analysis and provide some profound insights into SportsMOT. The dataset and code will be available at https://deeperaction.github.io/datasets/sportsmot.html.			arxiv	['Chenkai Zeng', 'Xiaoyu Zhao', 'Yichun Yang', 'Gangshan Wu', 'Limin Wang']	442.0
975	Is Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution Framework Centralized Enough for MARL?	Yihe Zhou	2023-05-27 03:15:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17352v1	Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has recently emerged as a popular framework for cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), where agents can use additional global state information to guide training in a centralized way and make their own decisions only based on decentralized local policies. Despite the encouraging results achieved, CTDE makes an independence assumption on agent policies, which limits agents to adopt global cooperative information from each other during centralized training. Therefore, we argue that existing CTDE methods cannot fully utilize global information for training, leading to an inefficient joint-policy exploration and even suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce a novel Centralized Advising and Decentralized Pruning (CADP) framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning, that not only enables an efficacious message exchange among agents during training but also guarantees the independent policies for execution. Firstly, CADP endows agents the explicit communication channel to seek and take advices from different agents for more centralized training. To further ensure the decentralized execution, we propose a smooth model pruning mechanism to progressively constraint the agent communication into a closed one without degradation in agent cooperation capability. Empirical evaluations on StarCraft II micromanagement and Google Research Football benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. Our code will be made publicly available.			arxiv	['Shunyu Liu', 'Yunpeng Qing', 'Kaixuan Chen', 'Tongya Zheng', 'Yanhao Huang', 'Jie Song', 'Mingli Song']	443.0
976	Action valuation of on- and off-ball soccer players based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning	Hiroshi Nakahara	2023-05-29 05:14:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17886v2	Analysis of invasive sports such as soccer is challenging because the game situation changes continuously in time and space, and multiple agents individually recognize the game situation and make decisions. Previous studies using deep reinforcement learning have often considered teams as a single agent and valued the teams and players who hold the ball in each discrete event. Then it was challenging to value the actions of multiple players, including players far from the ball, in a spatiotemporally continuous state space. In this paper, we propose a method of valuing possible actions for on- and off-ball soccer players in a single holistic framework based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. We consider a discrete action space in a continuous state space that mimics that of Google research football and leverages supervised learning for actions in reinforcement learning. In the experiment, we analyzed the relationships with conventional indicators, season goals, and game ratings by experts, and showed the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our approach can assess how multiple players move continuously throughout the game, which is difficult to be discretized or labeled but vital for teamwork, scouting, and fan engagement.			arxiv	['Kazushi Tsutsui', 'Kazuya Takeda', 'Keisuke Fujii']	444.0
977	Maximum Entropy Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning	Jiarong Liu	2023-06-19 06:22:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10715v3	Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been shown effective for cooperative games in recent years. However, existing state-of-the-art methods face challenges related to sample complexity, training instability, and the risk of converging to a suboptimal Nash Equilibrium. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for learning stochastic policies to resolve these issues. We embed cooperative MARL problems into probabilistic graphical models, from which we derive the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) objective for MARL. Based on the MaxEnt framework, we propose Heterogeneous-Agent Soft Actor-Critic (HASAC) algorithm. Theoretically, we prove the monotonic improvement and convergence to quantal response equilibrium (QRE) properties of HASAC. Furthermore, we generalize a unified template for MaxEnt algorithmic design named Maximum Entropy Heterogeneous-Agent Mirror Learning (MEHAML), which provides any induced method with the same guarantees as HASAC. We evaluate HASAC on six benchmarks: Bi-DexHands, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, Google Research Football, Multi-Agent Particle Environment, and Light Aircraft Game. Results show that HASAC consistently outperforms strong baselines, exhibiting better sample efficiency, robustness, and sufficient exploration.

To simulate this game and attract scientists from all over the world to conduct research and participate in an annual computer-based soccer world cup, Soccer Simulation 2D (SS2D) was one of the leagues initiated in the RoboCup competition. In every SS2D game, two teams of 11 players and one coach connect to the RoboCup Soccer Simulation Server and compete against each other. Over the past few years, several C++ base codes have been employed to control agents' behavior and their communication with the server. Although C++ base codes have laid the foundation for the SS2D, developing them requires an advanced level of C++ programming. C++ language complexity is a limiting disadvantage of C++ base codes for all users, especially for beginners. To conquer the challenges of C++ base codes and provide a powerful baseline for developing machine learning concepts, we introduce Pyrus, the first Python base code for SS2D. Pyrus is developed to encourage researchers to efficiently develop their ideas and integrate machine learning algorithms into their teams.

We investigated this fundamental aspect of motor control in the setting of autonomous robotic operations. We approach this problem by hierarchical generative modelling equipped with multi-level planning-for autonomous task completion-that mimics the deep temporal architecture of human motor control. Here, temporal depth refers to the nested time scales at which successive levels of a forward or generative model unfold, for example, delivering an object requires a global plan to contextualise the fast coordination of multiple local movements of limbs. This separation of temporal scales also motivates robotics and control. Specifically, to achieve versatile sensorimotor control, it is advantageous to hierarchically structure the planning and low-level motor control of individual limbs. We use numerical and physical simulation to conduct experiments and to establish the efficacy of this formulation. Using a hierarchical generative model, we show how a humanoid robot can autonomously complete a complex task that necessitates a holistic use of locomotion, manipulation, and grasping. Specifically, we demonstrate the ability of a humanoid robot that can retrieve and transport a box, open and walk through a door to reach the destination, approach and kick a football, while showing robust performance in presence of body damage and ground irregularities. Our findings demonstrated the effectiveness of using human-inspired motor control algorithms, and our method provides a viable hierarchical architecture for the autonomous completion of challenging goal-directed tasks.			arxiv	['Noor Sajid', 'Karl Friston', 'Zhibin Li']	447.0
980	Fictitious Cross-Play: Learning Global Nash Equilibrium in Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Games	Zelai Xu	2023-10-05 07:19:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03354v1	Self-play (SP) is a popular multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for solving competitive games, where each agent optimizes policy by treating others as part of the environment. Despite the empirical successes, the theoretical properties of SP-based methods are limited to two-player zero-sum games. However, for mixed cooperative-competitive games where agents on the same team need to cooperate with each other, we can show a simple counter-example where SP-based methods cannot converge to a global Nash equilibrium (NE) with high probability. Alternatively, Policy-Space Response Oracles (PSRO) is an iterative framework for learning NE, where the best responses w.r.t. previous policies are learned in each iteration. PSRO can be directly extended to mixed cooperative-competitive settings by jointly learning team best responses with all convergence properties unchanged. However, PSRO requires repeatedly training joint policies from scratch till convergence, which makes it hard to scale to complex games. In this work, we develop a novel algorithm, Fictitious Cross-Play (FXP), which inherits the benefits from both frameworks. FXP simultaneously trains an SP-based main policy and a counter population of best response policies. The main policy is trained by fictitious self-play and cross-play against the counter population, while the counter policies are trained as the best responses to the main policy's past versions. We validate our method in matrix games and show that FXP converges to global NEs while SP methods fail. We also conduct experiments in a gridworld domain, where FXP achieves higher Elo ratings and lower exploitabilities than baselines, and a more challenging football game, where FXP defeats SOTA models with over 94% win rate.			arxiv	['Yancheng Liang', 'Chao Yu', 'Yu Wang', 'Yi Wu']	448.0

Curriculum learning is an effective way to accelerate learning, but an under-explored dimension for generating a curriculum is the difficulty-to-learn of the subgames -- games induced by starting from a specific state. In this work, we present a novel subgame curriculum learning framework for zero-sum games. It adopts an adaptive initial state distribution by resetting agents to some previously visited states where they can quickly learn to improve performance. Building upon this framework, we derive a subgame selection metric that approximates the squared distance to NE values and further adopt a particle-based state sampler for subgame generation. Integrating these techniques leads to our new algorithm, Subgame Automatic Curriculum Learning (SACL), which is a realization of the subgame curriculum learning framework. SACL can be combined with any MARL algorithm such as MAPPO. Experiments in the particle-world environment and Google Research Football environment show SACL produces much stronger policies than baselines. In the challenging hide-and-seek quadrant environment, SACL produces all four emergent stages and uses only half the samples of MAPPO with self-play.

Originally, it was proposed for the ranking system of chess players, but it was soon adapted to many other zero-sum sports fields like football, baseball, basketball , etc. Nowadays, besides the traditional sports games, computer/video games are also playing an important role in social lives especially among the teenagers. In most of the online competition games, player's performance is usually scored and recorded by the game's ranking system. Meanwhile, ranking system like ladder in Dota is not the only the metric for the players to evaluate their gaming strength, an ELO rating score based on players in-game performance is also a decisive factor for gamers' matching. Namely, the matching system will refer to players' score in the ranking system and performance score system to ensure the matched players will promisingly undergo a balanced game without one team dramatically overwhelming the other. ELO scheme and its variants in modern online competition games aims to ensuring the expected winning rate for each team approaches 50\%. However, ELO rating is also causing compliments among players. In this research, I will dig into the advantages and drawbacks of leveraging ELO ranking system in online games and why it is still employed by game developers despite the fact that it is disliked by most of the players. Also, a new effort based rating scheme will be proposed and compared with ELO scheme under the simulation environment.			arxiv	[]	450.0

However, training a multi-agent reinforcement learning network is a formidable endeavor, demanding substantial computational resources to interact with diverse environmental variables, extract state representations, and acquire decision-making knowledge. The recent breakthroughs in large-scale pre-trained models ignite our curiosity: Can we uncover shared knowledge in multi-agent reinforcement learning and leverage pre-trained models to expedite training for future tasks? Addressing this issue, we present an innovative multi-task learning approach that aims to extract and harness common decision-making knowledge, like cooperation and competition, across different tasks. Our approach involves concurrent training of multiple multi-agent tasks, with each task employing independent front-end perception layers while sharing back-end decision-making layers. This effective decoupling of state representation extraction from decision-making allows for more efficient training and better transferability. To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments in two distinct environments: the StarCraft Multi-agent Challenge (SMAC) and the Google Research Football (GRF) environments. The experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the smooth transferability of the shared decision-making network to other tasks, thereby significantly reducing training costs and improving final performance. Furthermore, visualizations authenticate the presence of general multi-agent decision-making knowledge within the shared network layers, further validating the effectiveness of our approach.			arxiv	['Jian Zhao', 'Zhengtao Cao', 'Ruili Feng', 'Rongjun Qin', 'Yang Yu']	451.0
984	TimeGraphs: Graph-based Temporal Reasoning	Paridhi Maheshwari	2024-01-06 06:26:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03134v1	Many real-world systems exhibit temporal, dynamic behaviors, which are captured as time series of complex agent interactions. To perform temporal reasoning, current methods primarily encode temporal dynamics through simple sequence-based models. However, in general these models fail to efficiently capture the full spectrum of rich dynamics in the input, since the dynamics is not uniformly distributed. In particular, relevant information might be harder to extract and computing power is wasted for processing all individual timesteps, even if they contain no significant changes or no new information. Here we propose TimeGraphs, a novel approach that characterizes dynamic interactions as a hierarchical temporal graph, diverging from traditional sequential representations. Our approach models the interactions using a compact graph-based representation, enabling adaptive reasoning across diverse time scales. Adopting a self-supervised method, TimeGraphs constructs a multi-level event hierarchy from a temporal input, which is then used to efficiently reason about the unevenly distributed dynamics. This construction process is scalable and incremental to accommodate streaming data. We evaluate TimeGraphs on multiple datasets with complex, dynamic agent interactions, including a football simulator, the Resistance game, and the MOMA human activity dataset. The results demonstrate both robustness and efficiency of TimeGraphs on a range of temporal reasoning tasks. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art performance and leads to a performance increase of up to 12.2% on event prediction and recognition tasks over current approaches. Our experiments further demonstrate a wide array of capabilities including zero-shot generalization, robustness in case of data sparsity, and adaptability to streaming data flow.			arxiv	['Hongyu Ren', 'Yanan Wang', 'Rok Sosic', 'Jure Leskovec']	452.0
985	A Networks and Machine Learning Approach to Determine the Best College Coaches of the 20th-21st Centuries	Tian-Shun Jiang	2014-04-08 22:04:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2885v1	Our objective is to find the five best college sports coaches of past century for three different sports. We decided to look at men's basketball, football, and baseball. We wanted to use an approach that could definitively determine team skill from the games played, and then use a machine-learning algorithm to calculate the correct coach skills for each team in a given year. We created a networks-based model to calculate team skill from historical game data. A digraph was created for each year in each sport. Nodes represented teams, and edges represented a game played between two teams. The arrowhead pointed towards the losing team. We calculated the team skill of each graph using a right-hand eigenvector centrality measure. This way, teams that beat good teams will be ranked higher than teams that beat mediocre teams. The eigenvector centrality rankings for most years were well correlated with tournament performance and poll-based rankings. We assumed that the relationship between coach skill $C_s$, player skill $P_s$, and team skill $T_s$ was $C_s \cdot P_s = T_s$. We then created a function to describe the probability that a given score difference would occur based on player skill and coach skill. We multiplied the probabilities of all edges in the network together to find the probability that the correct network would occur with any given player skill and coach skill matrix. We was able to determine player skill as a function of team skill and coach skill, eliminating the need to optimize two unknown matrices. The top five coaches in each year were noted, and the top coach of all time was calculated by dividing the number of times that coach ranked in the yearly top five by the years said coach had been active.			arxiv	['Zachary Polizzi', 'Christopher Yuan']	453.0
986	Footballonomics: The Anatomy of American Football; Evidence from 7 years of NFL game data	Konstantinos Pelechrinis	2016-01-17 15:21:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04302v6	Do NFL teams make rational decisions? What factors potentially affect the probability of wining a game in NFL? How can a team come back from a demoralizing interception? In this study we begin by examining the hypothesis of rational coaching, that is, coaching decisions are always rational with respect to the maximization of the expected points scored. We reject this hypothesis by analyzing the decisions made in the past 7 NFL seasons for two particular plays; (i) the Point(s) After Touchdown (PAT) and (ii) the fourth down decisions. Having rejected the rational coaching hypothesis we move on to examine how the detailed game data collected can potentially inform game-day decisions. While NFL teams personnel definitely have an intuition on which factors are crucial for winning a game, in this work we take a data-driven approach and provide quantifiable evidence using a large dataset of NFL games for the 7-year period between 2009 and 2015. In particular, we use a logistic regression model to identify the impact and the corresponding statistical significance of factors such as possession time, number of penalty yards, balance between passing and rushing offense etc. Our results clearly imply that avoiding turnovers is the best strategy for winning a game but turnovers can be overcome with letting the offense on the field for more time. Finally we combine our descriptive model with statistical bootstrap in order to provide a prediction engine for upcoming NFL games. Our evaluations indicate that even by only considering a small number of (straightforward) factors, we can achieve a very good prediction accuracy. In particular, the average accuracy during seasons 2014 and 2015 is approximately 63%. This performance is comparable to the more complicated state-of-the-art prediction systems, while it outperforms expert analysts 60% of the time.			arxiv	['Evangelos Papalexakis']	454.0
987	Accurate and Efficient Profile Matching in Knowledge Bases	Jorge Martinez-Gil	2017-06-21 14:54:54	http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06944v3	A profile describes a set of properties, e.g. a set of skills a person may have, a set of skills required for a particular job, or a set of abilities a football player may have with respect to a particular team strategy. Profile matching aims to determine how well a given profile fits to a requested profile. The approach taken in this article is grounded in a matching theory that uses filters in lattices to represent profiles, and matching values in the interval [0,1]: the higher the matching value the better is the fit. Such lattices can be derived from knowledge bases exploiting description logics to represent the knowledge about profiles. An interesting first question is, how human expertise concerning the matching can be exploited to obtain most accurate matchings. It will be shown that if a set of filters together with matching values by some human expert is given, then under some mild plausibility assumptions a matching measure can be determined such that the computed matching values preserve the rankings given by the expert. A second question concerns the efficient querying of databases of profile instances. For matching queries that result in a ranked list of profile instances matching a given one it will be shown how corresponding top-k queries can be evaluated on grounds of pre-computed matching values, which in turn allows the maintenance of the knowledge base to be decoupled from the maintenance of profile instances. In addition, it will be shown how the matching queries can be exploited for gap queries that determine how profile instances need to be extended in order to improve in the rankings. Finally, the theory of matching will be extended beyond the filters, which lead to a matching theory that exploits fuzzy sets or probabilistic logic with maximum entropy semantics. It will be shown that added fuzzy links can be captured by extending the underlying lattice.			arxiv	['Alejandra Lorena Paoletti', 'Gábor Rácz', 'Attila Sali', 'Klaus-Dieter Schewe']	455.0
988	Optimized Deployment of Millimeter Wave Networks for In-venue Regions with Stochastic Users' Orientation	Mehdi Naderi Soorki	2019-06-06 09:17:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02491v1	Millimeter wave (mmW) communication is a promising solution for providing high-capacity wireless network access. However, the benefits of mmW are limited by the fact that the channel between a mmW access point and the user equipment can stochastically change due to severe blockage of mmW links by obstacles such as the human body. Thus, one main challenge of mmW network coverage is to enable directional line-of-sight links between access points and mobile devices. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for optimizing mmW network coverage within hotspots and in-venue regions, while being cognizant of the body blockage of the network's users. In the studied model, the locations of potential access points and users are assumed as predefined parameters while the orientation of the users is assumed to be stochastic. Hence, a joint stochastic access point placement and beam steering problem subjected to stochastic users' body blockage is formulated, under desired network coverage constraints. Then, a greedy algorithm is introduced to find an approximation solution for the joint deployment and assignment problem using a new `size constrained weighted set cover' approach. A closed-form expression for the ratio between the optimal solution and approximate one (resulting from the greedy algorithm) is analytically derived. The proposed algorithm is simulated for three in-venue regions: the meeting room in the Alumni Assembly Hall of Virginia Tech, an airport gate, and one side of a stadium football. Simulation results show that, in order to guarantee network coverage for different in-venue regions, the greedy algorithm uses at most three more access points (APs) compared to the optimal solution. The results also show that, due to the use of the additional APs, the greedy algorithm will yield a network coverage up to 11.7 % better than the optimal, AP-minimizing solution.			arxiv	['Walid Saad', 'Mehdi Bennis']	456.0
989	Two-Sample Testing on Ranked Preference Data and the Role of Modeling Assumptions	Charvi Rastogi	2020-06-21 20:51:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11909v2	A number of applications require two-sample testing on ranked preference data. For instance, in crowdsourcing, there is a long-standing question of whether pairwise comparison data provided by people is distributed similar to ratings-converted-to-comparisons. Other examples include sports data analysis and peer grading. In this paper, we design two-sample tests for pairwise comparison data and ranking data. For our two-sample test for pairwise comparison data, we establish an upper bound on the sample complexity required to correctly distinguish between the distributions of the two sets of samples. Our test requires essentially no assumptions on the distributions. We then prove complementary lower bounds showing that our results are tight (in the minimax sense) up to constant factors. We investigate the role of modeling assumptions by proving lower bounds for a range of pairwise comparison models (WST, MST,SST, parameter-based such as BTL and Thurstone). We also provide testing algorithms and associated sample complexity bounds for the problem of two-sample testing with partial (or total) ranking data.Furthermore, we empirically evaluate our results via extensive simulations as well as two real-world datasets consisting of pairwise comparisons. By applying our two-sample test on real-world pairwise comparison data, we conclude that ratings and rankings provided by people are indeed distributed differently. On the other hand, our test recognizes no significant difference in the relative performance of European football teams across two seasons. Finally, we apply our two-sample test on a real-world partial and total ranking dataset and find a statistically significant difference in Sushi preferences across demographic divisions based on gender, age and region of residence.			arxiv	['Sivaraman Balakrishnan', 'Nihar B.

990	Enhancing Unsupervised Video Representation Learning by Decoupling the Scene and the Motion	Jinpeng Wang	2020-09-12 09:54:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05757v3	One significant factor we expect the video representation learning to capture, especially in contrast with the image representation learning, is the object motion. However, we found that in the current mainstream video datasets, some action categories are highly related with the scene where the action happens, making the model tend to degrade to a solution where only the scene information is encoded. For example, a trained model may predict a video as playing football simply because it sees the field, neglecting that the subject is dancing as a cheerleader on the field. This is against our original intention towards the video representation learning and may bring scene bias on different dataset that can not be ignored. In order to tackle this problem, we propose to decouple the scene and the motion (DSM) with two simple operations, so that the model attention towards the motion information is better paid. Specifically, we construct a positive clip and a negative clip for each video. Compared to the original video, the positive/negative is motion-untouched/broken but scene-broken/untouched by Spatial Local Disturbance and Temporal Local Disturbance. Our objective is to pull the positive closer while pushing the negative farther to the original clip in the latent space. In this way, the impact of the scene is weakened while the temporal sensitivity of the network is further enhanced. We conduct experiments on two tasks with various backbones and different pre-training datasets, and find that our method surpass the SOTA methods with a remarkable 8.1% and 8.8% improvement towards action recognition task on the UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets respectively using the same backbone.			arxiv	['Yuting Gao', 'Ke Li', 'Jianguo Hu', 'Xinyang Jiang', 'Xiaowei Guo', 'Rongrong Ji', 'Xing Sun']	458.0
991	A New Open-Access Platform for Measuring and Sharing mTBI Data	August G. Domel	2020-10-16 16:37:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08485v1	Despite numerous research efforts, the precise mechanisms of concussion have yet to be fully uncovered. Clinical studies on high-risk populations, such as contact sports athletes, have become more common and give insight on the link between impact severity and brain injury risk through the use of wearable sensors and neurological testing. However, as the number of institutions operating these studies grows, there is a growing need for a platform to share these data to facilitate our understanding of concussion mechanisms and aid in the development of suitable diagnostic tools. To that end, this paper puts forth two contributions: 1) a centralized, open-source platform for storing and sharing head impact data, in collaboration with the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research informatics system (FITBIR), and 2) a deep learning impact detection algorithm (MiGNet) to differentiate between true head impacts and false positives for the previously biomechanically validated instrumented mouthguard sensor (MiG2.0), all of which easily interfaces with FITBIR. We report 96% accuracy using MiGNet, based on a neural network model, improving on previous work based on Support Vector Machines achieving 91% accuracy, on an out of sample dataset of high school and collegiate football head impacts. The integrated MiG2.0 and FITBIR system serve as a collaborative research tool to be disseminated across multiple institutions towards creating a standardized dataset for furthering the knowledge of concussion biomechanics.			arxiv	['Samuel J.

992	Deep Learning Head Model for Real-time Estimation of Entire Brain Deformation in Concussion	Xianghao Zhan	2020-10-16 17:37:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08527v2	Objective: Many recent studies have suggested that brain deformation resulting from a head impact is linked to the corresponding clinical outcome, such as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Even though several finite element (FE) head models have been developed and validated to calculate brain deformation based on impact kinematics, the clinical application of these FE head models is limited due to the time-consuming nature of FE simulations. This work aims to accelerate the process of brain deformation calculation and thus improve the potential for clinical applications. Methods: We propose a deep learning head model with a five-layer deep neural network and feature engineering, and trained and tested the model on 1803 total head impacts from a combination of head model simulations and on-field college football and mixed martial arts impacts. Results: The proposed deep learning head model can calculate the maximum principal strain for every element in the entire brain in less than 0.001s (with an average root mean squared error of 0.025, and with a standard deviation of 0.002 over twenty repeats with random data partition and model initialization). The contributions of various features to the predictive power of the model were investigated, and it was noted that the features based on angular acceleration were found to be more predictive than the features based on angular velocity. Conclusion: Trained using the dataset of 1803 head impacts, this model can be applied to various sports in the calculation of brain strain with accuracy, and its applicability can even further be extended by incorporating data from other types of head impacts. Significance: In addition to the potential clinical application in real-time brain deformation monitoring, this model will help researchers estimate the brain strain from a large number of head impacts more efficiently than using FE models.			arxiv	['Yuzhe Liu', 'Samuel J.

993	A comparison of sports-related head accelerations with and without direct head impacts	Samuel J. Raymond	2021-08-19 16:07:16	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08763v2	Concussion and repeated exposure to mild traumatic brain injury are risks for athletes in many sports. While direct head impacts are analyzed to improve the detection and awareness of head acceleration events so that an athlete's brain health can be appropriately monitored and treated. However, head accelerations can also be induced by impacts with little or no head involvement. In this work we evaluated if impacts that do not involve direct head contact, such as being pushed in the torso, can be sufficient in collegiate American football to induce head accelerations comparable to direct head impacts. Datasets of impacts with and without direct head contact were collected and compared. These datasets were gathered using a state-of-the-art impact detection algorithm embedded in an instrumented mouthguard to record head kinematics. Video analysis was used to differentiate between impact types. In total, 15 impacts of each type were used in comparison, with clear video screenshots available to distinguish each impact type. Analysis of the kinematics showed that the impacts without direct head contact achieved similar levels of linear and angular accelerations during impact compared to those from direct head impacts. Finite element analyses using the median and peak kinematic signals were used to calculate maximum principal strain of the brain. Statistical analysis revealed that no significant difference was found between the two datasets based on a Bonferroni-adjusted p-value threshold of 0.017 , with the exception of peak linear acceleration. Impacts without direct head contact showed higher mean values of peak linear acceleration values of 17.6 g compared to the direct-head impact mean value of 6.1g. These results indicated that impacts other than direct head impacts could still produce meaningful kinematic loads in the head and as such should be included in athlete health monitoring.			arxiv	['Yuzhe Liu', 'Nicholas J.

994	Rapidly and accurately estimating brain strain and strain rate across head impact types with transfer learning and data fusion	Xianghao Zhan	2021-08-31 01:45:20	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13577v1	Brain strain and strain rate are effective in predicting traumatic brain injury (TBI) caused by head impacts. However, state-of-the-art finite element modeling (FEM) demands considerable computational time in the computation, limiting its application in real-time TBI risk monitoring. To accelerate, machine learning head models (MLHMs) were developed, and the model accuracy was found to decrease when the training/test datasets were from different head impacts types. However, the size of dataset for specific impact types may not be enough for model training. To address the computational cost of FEM, the limited strain rate prediction, and the generalizability of MLHMs to on-field datasets, we propose data fusion and transfer learning to develop a series of MLHMs to predict the maximum principal strain (MPS) and maximum principal strain rate (MPSR). We trained and tested the MLHMs on 13,623 head impacts from simulations, American football, mixed martial arts, car crash, and compared against the models trained on only simulations or only on-field impacts. The MLHMs developed with transfer learning are significantly more accurate in estimating MPS and MPSR than other models, with a mean absolute error (MAE) smaller than 0.03 in predicting MPS and smaller than 7 (1/s) in predicting MPSR on all impact datasets. The MLHMs can be applied to various head impact types for rapidly and accurately calculating brain strain and strain rate. Besides the clinical applications in real-time brain strain and strain rate monitoring, this model helps researchers estimate the brain strain and strain rate caused by head impacts more efficiently than FEM.			arxiv	['Yuzhe Liu', 'Nicholas J.

995	A Distributed Algorithm for Overlapped Community Detection in Large-Scale Networks	Dibakar Saha	2020-11-11 18:18:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05954v1	Overlapped community detection in social networks has become an important research area with the increasing popularity and complexity of the networks. Most of the existing solutions are either centralized or parallel algorithms, which are computationally intensive - require complete knowledge of the entire networks. But it isn't easy to collect entire network data because the size of the actual networks may be prohibitively large. This may be a result of either privacy concerns or technological impediments. Performing in-network computation solves both problems utilizing the computational capability of the individual nodes of the network. Simultaneously, nodes communicate and share data with their neighbors via message passing, which may go a long way toward mitigating individual nodes' privacy concerns in the network. All the aforementioned concerns motivated us to design a decentralized or distributed technique to detect overlapped communities in a large-scale network. It is desirable because this technique does not offer a single point of failure, and the system as a whole can continue to function even when many of the nodes fail. In this paper, we address the overlapped community detection problem for large-scale networks. We present an efficient distributed algorithm, named DOCD, to identify the overlapped communities in the network. The DOCD algorithm's efficiency is verified with extensive simulation study on real network data such as Dolphin, Zachary karate club, Football club, and Facebook ego networks. We show that DOCD algorithm is capable of keeping the asymptotically same results with the existing classical centralized algorithms in terms of community modularity and the number of identified communities. The DOCD algorithm can also efficiently identify the overlapped nodes and overlapped communities with a small number of rounds of communication and computation.			arxiv	['Partha Sarathi Mandal']	463.0
996	Data-driven decomposition of brain dynamics with principal component analysis in different types of head impacts	Xianghao Zhan	2021-10-27 01:38:01	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14116v1	Strain and strain rate are effective traumatic brain injury predictors. Kinematics-based models estimating these metrics suffer from significant different distributions of both kinematics and the injury metrics across head impact types. To address this, previous studies focus on the kinematics but not the injury metrics. We have previously shown the kinematic features vary largely across head impact types, resulting in different patterns of brain deformation. This study analyzes the spatial distribution of brain deformation and applies principal component analysis (PCA) to extract the representative patterns of injury metrics (maximum principal strain (MPS), MPS rate (MPSR) and MPSXMPSR) in four impact types (simulation, football, mixed martial arts and car crashes). We apply PCA to decompose the patterns of the injury metrics for all impacts in each impact type, and investigate the distributions among brain regions using the first principal component (PC1). Furthermore, we developed a deep learning head model (DLHM) to predict PC1 and then inverse-transform to predict for all brain elements. PC1 explained >80% variance on the datasets. Based on PC1 coefficients, the corpus callosum and midbrain exhibit high variance on all datasets. We found MPSXMPSR the most sensitive metric on which the top 5% of severe impacts further deviates from the mean and there is a higher variance among the severe impacts. Finally, the DLHM reached mean absolute errors of <0.018 for MPS, <3.7 (1/s) for MPSR and <1.1 (1/s) for MPSXMPSR, much smaller than the injury thresholds. The brain injury metric in a dataset can be decomposed into mean components and PC1 with high explained variance. The brain dynamics decomposition enables better interpretation of the patterns in brain injury metrics and the sensitivity of brain injury metrics across impact types. The decomposition also reduces the dimensionality of DLHM.			arxiv	['Yuzhe Liu', 'Nicholas J. Cecchi', 'Olivier Gevaert', 'Michael M. Zeineh', 'Gerald A. Grant', 'David B. Camarillo']	464.0
997	Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is a Sequence Modeling Problem	Muning Wen	2022-05-30 09:39:45	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14953v3	Large sequence model (SM) such as GPT series and BERT has displayed outstanding performance and generalization capabilities on vision, language, and recently reinforcement learning tasks. A natural follow-up question is how to abstract multi-agent decision making into an SM problem and benefit from the prosperous development of SMs. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture named Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) that effectively casts cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) into SM problems wherein the task is to map agents' observation sequence to agents' optimal action sequence. Our goal is to build the bridge between MARL and SMs so that the modeling power of modern sequence models can be unleashed for MARL. Central to our MAT is an encoder-decoder architecture which leverages the multi-agent advantage decomposition theorem to transform the joint policy search problem into a sequential decision making process; this renders only linear time complexity for multi-agent problems and, most importantly, endows MAT with monotonic performance improvement guarantee. Unlike prior arts such as Decision Transformer fit only pre-collected offline data, MAT is trained by online trials and errors from the environment in an on-policy fashion. To validate MAT, we conduct extensive experiments on StarCraftII, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, Dexterous Hands Manipulation, and Google Research Football benchmarks. Results demonstrate that MAT achieves superior performance and data efficiency compared to strong baselines including MAPPO and HAPPO. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MAT is an excellent few-short learner on unseen tasks regardless of changes in the number of agents.

998	Padded Helmet Shell Covers in American Football: A Comprehensive Laboratory Evaluation with Preliminary On-Field Findings	Nicholas J. Cecchi	2022-11-27 19:38:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14921v1	Protective headgear effects measured in the laboratory may not always translate to the field. In this study, we evaluated the impact attenuation capabilities of a commercially available padded helmet shell cover in the laboratory and field. In the laboratory, we evaluated the efficacy of the padded helmet shell cover in attenuating impact magnitude across six impact locations and three impact velocities when equipped to three different helmet models. In a preliminary on-field investigation, we used instrumented mouthguards to monitor head impact magnitude in collegiate linebackers during practice sessions while not wearing the padded helmet shell covers (i.e., bare helmets) for one season and whilst wearing the padded helmet shell covers for another season. The addition of the padded helmet shell cover was effective in attenuating the magnitude of angular head accelerations and two brain injury risk metrics (DAMAGE, HARM) across most laboratory impact conditions, but did not significantly attenuate linear head accelerations for all helmets. Overall, HARM values were reduced in laboratory impact tests by an average of 25% at 3.5 m/s (range: 9.7 - 39.6%), 18% at 5.5 m/s (range: -5.5 - 40.5%), and 10% at 7.4 m/s (range: -6.0 - 31.0%). However, on the field, no significant differences in any measure of head impact magnitude were observed between the bare helmet impacts and padded helmet impacts. Further laboratory tests were conducted to evaluate the ability of the padded helmet shell cover to maintain its performance after exposure to repeated, successive impacts and across a range of temperatures. This research provides a detailed assessment of padded helmet shell covers and supports the continuation of in vivo helmet research to validate laboratory testing results.			arxiv	['Ashlyn A.

999	The MuSe 2023 Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge: Mimicked Emotions, Cross-Cultural Humour, and Personalisation	Lukas Christ	2023-05-05 08:53:57	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03369v1	The MuSe 2023 is a set of shared tasks addressing three different contemporary multimodal affect and sentiment analysis problems: In the Mimicked Emotions Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Mimic), participants predict three continuous emotion targets. This sub-challenge utilises the Hume-Vidmimic dataset comprising of user-generated videos. For the Cross-Cultural Humour Detection Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Humour), an extension of the Passau Spontaneous Football Coach Humour (Passau-SFCH) dataset is provided. Participants predict the presence of spontaneous humour in a cross-cultural setting. The Personalisation Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Personalisation) is based on the Ulm-Trier Social Stress Test (Ulm-TSST) dataset, featuring recordings of subjects in a stressed situation. Here, arousal and valence signals are to be predicted, whereas parts of the test labels are made available in order to facilitate personalisation. MuSe 2023 seeks to bring together a broad audience from different research communities such as audio-visual emotion recognition, natural language processing, signal processing, and health informatics. In this baseline paper, we introduce the datasets, sub-challenges, and provided feature sets. As a competitive baseline system, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is employed. On the respective sub-challenges' test datasets, it achieves a mean (across three continuous intensity targets) Pearson's Correlation Coefficient of .4727 for MuSe-Mimic, an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of .8310 for MuSe-Humor and Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) values of .7482 for arousal and .7827 for valence in the MuSe-Personalisation sub-challenge.			arxiv	['Shahin Amiriparian', 'Alice Baird', 'Alexander Kathan', 'Niklas Müller', 'Steffen Klug', 'Chris Gagne', 'Panagiotis Tzirakis', 'Eva-Maria Meßner', 'Andreas König', 'Alan Cowen', 'Erik Cambria', 'Björn W.
