I never actually got to see them play regularly so I wouldn’t know. They seemed to be so creative and different to what I watch day to day. What do you guys think?	25.0	t3_19023le	reddit		
4	Is there any way for smaller clubs to ever have a chance to truly compete in world football?	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-06 14:44:47	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1901gwb/is_there_any_way_for_smaller_clubs_to_ever_have_a/	I’ll use top 5 for example, we all know the top leagues are dominated as the following: Premier League- Big 6 La Liga- 2 teams and once in a while 3 teams Serie A- Big 6 like Prem Bundesliga- 1 team Ligue 1- 1 team That’s why I think it’d be good for clubs like Girona, Aston Villa, and Bayer Leverkusen to win there leagues as it changes the usual and predictable norm of the same teams winning their league. This could as set a precedent for football as a whole to become more competitive in the future. FFP has been absolutely AWFUL and I think a salary cap wouldn’t work as that would hinder smaller clubs due due the cap in spending. Would a luxury tax work? You break FFP or if you have a salary cap and go over the cap you pay back the league and the league redistributes the money to the rest of the clubs in the league. What do you guys think will smaller clubs ever consistently compete with bigger clubs in their leagues, in the UCL, and in world football as a whole?	13.0	t3_1901gwb	reddit

8	It really annoys me that every Best XI voted by FIFA or UEFA (or any other federation) always have players in the wrong positions and doesn't abide by current football meta	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-05 09:46:20	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18z36xk/it_really_annoys_me_that_every_best_xi_voted_by/	These TOTY or TOTS XIs usually have 4 strikers, 3 attacking midfielders and 3 defenders (1 of them is a wingback). This is kind of disrespectful to defenders and defensive midfielders. They even have some players in the wrong position. Look up IFFHS Men's World Team 2023, they play Harry Kane as RW, Messi as LM and Alphonso Davies as CB. If these Best XIs played in French Ligue 2, they wouldn't be able to promote to Ligue 1.	6.0	t3_18z36xk	reddit

18	Here's why I think Kylian Mbappe should move to Liverpool and its the only correct move for competitive balance in world football.	:Soccer_ball:	2024-01-06 08:32:26	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18zvhji/heres_why_i_think_kylian_mbappe_should_move_to/	Here's why I think Mbappe should move to Liverpool and its the only correct move for competitive balance in world football: 1. Bayern will never sanction a move for him, and I don't think Mbappe wants to go from one horse league to another. 2. Barca are broke, Atletico are not prestigious enough. 3. Serie A clubs like Juve, Inter, Milan also do not posses the financial muscle to afford him. 4. That leaves the PL clubs, among which United/Chelsea are too shit for him to consider, City has his rival Haaland playing, Arsenal has FFP issues, Spurs/Newcastle are not gonna entice him and that leaves only Liverpool! So its either moving to Madrid, staying at PSG or coming to Liverpool: 1. Scenario - stays at PSG: He's reaching the ceiling of his potential to grow in Ligue 1 away from worldwide attention and he needs to move in order to evolve as well as start increasing his legacy as a player if he truly wants to contend for one of the greatest players of all-time. 2. Scenario - comes to Liverpool: He will play in the most popular league in the world, with his rival Haaland against him for another title winning side of Man City, its the perfect blockbuster. --- Now comes the nightmare final scenario - Goes to Real Madrid: This is the last straw that will break things apart. If he goes there, then there is no side stopping Madrid to completely decimate the Europe for a decade to come. Real Madrid will have these players under their disposal if things go according to plan: - Mbappe (25) - Vini (23) - Rodrygo (23) - Endrick (17) - Bellingham (20) - Guler (18) - Valverde (25) - Tchouameni (23) - Camavinga (20) - Militao (25) - Davies (23) ? - Yoro (18) ? How is anyone in their wildest dream can compete against this monster team that will all come in their prime together while gelling on chemistry for decade to come? It will ruin the Champions League forever to Mercedes F1 levels. Mbappe, has to come to Liverpool.	30.0	t3_18zvhji	reddit

He was rapid, could stop and start on a dime, accelerated from a stop almost faster than anyone else I've seen, press resistant, great ball striking, good range of passing, high work rate but unfortunately he was just horrible at decision making and had mediocre in game intelligence. In his prime at chelsea he constantly constantly messed up counter attacks, had a very poor sense of positioning and making off ball runs, and despite being good at ball striking and having a great passing range lacked the vision to be a consistent creative outlet. This is one of the reasons why fans of other teams think he used to be great and chelsea fans used to not like him as much.

75	Eric Dier - what next for him?	Unknown	2023-12-29 16:06:37	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18tqirh/eric_dier_what_next_for_him/	As the title suggests. I wondered where people thought he may go next really. Thinking about what he offers - pretty much can only play in the centre of a three or possibly defensive midfield, which maybe means Italy or lower half prem teams, but none really play a back 3 in the prem atm. In terms of what he offers, you get a player with great leadership, really nice distribution short or long. Aerial ability perfectly decent but not a strong one on one tackler. On the downside I'm not sure how press resistant he is, he's slow which will be an issue to any team attempting a high line, and if he were to be moved into midfield it's a long time since he's played there so very much an unproven quantity. Can he do the stones style role of playing in a 4 and tucking in as part of a double pivot in possession? I'm not sure what his potential is picking up the ball on the half turn, and equally not sure he can still be a decent 6. I'm interested to know people's thoughts. I think he's got a lot of talent but maybe not specific traits that suit the modern game? The only top side in the prem playing a low block counter attack style that would suit him are united, and that would be a hugely long shot move. I'd be intrigued to know if he could play as a single pivot in a 433 but it's a long shot. What does everyone think?	1.0	t3_18tqirh	reddit

The amount of Multi-Club groups has grown at an accelerated pace the last few years, yet none of them seem to have some real differentiators apart from their ownership structure. Take City Football Group for example. Sure, they may have some of the current top Clubs around the world, like Manchester City and Girona, but the only real differentiator from other groups seems to be that they are owned by Abu Dhabi. My question is, do you think that there are any real differentiators to these groups? Is there any of them that actually justifies their existence by having something in their methodology that is doing things differently? What could potentially be a unique selling proposition from any of these groups, apart of the money that they offer to their previous owners?

86	Why don't we have a ratio of individual goals scored/team goals scored	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-27 12:43:28	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18rzvgu/why_dont_we_have_a_ratio_of_individual_goals/	"When we have discussion about players we always have raw stats (total of goals, assists and at best goals/assists per game, but i think it will be better to have goals/assists per minutes played) but we never have a ratio vs team goals scored. Some players really benefits from their teams style of play (Haaland for Man City for instance) but others don't (Hazard during his Chelsea time with a very defensive side). With expected goals/assists it kind of balance this problem but does not account for other factors. Example, if you play with Salah at Liverpool you know you will have more space because defenders will focus on him, even if they are far, they will keep an eye on him. Another exemple, if you play with very aggressive and technical players, you will have more penalties given to you and it increases your goals scored amount. So a bit of a controversial take to finish but if we take Messi and Ronaldo, I think that they had massively benefit, in terms of stats, from their superteam goal scoring machine but we never take that into account. Messi for Argentina : 0,58 goals per game VS Messi for Barcelona : 0,86 goals Ronaldo for Portugal : 0,62 goals per game Vs Ronaldo for Real Madrid : 1,03 goals per game Vs Ronaldo for Juventus : 0,75 goals per game Hazard for Chelsea : 0,31 goal per game (but to be fair he has also 0,26 assists per game) Torres for a defensive Liverpool Benitez side : 0,57 goals per game (just needed another exemple) We can see that it makes a huge difference, if we can have a ratio it will balance things out and helps us make better comparaison, some players stats are really helped by their teams offensive tactic, the players they play with, where they play (it is easier to score in Bundesliga), etc. I hope one day that we will have more context on stats in football, it really feels ""cheap"" and ""childish"" sometimes."	3.0	t3_18rzvgu	reddit		
87	Do you think City is trying to do what Madrid did with Brazilian wonder-kids to Argentinians?	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-27 03:20:24	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18rqf8p/do_you_think_city_is_trying_to_do_what_madrid_did/	Real Madrid’s recent transfer policy centers around young Brazilians. Vinicius Junior in 2018, Rodrygo in 2019, Eder Militao in 2019. Renier Jesus in 2020. And Endrick in 2022. The get all of these players before they become established stars and some like Vini and Rodrygo before Europe even. And the seeds gave fruit. Vini is now the world’s best winger and only cost €45 million. Rodrygo is a prolific and performing right winger and only cost €40 million. Eder Militao is a top 5 world center back and only cost like €50 million. Renier Jesus flopped hard and Endrick is yet to prove himself, but these investments have shown to have lots of worth. They were big factors in guiding Madrid to another UCL. Brazil + Real Madrid is becoming a brand. Is Man City trying this with Argentines? They signed Alvarez last year and he’s been performing brilliantly for them, he’s very similar to Rodrygo. They signed Perrone who is developing and have now signed Everechhi a highly talented wonder kid from Boca. They are also thinking of signing Barco. Do you guys think Man City is trying to build a reputation in a Football hotbed like Argentina (like how Real Madrid did in Brazil?) after all Alvarez said that it was the positive history of Argentines in man city like aguero and Zabaletta that lead him to choose them. What do you guys think? Man City and Real Madrid are the 2 best clubs in the world right now, and seem to have the market for 2 of footballs’s greatest hotbeds in the continent of South America.

The minute of silence for the death of the greatest football player of all time, in an empty stadium really gave me this feeling of ""it's over"". Since COVID I feel like most iconic clubs have recessed into stagnation and lost much of their historical glory, apart from Real Madrid. Juventus, Milan, Barcelona, Man United, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Liverpool, for god's sake even Paris Saint Germain, all of them have been falling and falling, losing players, appeal, tradition, fans. The Messi and Ronaldo's era was quite long, and probably destroyed many other players in the meanwhile, but they were part of a larger design, they played against and with the likes of Nesta, Maldini, Scholes, Keane, Giggs, Ronaldinho, Cannavaro, Del Piero, Totti, Buffon and so on, leaving a permanent mark. The class of 90s has been quite disappointing and no one has really replaced the old legends, leaving a generational void. The super league, the downward spiral of certain domestic championships, the diminishing importance of the Champions League and the increase of black swans events like multiple balloon d'ors winners, repeted consecutive champions league winners, legends leaving their historical clubs or joining rivals or playing in Arabia for money, no players actually caring about glory, alongside the disillusion and diminishing cultural importance of the sport (younger generations care more about Fortnite thsn football) and the lack of personality by football figures have destroyed the beauty of this game.

92	Rodri is not as good as people claim he is	:Soccer_ball:	2023-12-28 10:36:48	https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18sqzu3/rodri_is_not_as_good_as_people_claim_he_is/	Before y'all down vote and comment to tell me I'm the dumbest mfer alive, hear me out. Rodri is undeniably a world class player. His ability to retain the ball is amazing. He can cope with being left all alone in midfield... Against weaker teams. Which is impressive, don't get me wrong. You can't expect a midfielder to hold the entire midfield of a top team alone. But here is my first problem with what people claim of Rodri. People pretend that Rodri single handedly bosses the midfield against top teams. And sure, he might have 1 game once in a while where he does that. Great players have great moments. But that does *not* mean he is capable of regularly doing that. In my opinion, no one is capable of regularly bossing a midfield around by themselves. Yet, mostly city fans to be fair, have been claiming this for a while and I'm getting quite tired of seeing it. No, Rodri vs the entire Arsenal midfield isn't going to win. He's not THAT good. My second complaint about what people say about Rodri is that he's better than Haaland or De Bruyne because City can win without either of them, but not without Rodri. And I'm sorry, but that's a non sequitur argument. A non sequitur argument is an argument where the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. Rodri being more important to that City team is the logical conclusion. Now you can argue that him being more important makes him better, but that I would disagree with also. I think Rodri is more important because of Pep's system requiring a DM, but they only have Rodri. Let me elaborate on that before you try to call me stupid though. Who do Manchester City have when Grealish is out? Doku and Foden. Who do City have when Haaland is out? Alvarez, potentially the third best striker in the world. Who do they have when Bernardo Silva is out? Again, Foden can play that position. Who do City have when Nunes or Kovacic are out? They have Rico Lewis. Who do Manchester City have to control the attack? When he's not injured, De Bruyne. Arguably the best creative midfielder in the world right now. Now don't get me wrong, not all players I have named are worldclass. But you would all agree with me if I said they are good enough at what they do to fall in, right? But who do City have as back up for Rodri? Philips... Kelvin Philips. So I really, truly, must beg the question whether Rodri is as important to City as he is because he's on level with Lothar Matthaus (I've seen some idiot actually claim this) or if it's because City have no back up DM. In my opinion, it's the latter. Again, Rodri is worldclass, but he's NOT the best player in the world. And no, him being more important for City than Haaland, when City have the third best striker in the world coming off the bench, is not a great argument for why he's *better*.	37.0	t3_18sqzu3	reddit

101	Network analysis of the worldwide footballer transfer market	Ming-Xia Li	2018-11-01 10:16:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00300v1	The transfer of football players is an important part in football games. Most studies on the transfer of football players focus on the transfer system and transfer fees but not on the transfer behavior itself. Based on the 470,792 transfer records from 1990 to 2016 among 23,605 football clubs in 206 countries and regions, we construct a directed footballer transfer network (FTN), where the nodes are the football clubs and the links correspond to the footballer transfers. A systemic analysis is conduced on the topological properties of the FTN. We find that the in-degrees, out-degrees, in-strengths and out-strengths of nodes follow bimodal distributions (a power law with exponential decay), while the distribution of link weights has a power-law tail. We further figure out the correlations between node degrees, node strengths and link weights. We also investigate the general characteristics of different measures of network centrality. Our network analysis of the global footballer transfer market sheds new lights into the investigation of the characteristics of transfer activities.			arxiv	['Wei-Xing Zhou', 'H. Eugene Stanley']	1.0
102	Networks of international football: communities, evolution and globalization of the game	Yang Li	2022-05-21 13:43:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10599v1	As the most popular sport around the globe, the game of football has recently intrigued much research interest to explore and distill useful and appealing information from the sport. Network science and graph-centric methods have been previously applied to study the importance of football players and teams. In this paper, for the first time we study the macroscopic evolution of the football society from a complex network point of view. Football game records within a time window of over a century were collected and expressed in a graph format, where participant teams are represented by graph nodes and the games between them are the graph edges. We carry out community detection and temporal analysis to reveal the dynamic features and the community structures embedded within the football network, offering the evidence of a continuously expanding football society. Spatio-temporal analysis is also implemented to unveil the temporal states that represent distinct development stages in the football history. Our analysis suggests that the evolution of the game receives considerable impact not only from major sport events, but also from multiple social and political incidents. The game of football and its evolution reflect significant historical transitions and turning points, and can provide a novel perspective for the study of the worldwide globalization process.			arxiv	['Gonzalo Mateos']	2.0
103	The classification of football patterns	V. Braungart	2006-06-08 16:14:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606193v1	We prove that every spherical football (also known as a spherical soccer ball) is a branched cover, branched only in the vertices, of the standard football made up of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. We also give examples showing that the corresponding result is not true for footballs of higher genera. Moreover, we classify the possible pairs (k,l) for which football patterns on the sphere exist satisfying a natural generalisation of the usual incidence relation between pentagons and hexagons to k-gons and l-gons.			arxiv	['D.

In this note we completely describe the degenerations of these footballs as one or both of the cone angles approaches zero. In particular, we show that Hamilton's famous non-compact cigar soliton is the Gromov--Hausdorff limit of Hamilton's compact conical teardrop solitons.			arxiv	['Kewei Zhang']	5.0
105	Seasonal Linear Predictivity in National Football Championships	Giuseppe Jurman	2015-11-19 17:14:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06262v1	Predicting the results of sport matches and competitions is an arising research field, benefiting from the growing amount of available data and the novel data analytics techniques. Excellent forecasts can be achieved by advanced machine learning methods applied to detailed historical data, especially in very popular sports such as football (soccer). Here we show that, despite the large number of confounding factors, the results of a football team in longer competitions (e.g., a national league) follow a basically linear trend useful for predictive purposes, too. In support of this claim, we present a set of experiments of linear regression on a database collecting the yearly results of 707 teams playing in 22 divisions from 11 countries, in 20 football seasons.			arxiv	[]	6.0
106	Pricing Football Players using Neural Networks	Sourya Dey	2017-11-16 00:14:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05865v2	We designed a multilayer perceptron neural network to predict the price of a football (soccer) player using data on more than 15,000 players from the football simulation video game FIFA 2017. The network was optimized by experimenting with different activation functions, number of neurons and layers, learning rate and its decay, Nesterov momentum based stochastic gradient descent, L2 regularization, and early stopping. Simultaneous exploration of various aspects of neural network training is performed and their trade-offs are investigated. Our final model achieves a top-5 accuracy of 87.2% among 119 pricing categories, and places any footballer within 6.32% of his actual price on average.			arxiv	[]	7.0
107	Predictive modelling of football injuries	Stylianos Kampakis	2016-09-20 11:58:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07480v1	The goal of this thesis is to investigate the potential of predictive modelling for football injuries. This work was conducted in close collaboration with Tottenham Hotspurs FC (THFC), the PGA European tour and the participation of Wolverhampton Wanderers (WW). Three investigations were conducted: 1. Predicting the recovery time of football injuries using the UEFA injury recordings: The UEFA recordings is a common standard for recording injuries in professional football. For this investigation, three datasets of UEFA injury recordings were available. Different machine learning algorithms were used in order to build a predictive model. The performance of the machine learning models is then improved by using feature selection conducted through correlation-based subset feature selection and random forests. 2. Predicting injuries in professional football using exposure records: The relationship between exposure (in training hours and match hours) in professional football athletes and injury incidence was studied. A common problem in football is understanding how the training schedule of an athlete can affect the chance of him getting injured. The task was to predict the number of days a player can train before he gets injured. 3. Predicting intrinsic injury incidence using in-training GPS measurements: A significant percentage of football injuries can be attributed to overtraining and fatigue. GPS data collected during training sessions might provide indicators of fatigue, or might be used to detect very intense training sessions which can lead to overtraining. This research used GPS data gathered during training sessions of the first team of THFC, in order to predict whether an injury would take place during a week.			arxiv	[]	8.0
108	Explaining the difference between men's and women's football	Luca Pappalardo	2021-01-05 17:25:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01662v1	Women's football is gaining supporters and practitioners worldwide, raising questions about what the differences are with men's football. While the two sports are often compared based on the players' physical attributes, we analyze the spatio-temporal events during matches in the last World Cups to compare male and female teams based on their technical performance. We train an artificial intelligence model to recognize if a team is male or female based on variables that describe a match's playing intensity, accuracy, and performance quality. Our model accurately distinguishes between men's and women's football, revealing crucial technical differences, which we investigate through the extraction of explanations from the classifier's decisions. The differences between men's and women's football are rooted in play accuracy, the recovery time of ball possession, and the players' performance quality. Our methodology may help journalists and fans understand what makes women's football a distinct sport and coaches design tactics tailored to female teams.			arxiv	['Alessio Rossi', 'Giuseppe Pontillo', 'Michela Natilli', 'Paolo Cintia']	9.0
109	How does AI play football? An analysis of RL and real-world football strategies	Atom Scott	2021-11-24 08:44:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12340v1	Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have made it possible to develop sophisticated agents that excel in a wide range of applications. Simulations using such agents can provide valuable information in scenarios that are difficult to scientifically experiment in the real world. In this paper, we examine the play-style characteristics of football RL agents and uncover how strategies may develop during training. The learnt strategies are then compared with those of real football players. We explore what can be learnt from the use of simulated environments by using aggregated statistics and social network analysis (SNA). As a result, we found that (1) there are strong correlations between the competitiveness of an agent and various SNA metrics and (2) aspects of the RL agents play style become similar to real world footballers as the agent becomes more competitive. We discuss further advances that may be necessary to improve our understanding necessary to fully utilise RL for the analysis of football.			arxiv	['Keisuke Fujii', 'Masaki Onishi']	10.0
110	Transformer-Based Neural Marked Spatio Temporal Point Process Model for Football Match Events Analysis	Calvin C. K. Yeung	2023-02-18 10:02:45	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09276v1	With recently available football match event data that record the details of football matches, analysts and researchers have a great opportunity to develop new performance metrics, gain insight, and evaluate key performance. However, most sports sequential events modeling methods and performance metrics approaches could be incomprehensive in dealing with such large-scale spatiotemporal data (in particular, temporal process), thereby necessitating a more comprehensive spatiotemporal model and a holistic performance metric. To this end, we proposed the Transformer-Based Neural Marked Spatio Temporal Point Process (NMSTPP) model for football event data based on the neural temporal point processes (NTPP) framework. In the experiments, our model outperformed the prediction performance of the baseline models. Furthermore, we proposed the holistic possession utilization score (HPUS) metric for a more comprehensive football possession analysis. For verification, we examined the relationship with football teams' final ranking, average goal score, and average xG over a season. It was observed that the average HPUS showed significant correlations regardless of not using goal and details of shot information. Furthermore, we show HPUS examples in analyzing possessions, matches, and between matches.			arxiv	['Tony Sit', 'Keisuke Fujii']	11.0
111	Machine Learning Modeling to Evaluate the Value of Football Players	Chenyao Li	2022-07-22 22:34:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11361v1	In most sports, especially football, most coaches and analysts search for key performance indicators using notational analysis. This method utilizes a statistical summary of events based on video footage and numerical records of goal scores. Unfortunately, this approach is now obsolete owing to the continuous evolutionary increase in technology that simplifies the analysis of more complex process variables through machine learning (ML). Machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), uses algorithms to detect meaningful patterns and define a structure based on positional data. This research investigates a new method to evaluate the value of current football players, based on establishing the machine learning models to investigate the relations among the various features of players, the salary of players, and the market value of players. The data of the football players used for this project is from several football websites. The data on the salary of football players will be the proxy for evaluating the value of players, and other features will be used to establish and train the ML model for predicting the suitable salary for the players. The motivation is to explore what are the relations between different features of football players and their salaries - how each feature affects their salaries, or which are the most important features to affect the salary? Although many standards can reflect the value of football players, the salary of the players is one of the most intuitive and crucial indexes, so this study will use the salary of players as the proxy to evaluate their value. Moreover, many features of players can affect the valuation of the football players, but the value of players is mainly decided by three types of factors: basic characteristics, performance on the court, and achievements at the club.			arxiv	['Stylianos Kampakis', 'Philip Treleaven']	12.0
112	On the flight of an American Football	Curtis Horn	2007-06-04 18:34:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0366v1	In this paper we examine the detailed theory of the American football in flight, with spin and air resistance included. We find the theory has much in common with the theory of a gyroscope and also rocket trajectory with a misaligned thruster. Unfortunately most of the air resistance data, for rocketry and ballistics, is for speeds of Mach 1 or higher, where the air resistance increases dramatically. We shall approximate a realistic air resistance, at the slower speeds of football flight, with a drag force proportional to cross sectional area and either $v$ or $v^2$, depending on speed, where $v$ is velocity of the football. We begin with a discussion of the motion, giving as much detail as possible without the use of complex analytic calculations. We point out the previous errors made with moments of inertia and make the necessary corrections for more accurate results. We show that the shape of an American football closely resembles a parabola of revolution.			arxiv	['Heidi Fearn']	13.0
113	Using Twitter to predict football outcomes	Stylianos Kampakis	2014-11-05 11:50:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1243v1	Twitter has been proven to be a notable source for predictive modelling on various domains such as the stock market, the dissemination of diseases or sports outcomes. However, such a study has not been conducted in football (soccer) so far. The purpose of this research was to study whether data mined from Twitter can be used for this purpose. We built a set of predictive models for the outcome of football games of the English Premier League for a 3 month period based on tweets and we studied whether these models can overcome predictive models which use only historical data and simple football statistics. Moreover, combined models are constructed using both Twitter and historical data. The final results indicate that data mined from Twitter can indeed be a useful source for predicting games in the Premier League. The final Twitter-based model performs significantly better than chance when measured by Cohen's kappa and is comparable to the model that uses simple statistics and historical data. Combining both models raises the performance higher than it was achieved by each individual model. Thereby, this study provides evidence that Twitter derived features can indeed provide useful information for the prediction of football (soccer) outcomes.			arxiv	['Andreas Adamides']	14.0

We introduce the Google Research Football Environment, a new reinforcement learning environment where agents are trained to play football in an advanced, physics-based 3D simulator. The resulting environment is challenging, easy to use and customize, and it is available under a permissive open-source license. In addition, it provides support for multiplayer and multi-agent experiments. We propose three full-game scenarios of varying difficulty with the Football Benchmarks and report baseline results for three commonly used reinforcement algorithms (IMPALA, PPO, and Ape-X DQN). We also provide a diverse set of simpler scenarios with the Football Academy and showcase several promising research directions.			arxiv	['Anton Raichuk', 'Piotr Stańczyk', 'Michał Zając', 'Olivier Bachem', 'Lasse Espeholt', 'Carlos Riquelme', 'Damien Vincent', 'Marcin Michalski', 'Olivier Bousquet', 'Sylvain Gelly']	15.0
115	A mathematical take on the competitive balance of a football league	Soudeep Deb	2021-02-18 12:06:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09288v1	Competitive balance in a football league is extremely important from the perspective of economic growth of the industry. Many researchers have earlier proposed different measures of competitive balance, which are primarily adapted from the standard economic theory. However, these measures fail to capture the finer nuances of the game. In this work, we discuss a new framework which is more suitable for a football league. First, we present a mathematical proof of an ideal situation where a football league becomes perfectly balanced. Next, a goal based index for competitive balance is developed. We present relevant theoretical results and show how the proposed index can be used to formally test for the presence of imbalance. The methods are implemented on the data from top five European leagues, and it shows that the new approach can better explain the changes in the seasonal competitive balance of the leagues. Further, using appropriate panel data models, we show that the proposed index is more suitable to analyze the variability in total revenues of the football leagues.			arxiv	[]	16.0
116	Stochastic model for football's collective dynamics	A. Chacoma	2021-04-20 22:30:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10272v2	In this paper, we study collective interaction dynamics emerging in the game of football-soccer. To do so, we surveyed a database containing body-sensors traces measured during three professional football matches, where we observed statistical patterns that we used to propose a stochastic model for the players' motion in the field. The model, which is based on linear interactions, captures in good approximation the spatiotemporal dynamics of a football team. Our theoretical framework, therefore, becomes an effective analytical tool to uncover the underlying cooperative mechanisms behind the complexity of football plays. Moreover, we showed that it can provide handy theoretical support for coaches to evaluate teams' and players' performances in both training sessions and competitive scenarios.			arxiv	['N.

Ashburn	2006-07-07 03:42:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0607064v2	We introduce a Bayesian mean-value approach for ranking all college football teams using only win-loss data. This approach is unique in that the prior distribution necessary to handle undefeated and winless teams is calculated self-consistently. Furthermore, we will show statistics supporting the validity of the prior distribution. Finally, a brief comparison with other football rankings will be presented.			arxiv	['Paul M. Colvert']	18.0
118	Statistics of football dynamics	R. S. Mendes	2007-06-12 18:26:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1758v1	We investigate the dynamics of football matches. Our goal is to characterize statistically the temporal sequence of ball movements in this collective sport game, searching for traits of complex behavior. Data were collected over a variety of matches in South American, European and World championships throughout 2005 and 2006. We show that the statistics of ball touches presents power-law tails and can be described by $q$-gamma distributions. To explain such behavior we propose a model that provides information on the characteristics of football dynamics. Furthermore, we discuss the statistics of duration of out-of-play intervals, not directly related to the previous scenario.			arxiv	['L. C. Malacarne', 'C. Anteneodo']	19.0
119	Combining historical data and bookmakers'odds in modelling football scores	Leonardo Egidi	2018-02-24 14:00:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08848v1	Modelling football outcomes has gained increasing attention, in large part due to the potential for making substantial profits. Despite the strong connection existing between football models and the bookmakers' betting odds, no authors have used the latter for improving the fit and the predictive accuracy of these models. We have developed a hierarchical Bayesian Poisson model in which the scoring rates of the teams are convex combinations of parameters estimated from historical data and the additional source of the betting odds. We apply our analysis to a nine-year dataset of the most popular European leagues in order to predict match outcomes for their tenth seasons. In this paper, we provide numerical and graphical checks for our model.			arxiv	['Francesco Pauli', 'Nicola Torelli']	20.0
120	Distinguishing Between Roles of Football Players in Play-by-play Match Event Data	Bart Aalbers	2018-09-13 20:43:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05173v1	Over the last few decades, the player recruitment process in professional football has evolved into a multi-billion industry and has thus become of vital importance. To gain insights into the general level of their candidate reinforcements, many professional football clubs have access to extensive video footage and advanced statistics. However, the question whether a given player would fit the team's playing style often still remains unanswered. In this paper, we aim to bridge that gap by proposing a set of 21 player roles and introducing a method for automatically identifying the most applicable roles for each player from play-by-play event data collected during matches.			arxiv	['Jan Van Haaren']	21.0

Diniz	2017-05-11 19:18:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04356v1	We propose two Bayesian multinomial-Dirichlet models to predict the final outcome of football (soccer) matches and compare them to three well-known models regarding their predictive power. All the models predicted the full-time results of 1710 matches of the first division of the Brazilian football championship and the comparison used three proper scoring rules, the proportion of errors and a calibration assessment. We also provide a goodness of fit measure. Our results show that multinomial-Dirichlet models are not only competitive with standard approaches, but they are also well calibrated and present reasonable goodness of fit.			arxiv	['Rafael Izbicki', 'Danilo Lopes', 'Luis Ernesto Salasar']	22.0

[9, 10] establish Bayesian methods for estimating home-team in-game win probability for college and NBA basketball. This paper introduces a Bayesian approach for estimating in-game home-team win probability for Division-I FBS college (American) football that uses expected number of remaining possessions and expected score as two predictors. Models for estimating these are presented and compared. These, along with other predictors are introduced into two Bayesian approaches for the final estimate of in-game home-team win probability. To illustrate utility, methods are applied to the 2021 Big XII Conference Football Championship game between Baylor and Oklahoma State.			arxiv	['Ryan Sides', 'Jane L. Harvill']	23.0

We show that this is a special case of a multiplicative model known as the Sarmanov family. Based on this family, we create more suitable models by moving probabilities between scores and employing other discrete distributions. We apply the new models to women's football scores, which exhibit some characteristics different than that of men's football.			arxiv	['Marius Ötting', 'Dimitris Karlis']	25.0
125	nflWAR: A Reproducible Method for Offensive Player Evaluation in Football	Ronald Yurko	2018-02-03 17:06:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00998v2	Unlike other major professional sports, American football lacks comprehensive statistical ratings for player evaluation that are both reproducible and easily interpretable in terms of game outcomes. Existing methods for player evaluation in football depend heavily on proprietary data, are not reproducible, and lag behind those of other major sports. We present four contributions to the study of football statistics in order to address these issues. First, we develop the R package nflscrapR to provide easy access to publicly available play-by-play data from the National Football League (NFL) dating back to 2009. Second, we introduce a novel multinomial logistic regression approach for estimating the expected points for each play. Third, we use the expected points as input into a generalized additive model for estimating the win probability for each play. Fourth, we introduce our nflWAR framework, using multilevel models to isolate the contributions of individual offensive skill players, and providing estimates for their individual wins above replacement (WAR). We estimate the uncertainty in each player's WAR through a resampling approach specifically designed for football, and we present these results for the 2017 NFL season. We discuss how our reproducible WAR framework, built entirely on publicly available data, can be easily extended to estimate WAR for players at any position, provided that researchers have access to data specifying which players are on the field during each play. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this work for NFL teams.			arxiv	['Samuel Ventura', 'Maksim Horowitz']	26.0
126	Protocol for an Observational Study of the Association of High School Football Participation on Health in Late Adulthood	Timothy G. Gaulton	2019-02-26 18:33:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10106v1	American football is the most popular high school sport and is among the leading cause of injury among adolescents. While there has been considerable recent attention on the link between football and cognitive decline, there is also evidence of higher than expected rates of pain, obesity, and lower quality of life among former professional players, either as a result of repetitive head injury or through different mechanisms. Previously hidden downstream effects of playing football may have far-reaching public health implications for participants in youth and high school football programs. Our proposed study is a retrospective observational study that compares 1,153 high school males who played varsity football with 2,751 male students who did not. 1,951 of the control subjects did not play any sport and the remaining 800 controls played a non-contact sport. Our primary outcome is self-rated health measured at age 65. To control for potential confounders, we adjust for pre-exposure covariates with matching and model-based covariance adjustment. We will conduct an ordered testing procedure designed to use the full pool of 2,751 controls while also controlling for possible unmeasured differences between students who played sports and those who did not. We will quantitatively assess the sensitivity of the results to potential unmeasured confounding. The study will also assess secondary outcomes of pain, difficulty with activities of daily living, and obesity, as these are both important to individual well-being and have public health relevance.			arxiv	['Sameer K.

127	FootApp: an AI-Powered System for Football Match Annotation	Silvio Barra	2021-03-04 10:38:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02938v1	In the last years, scientific and industrial research has experienced a growing interest in acquiring large annotated data sets to train artificial intelligence algorithms for tackling problems in different domains. In this context, we have observed that even the market for football data has substantially grown. The analysis of football matches relies on the annotation of both individual players' and team actions, as well as the athletic performance of players. Consequently, annotating football events at a fine-grained level is a very expensive and error-prone task. Most existing semi-automatic tools for football match annotation rely on cameras and computer vision. However, those tools fall short in capturing team dynamics, and in extracting data of players who are not visible in the camera frame. To address these issues, in this manuscript we present FootApp, an AI-based system for football match annotation. First, our system relies on an advanced and mixed user interface that exploits both vocal and touch interaction. Second, the motor performance of players is captured and processed by applying machine learning algorithms to data collected from inertial sensors worn by players. Artificial intelligence techniques are then used to check the consistency of generated labels, including those regarding the physical activity of players, to automatically recognize annotation errors. Notably, we implemented a full prototype of the proposed system, performing experiments to show its effectiveness in a real-world adoption scenario.			arxiv	['Salvatore M.

128	Going Deep: Models for Continuous-Time Within-Play Valuation of Game Outcomes in American Football with Tracking Data	Ronald Yurko	2019-06-05 00:21:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01760v3	Continuous-time assessments of game outcomes in sports have become increasingly common in the last decade. In American football, only discrete-time estimates of play value were possible, since the most advanced public football datasets were recorded at the play-by-play level. While measures such as expected points and win probability are useful for evaluating football plays and game situations, there has been no research into how these values change throughout the course of a play. In this work, we make two main contributions: First, we introduce a general framework for continuous-time within-play valuation in the National Football League using player-tracking data. Our modular framework incorporates several modular sub-models, to easily incorporate recent work involving player tracking data in football. Second, we use a long short-term memory recurrent neural network to construct a ball-carrier model to estimate how many yards the ball-carrier is expected to gain from their current position, conditional on the locations and trajectories of the ball-carrier, their teammates and opponents. Additionally, we demonstrate an extension with conditional density estimation so that the expectation of any measure of play value can be calculated in continuous-time, which was never before possible at such a granular level.			arxiv	['Francesca Matano', 'Lee F.

129	An Empirical Study on Google Research Football Multi-agent Scenarios	Yan Song	2023-05-16 14:18:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09458v1	Few multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) research on Google Research Football (GRF) focus on the 11v11 multi-agent full-game scenario and to the best of our knowledge, no open benchmark on this scenario has been released to the public. In this work, we fill the gap by providing a population-based MARL training pipeline and hyperparameter settings on multi-agent football scenario that outperforms the bot with difficulty 1.0 from scratch within 2 million steps. Our experiments serve as a reference for the expected performance of Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO), a state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm where each agent tries to maximize its own policy independently across various training configurations. Meanwhile, we open-source our training framework Light-MALib which extends the MALib codebase by distributed and asynchronized implementation with additional analytical tools for football games. Finally, we provide guidance for building strong football AI with population-based training and release diverse pretrained policies for benchmarking. The goal is to provide the community with a head start for whoever experiment their works on GRF and a simple-to-use population-based training framework for further improving their agents through self-play. The implementation is available at https://github.com/Shanghai-Digital-Brain-Laboratory/DB-Football.			arxiv	['He Jiang', 'Zheng Tian', 'Haifeng Zhang', 'Yingping Zhang', 'Jiangcheng Zhu', 'Zonghong Dai', 'Weinan Zhang', 'Jun Wang']	30.0

136	Fantasy Football Prediction	Roman Lutz	2015-05-26 12:14:56	http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06918v1	The ubiquity of professional sports and specifically the NFL have lead to an increase in popularity for Fantasy Football. Users have many tools at their disposal: statistics, predictions, rankings of experts and even recommendations of peers. There are issues with all of these, though. Especially since many people pay money to play, the prediction tools should be enhanced as they provide unbiased and easy-to-use assistance for users. This paper provides and discusses approaches to predict Fantasy Football scores of Quarterbacks with relatively limited data. In addition to that, it includes several suggestions on how the data could be enhanced to achieve better results. The dataset consists only of game data from the last six NFL seasons. I used two different methods to predict the Fantasy Football scores of NFL players: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Neural Networks. The results of both are promising given the limited data that was used.			arxiv	[]	37.0

We do so using only the thirty-year record of which visiting teams played which home teams, on what date, and what the final score was. No real ""statistics"" are used. The method works best in basketball, likely because it is high-scoring and has long seasons. It works better in football and hockey than in baseball, but in baseball the predictions are closer to a theoretical optimum. The football predictions, while good, can in principle be made much better, and the hockey predictions can be made somewhat better. These findings tells us that in basketball, most statistics are subsumed by the scores of the games, whereas in football, further study of game and player statistics is necessary to predict games as well as can be done. Baseball and hockey lie somewhere in between."			arxiv	[]	38.0
138	Identifying top football players and springboard clubs from a football player collaboration and club transfer networks	Matic Tribušon	2016-02-11 10:21:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03664v1	We consider all players and clubs in top twenty world football leagues in the last fifteen seasons. The purpose of this paper is to reveal top football players and identify springboard clubs. To do that, we construct two separate weighted networks. Player collaboration network consists of players, that are connected to each other if they ever played together at the same club. In directed club transfer network, clubs are connected if players were ever transferred from one club to another. To get meaningful results, we perform different network analysis methods on our networks. Our approach based on PageRank reveals Christiano Ronaldo as the top player. Using a variation of betweenness centrality, we identify Standard Liege as the best springboard club.			arxiv	['Matevž Lenič']	39.0

This paper reviews the methodology of designing an efficiency rating model for assessing sports entities, focusing on the experience of Russian football. The Russian Regional Efficiency of Football Development model aims to evaluate the regional federations of the Football Union of Russian via 5 dimensions. The scoring method of the model is based on the three-sigma rule of distribution. Support factors in the form of population density and climate were also included, since Russian regions significantly differentiate in these aspects. The findings of this paper showcased that not a single region was able to achieve a maximum 5- star rating, while regions set to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup did not score better compared to others. In conclusion the authors provide various suggestions on further developing and implementing rating models within global sports organizations.			arxiv	['Anatoly Vorobyev', 'Elnura Irmatova', 'Nikita Osokin']	40.0

We identify major confounding factors for researchers examining racial bias in FOOTBALL, and perform a computational analysis that supports conclusions from prior social science studies.			arxiv	"['Luke Yeh', 'Abram Handler', 'Alvin Grissom II', ""Brendan O'Connor"", 'Mohit Iyyer']"	41.0
141	Maximizing performance with an eye on the finances: a chance-constrained model for football transfer market decisions	Giovanni Pantuso	2019-11-10 08:31:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04689v2	Composing a team of professional players is among the most crucial decisions in association football. Nevertheless, transfer market decisions are often based on myopic objectives and are questionable from a financial point of view. This paper introduces a chance-constrained model to provide analytic support to club managers during transfer windows. The model seeks a top-performing team while adapting to different budgets and financial-risk profiles. In addition, it provides a new rating system that is able to numerically reflect the on-field performance of football players and thus contribute to an objective assessment of football players. The model and rating system are tested on a case study based on real market data. The data from the case study are available online for the benefit of future research.			arxiv	['Lars Magnus Hvattum']	42.0

Buldu	2020-11-11 19:04:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06014v1	We propose using Network Science as a complementary tool to analyze player and team behavior during a football match. Specifically, we introduce four kinds of networks based on different ways of interaction between players. Our approach's main novelty is to use tracking datasets to create football tracking networks, instead of constructing and analyzing the traditional networks based on events. In this way, we are able to capture player interactions that go beyond passes and introduce the concepts of (a) Ball Flow Networks, (b) Marking Networks, (c) Signed Proximity Networks and (d) Functional Coordination Networks. After defining the methodology for creating each kind of network, we show some examples using tracking datasets from four different matches of LaLiga Santander. Finally, we discuss some of the applications, limitations, and further improvements of football tracking networks.			arxiv	['D. Garrido', 'D. R. Antequera', 'J. Busquets', 'E. Estrada', 'R.

We first used random forest regression to select important variables predicting goal difference, which we used to calculate the Euclidian distances between teams. Creating a Laplacian eigenmap, we bisected the Fielder vector to identify the five major European football leagues' natural clusters. Our results showed how an unsupervised approach could successfully identify four clusters based on five basic performance metrics: shots, shots on target, shots conceded, possession, and pass success. The top two clusters identify those teams who dominate their respective leagues and are the best candidates to create the most competitive elite super league.			arxiv	['C. B. Beggs']	44.0

Which players should you draft for your team? We investigated this question using the wealth of data available from fantasy premier league football (soccer). Using the players' data from past seasons, for several seasons and several different budget constraints, we identified the highest scoring fantasy team for each season subject to each budget constraint. We then investigated quantifiable characteristics of these teams. Interestingly, across nearly every variable that is significant to the game of football and the budget, these top teams display diversity across these variables. Our results indicate that diversity is a general feature of top performing teams.			arxiv	['Jil Klünder', 'Julie Rowlett', 'Jonathan Stålberg']	45.0

For both growth and survival, it is crucial for recruiting departments to make smart choices when targeting players. Therefore, it is very important to identify the right parameters to monitor to predict market value. The following paper aims at determining the relevant features that successfully forecast future value for football players. Success is measured against their market value from TransferMarkt. To select prominent features, we use Lasso regressions and Random Forest algorithms. Some obvious variables are selected but we also observe some subtle dependencies between features and future market value. Finally, we rank the Golden Boy nominees using our forecasts and show our methodology can successfully compare football players based on their quality.			arxiv	['Elsa Bismuth', 'Aurèle Bohbot', 'Sébastien Coustou', 'Mathieu Lacome', 'Mathieu Rosenbaum']	46.0

Existing work has focused on tackling simplified scenarios of the game, or else leveraging expert demonstrations. In this paper, we develop a multi-agent system to play the full 11 vs. 11 game mode, without demonstrations. This game mode contains aspects that present major challenges to modern reinforcement learning algorithms; multi-agent coordination, long-term planning, and non-transitivity. To address these challenges, we present TiZero; a self-evolving, multi-agent system that learns from scratch. TiZero introduces several innovations, including adaptive curriculum learning, a novel self-play strategy, and an objective that optimizes the policies of multiple agents jointly. Experimentally, it outperforms previous systems by a large margin on the Google Research Football environment, increasing win rates by over 30%. To demonstrate the generality of TiZero's innovations, they are assessed on several environments beyond football; Overcooked, Multi-agent Particle-Environment, Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect-Four.			arxiv	['Shiyu Huang', 'Tim Pearce', 'Wenze Chen', 'Wei-Wei Tu']	47.0
147	Football fever: goal distributions and non-Gaussian statistics	Elmar Bittner	2006-06-01 16:42:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0606016v1	Analyzing football score data with statistical techniques, we investigate how the not purely random, but highly co-operative nature of the game is reflected in averaged properties such as the probability distributions of scored goals for the home and away teams. As it turns out, especially the tails of the distributions are not well described by the Poissonian or binomial model resulting from the assumption of uncorrelated random events. Instead, a good effective description of the data is provided by less basic distributions such as the negative binomial one or the probability densities of extreme value statistics. To understand this behavior from a microscopical point of view, however, no waiting time problem or extremal process need be invoked. Instead, modifying the Bernoulli random process underlying the Poissonian model to include a simple component of self-affirmation seems to describe the data surprisingly well and allows to understand the observed deviation from Gaussian statistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood as special cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score data from many leagues in Europe as well as from international tournaments, including data from all past tournaments of the ``FIFA World Cup'' series, and found the proposed models to be applicable rather universally. In particular, here we analyse the results of the German women's premier football league and consider the two separate German men's premier leagues in the East and West during the cold war times and the unified league after 1990 to see how scoring in football and the component of self-affirmation depend on cultural and political circumstances.			arxiv	['Andreas Nussbaumer', 'Wolfhard Janke', 'Martin Weigel']	48.0

A Statistical Analysis	Jiri Mazurek	2018-02-03 12:50:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00967v1	Many pundits and fans ask themselves the same question: Which football player bears most resemblance to Lionel Messi? Is it Chelsea's Eden Hazard? Is it Paulo Dybala, the heir to Messi in the national team of Argentina? Or is the most alike player to Messi someone completely else? In general, the research on the evaluation of players' performances originated in the context of baseball in the USA, but, currently, it is of great importance in almost every team sport on the planet. Specifically, football clubs' managers can use the data on player's similarity when looking for replacement of their players by other, presumably similar ones. Also, the research in the presented direction is certainly interesting both for football pundits and football fans. Therefore, the aim of this study is to answer the question from the title with the use of the statistical analysis based on the data from ongoing league season retrieved from WhoScored (WS) database. WS provides detailed data (up to 24 parameters such as goals scored, the number of assists, shots on goal, passes, dribbles or fouls) for players of TOP 5 European leagues, and ranks them with respect to their overall performance. For this study, 17 parameters (criteria) most relevant for an attacking player were used, and a set of 28 players, candidates to be 'most alike to Messi' from WS TOP 100 list were selected. After data normalization and application of a proper metric function the most similar player to Lionel Messi was found.			arxiv	[]	49.0
149	Football is becoming more predictable; Network analysis of 88 thousands matches in 11 major leagues	Victor Martins Maimone	2019-08-23 19:25:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08991v2	In recent years excessive monetization of football and professionalism among the players has been argued to have affected the quality of the match in different ways. On the one hand, playing football has become a high-income profession and the players are highly motivated; on the other hand, stronger teams have higher incomes and therefore afford better players leading to an even stronger appearance in tournaments that can make the game more imbalanced and hence predictable. To quantify and document this observation, in this work we take a minimalist network science approach to measure the predictability of football over 26 years in major European leagues. We show that over time, the games in major leagues have indeed become more predictable. We provide further support for this observation by showing that inequality between teams has increased and the home-field advantage has been vanishing ubiquitously. We do not include any direct analysis on the effects of monetization on football's predictability or therefore, lack of excitement, however, we propose several hypotheses which could be tested in future analyses.			arxiv	['Taha Yasseri']	50.0
150	Genre determining prediction: Non-standard TAM marking in football language	Jakob Egetenmeyer	2021-06-30 08:01:57	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15872v1	German and French football language display tense-aspect-mood (TAM) forms which differ from the TAM use in other genres. In German football talk, the present indicative may replace the pluperfect subjunctive. In French reports of football matches, the imperfective past may occur instead of a perfective past tense-aspect form. We argue that the two phenomena share a functional core and are licensed in the same way, which is a direct result of the genre they occur in. More precisely, football match reports adhere to a precise script and specific events are temporally determined in terms of objective time. This allows speakers to exploit a secondary function of TAM forms, namely, they shift the temporal perspective. We argue that it is on the grounds of the genre that comprehenders predict the deviating forms and are also able to decode them. We present various corpus studies where we explore the functioning of these phenomena in order to gain insights into their distribution, grammaticalization and their functioning in discourse. Relevant factors are Aktionsart properties, rhetorical relations and their interaction with other TAM forms. This allows us to discuss coping mechanisms on the part of the comprehender. We broaden our understanding of the phenomena, which have only been partly covered for French and up to now seem to have been ignored in German.			arxiv	[]	51.0
151	Automatic event detection in football using tracking data	Ferran Vidal-Codina	2022-02-01 23:20:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00804v3	One of the main shortcomings of event data in football, which has been extensively used for analytics in the recent years, is that it still requires manual collection, thus limiting its availability to a reduced number of tournaments. In this work, we propose a deterministic decision tree-based algorithm to automatically extract football events using tracking data, which consists of two steps: (1) a possession step that evaluates which player was in possession of the ball at each frame in the tracking data, as well as the distinct player configurations during the time intervals where the ball is not in play to inform set piece detection; (2) an event detection step that combines the changes in ball possession computed in the first step with the laws of football to determine in-game events and set pieces. The automatically generated events are benchmarked against manually annotated events and we show that in most event categories the proposed methodology achieves $+90\%$ detection rate across different tournaments and tracking data providers. Finally, we demonstrate how the contextual information offered by tracking data can be leveraged to increase the granularity of auto-detected events, and exhibit how the proposed framework may be used to conduct a myriad of data analyses in football.			arxiv	['Nicolas Evans', 'Bahaeddine El Fakir', 'Johsan Billingham']	52.0
152	Graph Neural Network based Agent in Google Research Football	Yizhan Niu	2022-04-23 21:26:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11142v1	Deep neural networks (DNN) can approximate value functions or policies for reinforcement learning, which makes the reinforcement learning algorithms more powerful. However, some DNNs, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), cannot extract enough information or take too long to obtain enough features from the inputs under specific circumstances of reinforcement learning. For example, the input data of Google Research Football, a reinforcement learning environment which trains agents to play football, is the small map of players' locations. The information is contained not only in the coordinates of players, but also in the relationships between different players. CNNs can neither extract enough information nor take too long to train. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep q-learning network (DQN) with a graph neural network (GNN) as its model. The GNN transforms the input data into a graph which better represents the football players' locations so that it extracts more information of the interactions between different players. With two GNNs to approximate its local and target value functions, this DQN allows players to learn from their experience by using value functions to see the prospective value of each intended action. The proposed model demonstrated the power of GNN in the football game by outperforming other DRL models with significantly fewer steps.			arxiv	['Jinglong Liu', 'Yuhao Shi', 'Jiren Zhu']	53.0
153	Automated player identification and indexing using two-stage deep learning network	Hongshan Liu	2022-04-26 02:59:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13809v2	American football games attract significant worldwide attention every year. Identifying players from videos in each play is also essential for the indexing of player participation. Processing football game video presents great challenges such as crowded settings, distorted objects, and imbalanced data for identifying players, especially jersey numbers. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based player tracking system to automatically track players and index their participation per play in American football games. It is a two-stage network design to highlight areas of interest and identify jersey number information with high accuracy. First, we utilize an object detection network, a detection transformer, to tackle the player detection problem in a crowded context. Second, we identify players using jersey number recognition with a secondary convolutional neural network, then synchronize it with a game clock subsystem. Finally, the system outputs a complete log in a database for play indexing. We demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of player tracking system by analyzing the qualitative and quantitative results on football videos. The proposed system shows great potential for implementation in and analysis of football broadcast video.			arxiv	['Colin Aderon', 'Noah Wagon', 'Abdul Latif Bamba', 'Xueshen Li', 'Huapu Liu', 'Steven MacCall', 'Yu Gan']	54.0
154	Explainable expected goal models for performance analysis in football analytics	Mustafa Cavus	2022-06-14 23:56:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07212v2	The expected goal provides a more representative measure of the team and player performance which also suit the low-scoring nature of football instead of score in modern football. The score of a match involves randomness and often may not represent the performance of the teams and players, therefore it has been popular to use the alternative statistics in recent years such as shots on target, ball possessions, and drills. To measure the probability of a shot being a goal by the expected goal, several features are used to train an expected goal model which is based on the event and tracking football data. The selection of these features, the size and date of the data, and the model which are used as the parameters that may affect the performance of the model. Using black-box machine learning models for increasing the predictive performance of the model decreases its interpretability that causes the loss of information that can be gathered from the model. This paper proposes an accurate expected goal model trained consisting of 315,430 shots from seven seasons between 2014-15 and 2020-21 of the top-five European football leagues. Moreover, this model is explained by using explainable artificial intelligence tool to obtain an explainable expected goal model for evaluating a team or player performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that demonstrates a practical application of an explainable artificial intelligence tool aggregated profiles to explain a group of observations on an accurate expected goal model for monitoring the team and player performance. Moreover, these methods can be generalized to other sports branches.			arxiv	['Przemysław Biecek']	55.0
155	Towards Active Learning for Action Spotting in Association Football Videos	Silvio Giancola	2023-04-09 11:50:41	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04220v1	Association football is a complex and dynamic sport, with numerous actions occurring simultaneously in each game. Analyzing football videos is challenging and requires identifying subtle and diverse spatio-temporal patterns. Despite recent advances in computer vision, current algorithms still face significant challenges when learning from limited annotated data, lowering their performance in detecting these patterns. In this paper, we propose an active learning framework that selects the most informative video samples to be annotated next, thus drastically reducing the annotation effort and accelerating the training of action spotting models to reach the highest accuracy at a faster pace. Our approach leverages the notion of uncertainty sampling to select the most challenging video clips to train on next, hastening the learning process of the algorithm. We demonstrate that our proposed active learning framework effectively reduces the required training data for accurate action spotting in football videos. We achieve similar performances for action spotting with NetVLAD++ on SoccerNet-v2, using only one-third of the dataset, indicating significant capabilities for reducing annotation time and improving data efficiency. We further validate our approach on two new datasets that focus on temporally localizing actions of headers and passes, proving its effectiveness across different action semantics in football. We believe our active learning framework for action spotting would support further applications of action spotting algorithms and accelerate annotation campaigns in the sports domain.			arxiv	['Anthony Cioppa', 'Julia Georgieva', 'Johsan Billingham', 'Andreas Serner', 'Kerry Peek', 'Bernard Ghanem', 'Marc Van Droogenbroeck']	56.0
156	Boosting Studies of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning on Google Research Football Environment: the Past, Present, and Future	Yan Song	2023-09-22 15:50:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12951v1	Even though Google Research Football (GRF) was initially benchmarked and studied as a single-agent environment in its original paper, recent years have witnessed an increasing focus on its multi-agent nature by researchers utilizing it as a testbed for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, the absence of standardized environment settings and unified evaluation metrics for multi-agent scenarios hampers the consistent understanding of various studies. Furthermore, the challenging 5-vs-5 and 11-vs-11 full-game scenarios have received limited thorough examination due to their substantial training complexities. To address these gaps, this paper extends the original environment by not only standardizing the environment settings and benchmarking cooperative learning algorithms across different scenarios, including the most challenging full-game scenarios, but also by discussing approaches to enhance football AI from diverse perspectives and introducing related research tools. Specifically, we provide a distributed and asynchronous population-based self-play framework with diverse pre-trained policies for faster training, two football-specific analytical tools for deeper investigation, and an online leaderboard for broader evaluation. The overall expectation of this work is to advance the study of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning on Google Research Football environment, with the ultimate goal of benefiting real-world sports beyond virtual games.			arxiv	['He Jiang', 'Haifeng Zhang', 'Zheng Tian', 'Weinan Zhang', 'Jun Wang']	57.0

Deshpande	2018-08-12 12:46:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03934v2	More than 1 million students play high school American football annually, but many health professionals have recently questioned its safety or called for its ban. These concerns have been partially driven by reports of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), increased risks of neurodegenerative disease, and associations between concussion history and later-life cognitive impairment and depression among retired professional football players. A recent observational study of a cohort of men who graduated from a Wisconsin high school in 1957 found no statistically significant harmful effects of playing high school football on a range of cognitive, psychological, and socio-economic outcomes measured at ages 35, 54, 65, and 72. Unfortunately, these findings may not generalize to younger populations, thanks to changes and improvements in football helmet technology and training techniques. In particular, these changes may have led to increased perceptions of safety but ultimately more dangerous styles of play, characterized by the frequent sub-concussive impacts thought to be associated with later-life neurological decline. In this work, we replicate the methodology of that earlier matched observational study using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). These include adolescent and family co-morbidities, academic experience, self-reported levels of general health and physical activity, and the score on the Add Health Picture Vocabulary Test. Our primary outcome is the CES-D score measured in 2008 when subjects were aged 24 -- 34 and settling into early adulthood. We also examine several secondary outcomes related to physical and psychological health, including suicidality. Our results can provide insight into the natural history of potential football-related decline and dysfunction.			arxiv	['Raiden B. Hasegawa', 'Jordan Weiss', 'Dylan S. Small']	58.0
158	Game Plan: What AI can do for Football, and What Football can do for AI	Karl Tuyls	2020-11-18 10:26:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09192v1	The rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has opened unprecedented analytics possibilities in various team and individual sports, including baseball, basketball, and tennis. More recently, AI techniques have been applied to football, due to a huge increase in data collection by professional teams, increased computational power, and advances in machine learning, with the goal of better addressing new scientific challenges involved in the analysis of both individual players' and coordinated teams' behaviors. The research challenges associated with predictive and prescriptive football analytics require new developments and progress at the intersection of statistical learning, game theory, and computer vision. In this paper, we provide an overarching perspective highlighting how the combination of these fields, in particular, forms a unique microcosm for AI research, while offering mutual benefits for professional teams, spectators, and broadcasters in the years to come. We illustrate that this duality makes football analytics a game changer of tremendous value, in terms of not only changing the game of football itself, but also in terms of what this domain can mean for the field of AI. We review the state-of-the-art and exemplify the types of analysis enabled by combining the aforementioned fields, including illustrative examples of counterfactual analysis using predictive models, and the combination of game-theoretic analysis of penalty kicks with statistical learning of player attributes. We conclude by highlighting envisioned downstream impacts, including possibilities for extensions to other sports (real and virtual).			arxiv	['Shayegan Omidshafiei', 'Paul Muller', 'Zhe Wang', 'Jerome Connor', 'Daniel Hennes', 'Ian Graham', 'William Spearman', 'Tim Waskett', 'Dafydd Steele', 'Pauline Luc', 'Adria Recasens', 'Alexandre Galashov', 'Gregory Thornton', 'Romuald Elie', 'Pablo Sprechmann', 'Pol Moreno', 'Kris Cao', 'Marta Garnelo', 'Praneet Dutta', 'Michal Valko', 'Nicolas Heess', 'Alex Bridgland', 'Julien Perolat', 'Bart De Vylder', 'Ali Eslami', 'Mark Rowland', 'Andrew Jaegle', 'Remi Munos', 'Trevor Back', 'Razia Ahamed', 'Simon Bouton', 'Nathalie Beauguerlange', 'Jackson Broshear', 'Thore Graepel', 'Demis Hassabis']	59.0
159	Deep Artificial Intelligence for Fantasy Football Language Understanding	Aaron Baughman	2021-11-04 14:02:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02874v1	Fantasy sports allow fans to manage a team of their favorite athletes and compete with friends. The fantasy platform aligns the real-world statistical performance of athletes to fantasy scoring and has steadily risen in popularity to an estimated 9.1 million players per month with 4.4 billion player card views on the ESPN Fantasy Football platform from 2018-2019. In parallel, the sports media community produces news stories, blogs, forum posts, tweets, videos, podcasts and opinion pieces that are both within and outside the context of fantasy sports. However, human fantasy football players can only analyze an average of 3.9 sources of information. Our work discusses the results of a machine learning pipeline to manage an ESPN Fantasy Football team. The use of trained statistical entity detectors and document2vector models applied to over 100,000 news sources and 2.3 million articles, videos and podcasts each day enables the system to comprehend natural language with an analogy test accuracy of 100% and keyword test accuracy of 80%. Deep learning feedforward neural networks provide player classifications such as if a player will be a bust, boom, play with a hidden injury or play meaningful touches with a cumulative 72% accuracy. Finally, a multiple regression ensemble uses the deep learning output and ESPN projection data to provide a point projection for each of the top 500+ fantasy football players in 2018. The point projection maintained a RMSE of 6.78 points. The best fit probability density function from a set of 24 is selected to visualize score spreads. Within the first 6 weeks of the product launch, the total number of users spent a cumulative time of over 4.6 years viewing our AI insights. The training data for our models was provided by a 2015 to 2016 web archive from Webhose, ESPN statistics, and Rotowire injury reports. We used 2017 fantasy football data as a test set.			arxiv	['Micah Forester', 'Jeff Powell', 'Eduardo Morales', 'Shaun McPartlin', 'Daniel Bohm']	60.0
160	A Machine Learning Approach for Player and Position Adjusted Expected Goals in Football (Soccer)	James H. Hewitt	2023-01-19 22:17:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13052v2	Football is a very result-driven industry, with goals being rarer than in most sports, so having further parameters to judge the performance of teams and individuals is key. Expected Goals (xG) allow further insight than just a scoreline. To tackle the need for further analysis in football, this paper uses machine learning applications that are developed and applied to Football Event data. From the concept, a Binary Classification problem is created whereby a probabilistic valuation is outputted using Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting based approaches. The model successfully predicts xGs probability values for football players based on 15,575 shots. The proposed solution utilises StatsBomb as the data provider and an industry benchmark to tune the models in the right direction. The proposed ML solution for xG is further used to tackle the age-old cliche of: 'the ball has fallen to the wrong guy there'. The development of the model is used to adjust and gain more realistic values of expected goals than the general models show. To achieve this, this paper tackles Positional Adjusted xG, splitting the training data into Forward, Midfield, and Defence with the aim of providing insight into player qualities based on their positional sub-group. Positional Adjusted xG successfully predicts and proves that more attacking players are better at accumulating xG. The highest value belonged to Forwards followed by Midfielders and Defenders. Finally, this study has further developments into Player Adjusted xG with the aim of proving that Messi is statistically at a higher efficiency level than the average footballer. This is achieved by using Messi subset samples to quantify his qualities in comparison to the average xG models finding that Messi xG performs 347 xG higher than the general model outcome.			arxiv	['Oktay Karakuş']	61.0

The result is obtained on the basis of data taken from the Spanish Professional League, that show a high number of shots-to-post. Surprisingly, there is a direct correlation of the increase in goal mouth area with the increase of goals.			arxiv	[]	63.0

164	The Sensitivity of College Football Rankings to Several Modeling Choices	Andrew T.

The model results in an intractable, high-dimensional integral due to the random effects structure and nonlinear link function. We use recent data sets to explore the effect of the choice of integral approximation and other modeling assumptions on the rankings. Varying the modeling assumptions sometimes leads to changes in the team rankings that could affect bowl assignments.			arxiv	[]	65.0
165	A Markovian model for association football possession and its outcomes	Javier López Peña	2014-03-31 13:45:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.7993v1	We propose a bottom-up approach to the study of possession and its outcomes for association football, based on probabilistic finite state automata with transition probabilities described by a Markov process. We show how even a very simple model yields faithful approximations to the distribution of passing sequences and chances of taking shots for English Premier League teams, which we fit using a whole season of granular game data (380 games). We compare the resulting model with classical top-down distributions traditionally used to describe possessions, showing that the Markov models yield a more accurate asymptotic behaviour.			arxiv	[]	66.0

In this network, a player on a certain area in the divided fields is a node, and a pass between two nodes corresponds to an edge. Our model is characterized by the consecutive choice of a node dependent on its intrinsic fitness. We derive the explicit expression of the degree distribution, and find that the derived distribution reproduces the real data quit well.			arxiv	['Ken Yamamoto', 'Yoshihiro Yamazaki']	67.0

169	On convergence to a football	Hao Fang	2015-01-27 19:44:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06881v2	We show that spheres of positive constant curvature with $n$ ($n\geq3$) conic points converge to a sphere of positive constant curvature with two conic points (or called an (American) football) in Gromov-Hausdorff topology when the corresponding singular divisors converge to a critical divisor in the sense of Troyanov. We prove this convergence in two different ways. Geometrically, the convergence follows from Luo-Tian's explicit description of conic spheres as boundaries of convex polytopes in $S^{3}$. Analytically, regarding the conformal factors as the singular solutions to the corresponding PDE, we derive the required a priori estimates and convergence result after proper reparametrization.			arxiv	['Mijia Lai']	70.0

Our method first clusters formations into several average formations: `442,' `4141,' `433,' `541,' and `343.' Then, each average formation is further divided into more specific patterns in which the configurations of players are slightly different. The latter step is based on hierarchical clustering and the Delaunay method, which defines the formation of a team as an adjacency matrix of Delaunay triangulation. A formation clustered using our method is expressed in a form such as `442-C1'.			arxiv	['Yoshihiro Yamazaki']	71.0

Our data consists of roughly 50,000 penalties from the eleven~most recent seasons in European men's football competitions. About one third of the penalties are from more than 1,500 penalty shootouts. We find that shootout conversion rates are significantly lower, and attribute this to worse performance of shooters rather than better performance of goalkeepers. We also find that, statistically, there is no advantage for either team in the usual alternating shooting order.

Buldu	2019-09-19 10:14:50	http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08903v1	The application of Network Science to social systems has introduced new methodologies to analyze classical problems such as the emergence of epidemics, the arousal of cooperation between individuals or the propagation of information along social networks. More recently, the organization of football teams and their performance have been unveiled using metrics coming from Network Science, where a team is considered as a complex network whose nodes (i.e., players) interact with the aim of overcoming the opponent network. Here, we combine the use of different network metrics to extract the particular signature of the F.C. Barcelona coached by Guardiola, which has been considered one of the best teams along football history. We have first compared the network organization of Guardiola's team with their opponents along one season of the Spanish national league, identifying those metrics with statistically significant differences and relating them with the Guardiola's game. Next, we have focused on the temporal nature of football passing networks and calculated the evolution of all network properties along a match, instead of considering their average. In this way, we are able to identify those network metrics that enhance the probability of scoring/receiving a goal, showing that not all teams behave in the same way and how the organization Guardiola's F.C. Barcelona is different from the rest, including its clustering coefficient, shortest-path length, largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix, algebraic connectivity and centrality distribution.			arxiv	['J.

Lopez	2019-09-23 21:47:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10631v3	Most historical National Football League (NFL) analysis, both mainstream and academic, has relied on public, play-level data to generate team and player comparisons. Given the number of oft omitted variables that impact on-field results, such as play call, game situation, and opponent strength, findings tend to be more anecdotal than actionable. With the release of player tracking data, however, analysts can better ask and answer questions to isolate skill and strategy. In this article, we highlight the limitations of traditional analyses, and use a decades-old punching bag for analysts, fourth-down strategy, as a microcosm for why tracking data is needed. Specifically, we assert that, in absence of using the precise yardage needed for a first down, past findings supporting an aggressive fourth down strategy may have been overstated. Next, we synthesize recent work that comprises this special Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports issue into player tracking data in football. Finally, we conclude with some best practices and limitations regarding usage of this data. The release of player tracking data marks a transition for the league and its' analysts, and we hope this issue helps guide innovation in football analytics for years to come.			arxiv	[]	86.0
186	Space evaluation in football games via field weighting based on tracking data	Takuma Narizuka	2020-01-31 02:05:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11629v2	In football game analysis, space evaluation is an important issue because it is directly related to the quality of ball passing or player formations. Previous studies have primarily focused on a field division approach wherein a field is divided into dominant regions in which a certain player can arrive prior to any other players. However, the field division approach is oversimplified because all locations within a region are regarded as uniform herein. The objective of the current study is to propose a fundamental framework for space evaluation based on field weighting. In particular, we employed the motion model and calculated a minimum arrival time $ \tau $ for each player to all locations on the football field. Our main contribution is that two variables $ \tau_{\textrm{of}} $ and $ \tau_{\textrm{df}} $ corresponding to the minimum arrival time for offense and defense teams are considered; using $ \tau_{\textrm{of}} $ and $ \tau_{\textrm{df}} $, new orthogonal variables $ z_{1} $ and $ z_{2} $ are defined. In particular, based on real datasets comprising of data from 45 football games of the J1 League in 2018, we provide a detailed characterization of $ z_{1} $ and $ z_{2} $ in terms of ball passing. By using our method, we found that $ z_{1}(\vec{x}, t) $ and $ z_{2}(\vec{x}, t) $ represent the degree of safety for a pass made to $ \vec{x} $ at $ t $ and degree of sparsity of $ \vec{x} $ at $ t $, respectively; the success probability of passes could be well-fitted using a sigmoid function. Moreover, a new type of field division approach and evaluation of ball passing just before shoots using real game data are discussed.			arxiv	['Yoshihiro Yamazaki', 'Kenta Takizawa']	87.0

However, current DRL systems still suffer from challenges of multi-agent coordination, sparse rewards, stochastic environments, etc. In seeking to address these challenges, we employ a football video game, e.g., Google Research Football (GRF), as our testbed and develop an end-to-end learning-based AI system (denoted as TiKick) to complete this challenging task. In this work, we first generated a large replay dataset from the self-playing of single-agent experts, which are obtained from league training. We then developed a distributed learning system and new offline algorithms to learn a powerful multi-agent AI from the fixed single-agent dataset. To the best of our knowledge, Tikick is the first learning-based AI system that can take over the multi-agent Google Research Football full game, while previous work could either control a single agent or experiment on toy academic scenarios. Extensive experiments further show that our pre-trained model can accelerate the training process of the modern multi-agent algorithm and our method achieves state-of-the-art performances on various academic scenarios.			arxiv	['Wenze Chen', 'Longfei Zhang', 'Shizhen Xu', 'Ziyang Li', 'Fengming Zhu', 'Deheng Ye', 'Ting Chen', 'Jun Zhu']	88.0

Renkin	2022-04-07 08:34:19	http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13992v1	Modelling the trajectorial motion of humans along the ground is a foundational task in the quantitative analysis of sports like association football. Most existing models of football player motion have not been validated yet with respect to actual data. One of the reasons for this lack is that performing such a validation is not straightforward, because models of player motion are usually phrased in a way that emphasises possibly reachable positions rather than expected positions. Since positional data of football players typically contains outliers, this data may misrepresent the range of actually reachable positions. This paper proposes a validation routine for trajectorial motion models that measures and optimises the ability of a motion model to accurately predict all possibly reachable positions by favoring the smallest predicted area of reachable positions that encompasses all observed reached positions up to a manually defined threshold. We demonstrate validation and optimisation on four different motion models, assuming (a) motion with constant speed, (b) motion with constant acceleration, (c) motion with constant acceleration with a speed limit, and (d) motion along two segments with constant speed. Our results show that assuming motion with constant speed or constant acceleration without a limit on the achievable speed is particularly inappropriate for an accurate distinction between reachable and unreachable locations. Motion along two segments of constant speed provides by far the highest accuracy among the tested models and serves as an efficient and accurate approximation of real-world player motion.			arxiv	['J.

189	Characterizing player's playing styles based on Player Vectors for each playing position in the Chinese Football Super League	Yuesen Li	2022-05-05 16:05:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02731v2	Characterizing playing style is important for football clubs on scouting, monitoring and match preparation. Previous studies considered a player's style as a combination of technical performances, failing to consider the spatial information. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the playing styles of each playing position in the Chinese Football Super League (CSL) matches, integrating a recently adopted Player Vectors framework. Data of 960 matches from 2016-2019 CSL were used. Match ratings, and ten types of match events with the corresponding coordinates for all the lineup players whose on-pitch time exceeded 45 minutes were extracted. Players were first clustered into 8 positions. A player vector was constructed for each player in each match based on the Player Vectors using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Another NMF process was run on the player vectors to extract different types of playing styles. The resulting player vectors discovered 18 different playing styles in the CSL. Six performance indicators of each style were investigated to observe their contributions. In general, the playing styles of forwards and midfielders are in line with football performance evolution trends, while the styles of defenders should be reconsidered. Multifunctional playing styles were also found in high rated CSL players.			arxiv	['Shouxin Zong', 'Yanfei Shen', 'Zhiqiang Pu', 'Miguel-Ángel Gómez', 'Yixiong Cui']	90.0
190	Identifying and Extracting Football Features from Real-World Media Sources using Only Synthetic Training Data	Jose Cerqueira Fernandes	2022-09-27 08:48:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13254v1	Real-world images used for training machine learning algorithms are often unstructured and inconsistent. The process of analysing and tagging these images can be costly and error prone (also availability, gaps and legal conundrums). However, as we demonstrate in this article, the potential to generate accurate graphical images that are indistinguishable from real-world sources has a multitude of benefits in machine learning paradigms. One such example of this is football data from broadcast services (television and other streaming media sources). The football games are usually recorded from multiple sources (cameras and phones) and resolutions, not to mention, occlusion of visual details and other artefacts (like blurring, weathering and lighting conditions) which make it difficult to accurately identify features. We demonstrate an approach which is able to overcome these limitations using generated tagged and structured images. The generated images are able to simulate a variety views and conditions (including noise and blurring) which may only occur sporadically in real-world data and make it difficult for machine learning algorithm to 'cope' with these unforeseen problems in real-data. This approach enables us to rapidly train and prepare a robust solution that accurately extracts features (e.g., spacial locations, markers on the pitch, player positions, ball location and camera FOV) from real-world football match sources for analytical purposes.			arxiv	['Benjamin Kenwright']	91.0
191	Betting the system: Using lineups to predict football scores	George Peters	2022-10-12 15:47:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06327v3	This paper aims to reduce randomness in football by analysing the role of lineups in final scores using machine learning prediction models we have developed. Football clubs invest millions of dollars on lineups and knowing how individual statistics translate to better outcomes can optimise investments. Moreover, sports betting is growing exponentially and being able to predict the future is profitable and desirable. We use machine learning models and historical player data from English Premier League (2020-2022) to predict scores and to understand how individual performance can improve the outcome of a match. We compared different prediction techniques to maximise the possibility of finding useful models. We created heuristic and machine learning models predicting football scores to compare different techniques. We used different sets of features and shown goalkeepers stats are more important than attackers stats to predict goals scored. We applied a broad evaluation process to assess the efficacy of the models in real world applications. We managed to predict correctly all relegated teams after forecast 100 consecutive matches. We show that Support Vector Regression outperformed other techniques predicting final scores and that lineups do not improve predictions. Finally, our model was profitable (42% return) when emulating a betting system using real world odds data.			arxiv	['Diogo Pacheco']	92.0
192	Partially Constrained Group Variable Selection to Adjust for Complementary Unit Performance in American College Football	Andrey Skripnikov	2022-10-22 18:38:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12519v1	Given the importance of accurate team rankings in American college football (CFB) -- due to heavy title and playoff implications -- strides have been made to improve evaluation metrics across statistical categories, going from basic averages (e.g. points scored per game) to metrics that adjust for a team's strength of schedule, but one aspect that hasn't been emphasized is the complementary nature of American football. Despite the same team's offensive and defensive units typically consisting of separate player sets, some aspects of your team's defensive (offensive) performance may affect the complementary side: turnovers forced by your defense could lead to easier scoring chances for your offense, while your offense's ability to control the clock may help your defense. For 2009-2019 CFB seasons, we incorporate natural splines with group penalty approaches to identify the most consistently influential features of complementary football in a data-driven way, conducting partially constrained optimization in order to additionally guarantee the full adjustment for strength of schedule and homefield factor. We touch on the issues arising due to reverse-causal nature of certain within-game dynamics, discussing several potential remedies. Lastly, game outcome prediction performances are compared across several ranking adjustment approaches for method validation purposes.			arxiv	[]	93.0
193	Design and Implementation of A Soccer Ball Detection System with Multiple Cameras	Lei Li	2023-01-31 22:04:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00123v1	The detection of small and medium-sized objects in three dimensions has always been a frontier exploration problem. This technology has a very wide application in sports analysis, games, virtual reality, human animation and other fields. The traditional three-dimensional small target detection technology has the disadvantages of high cost, low precision and inconvenience, so it is difficult to apply in practice. With the development of machine learning and deep learning, the technology of computer vision algorithms is becoming more mature. Creating an immersive media experience is considered to be a very important research work in sports. The main work is to explore and solve the problem of football detection under the multiple cameras, aiming at the research and implementation of the live broadcast system of football matches. Using multi cameras detects a target ball and determines its position in three dimension with the occlusion, motion, low illumination of the target object. This paper designed and implemented football detection system under multiple cameras for the detection and capture of targets in real-time matches. The main work mainly consists of three parts, football detector, single camera detection, and multi-cameras detection. The system used bundle adjustment to obtain the three-dimensional position of the target, and the GPU to accelerates data pre-processing and achieve accurate real-time capture of the target. By testing the system, it shows that the system can accurately detect and capture the moving targets in 3D. In addition, the solution in this paper is reusable for large-scale competitions, like basketball and soccer. The system framework can be well transplanted into other similar engineering project systems. It has been put into the market.			arxiv	['Tianfang Zhang', 'Zhongfeng Kang', 'Wenhan Zhang']	94.0
194	Impact of velocity and impact angle on football shot accuracy during fundamental trainings	Rahman Sahinler	2023-02-07 12:24:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03426v1	The purpose of this research is to create a machine learning-based smart coaching approach for football that can replace manual analysis with real-time feedback for trainers. In-depth analysis of football player data by humans is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires a lot of effort. This exploratory study demonstrates the feasibility of using a machine learning algorithm to enhance the effectiveness of player monitoring and training. The suggested approach uses machine learning to generate analytical insights and enable long-term monitoring of player performance. In the future, machine learning could use this technique to offer constructive criticism of football players. The system incorporates a homemade ball-throwing mechanism capable of launching the ball in a variety of directions and at varying velocities. The ball kicker is equipped with a gyroscope and accelerometer sensors for measuring velocity and acceleration. The gathered data is filtered initially, and then the data that has been processed is fed into the machine-learning algorithm. The algorithm will be trained on player performance data and will be able to provide real-time feedback to coaches on player performance and potential areas for improvement. Additionally, the system will be able to track player progress over time and provide coaches with a comprehensive view of player development. The ultimate goal is to improve player performance and reduce the workload for coaches by automating the analysis process.			arxiv	['Omer Burak Goktas', 'Berkay Mumcu', 'Damla Sen', 'Feyza Kocaturk', 'Huseyin Uvet']	95.0
195	Deep Generative Multi-Agent Imitation Model as a Computational Benchmark for Evaluating Human Performance in Complex Interactive Tasks: A Case Study in Football	Chaoyi Gu	2023-03-23 15:01:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13323v1	Evaluating the performance of human is a common need across many applications, such as in engineering and sports. When evaluating human performance in completing complex and interactive tasks, the most common way is to use a metric having been proved efficient for that context, or to use subjective measurement techniques. However, this can be an error prone and unreliable process since static metrics cannot capture all the complex contexts associated with such tasks and biases exist in subjective measurement. The objective of our research is to create data-driven AI agents as computational benchmarks to evaluate human performance in solving difficult tasks involving multiple humans and contextual factors. We demonstrate this within the context of football performance analysis. We train a generative model based on Conditional Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) Model on a large player and ball tracking dataset. The trained model is used to imitate the interactions between two teams and predict the performance from each team. Then the trained Conditional VRNN Model is used as a benchmark to evaluate team performance. The experimental results on Premier League football dataset demonstrates the usefulness of our method to existing state-of-the-art static metric used in football analytics.			arxiv	['Varuna De Silva']	96.0
196	Here Comes the STRAIN: Analyzing Defensive Pass Rush in American Football with Player Tracking Data	Quang Nguyen	2023-05-17 14:52:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10262v3	In American football, a pass rush is an attempt by the defensive team to disrupt the offense and prevent the quarterback (QB) from completing a pass. Existing metrics for assessing pass rush performance are either discrete-time quantities or based on subjective judgment. Using player tracking data, we propose STRAIN, a novel metric for evaluating pass rushers in the National Football League (NFL) at the continuous-time within-play level. Inspired by the concept of strain rate in materials science, STRAIN is a simple and interpretable means for measuring defensive pressure in football. It is a directly-observed statistic as a function of two features: the distance between the pass rusher and QB, and the rate at which this distance is being reduced. Our metric possesses great predictability of pressure and stability over time. We also fit a multilevel model for STRAIN to understand the defensive pressure contribution of every pass rusher at the play-level. We apply our approach to NFL data and present results for the first eight weeks of the 2021 regular season. In particular, we provide comparisons of STRAIN for different defensive positions and play outcomes, and rankings of the NFL's best pass rushers according to our metric.			arxiv	['Ronald Yurko', 'Gregory J.

197	A network-based ranking system for American college football	Juyong Park	2005-05-24 17:07:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505169v4	American college football faces a conflict created by the desire to stage national championship games between the best teams of a season when there is no conventional playoff system to decide which those teams are. Instead, ranking of teams is based on their record of wins and losses during the season, but each team plays only a small fraction of eligible opponents, making the system underdetermined or contradictory or both. It is an interesting challenge to create a ranking system that at once is mathematically well-founded, gives results in general accord with received wisdom concerning the relative strengths of the teams, and is based upon intuitive principles, allowing it to be accepted readily by fans and experts alike. Here we introduce a one-parameter ranking method that satisfies all of these requirements and is based on a network representation of college football schedules.			arxiv	['M. E. J. Newman']	98.0
198	Self-affirmation model for football goal distributions	Elmar Bittner	2007-05-18 15:58:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.2724v1	Analyzing football score data with statistical techniques, we investigate how the highly co-operative nature of the game is reflected in averaged properties such as the distributions of scored goals for the home and away teams. It turns out that in particular the tails of the distributions are not well described by independent Bernoulli trials, but rather well modeled by negative binomial or generalized extreme value distributions. To understand this behavior from first principles, we suggest to modify the Bernoulli random process to include a simple component of self-affirmation which seems to describe the data surprisingly well and allows to interpret the observed deviation from Gaussian statistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood as special cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score data from many leagues in Europe as well as from international tournaments and found the proposed models to be applicable rather universally. In particular, here we compare men's and women's leagues and the separate German leagues during the cold war times and find some remarkable differences.			arxiv	['Andreas Nussbaumer', 'Wolfhard Janke', 'Martin Weigel']	99.0
199	Toward reducing impact induced brain injury: Lessons from a computational study of army and football helmet pads	W. C. Moss	2012-04-12 15:18:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2753v1	We use computational simulations to compare the impact response of different football and U.S. Army helmet pad materials. We conduct experiments to characterize the material response of different helmet pads. We simulate experimental helmet impact tests performed by the U.S. Army to validate our methods. We then simulate a cylindrical impactor striking different pads. The acceleration history of the impactor is used to calculate the Head Injury Criterion for each pad. We conduct sensitivity studies exploring the effects of pad composition, geometry, and material stiffness. We find that: (1) The football pad materials do not outperform the currently used military pad material in militarily-relevant impact scenarios; (2) Optimal material properties for a pad depend on impact energy; and (3) Thicker pads perform better at all velocities. Our analysis suggests that by using larger helmet shells with correspondingly thicker pads, impact-induced traumatic brain injury may be significantly reduced.
