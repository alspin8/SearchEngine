1	1st China Chess King Competition, featuring Ding Liren, Wei Yi, Wang Hao, Yu Yangyi	Unknown	2024-01-05 20:46:25	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18zh46m/1st_china_chess_king_competition_featuring_ding/	Current world champion Ding Liren is making an appearance, along with other Super GMs at the Rapid tournament in Chengdu, China. Model is Swiss, 8 rounds, time format 15+10. Round 1 on 2024/01/06 at 9:30 Time zone is not specified, but the Chinese stream countdown in the link below ends approx 10 hours from now, which is 8 am CET (11 pm PST, 2 am EST). Link to tournament (tournament page doesn't exist): https://chess-results.com/tnr873917.aspx?lan=1&turdet=YES Link to Chinese stream (I hope it is a stream, I used Google Translate): https://wx.vzan.com/live/page/1855545085?v=1704356671000 Is there an English-speaking chess streamer that plans to cover this tournament? I would love to watch Ding back in action after such a long hiatus, and Rapid is one of the most exciting formats out there.	15.0	t3_18zh46m	reddit

8	GM Pia Cramling is a Delightful Commentator	Unknown	2024-01-05 18:59:04	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18zeil6/gm_pia_cramling_is_a_delightful_commentator/	Over the past few weeks, I've been watching Pia's commentary of her daughter Anna's games in the Rilton ELO tournament ([VODs here](https://www.youtube.com/@AnnaCramlingExtra/videos)). Maybe this is old news, but this was my first time watching, and she's been a *spectacular* host. I don't remember the last time I've been so engaged in a chess tournament, even though I know very little about Anna. Pia is super engaged and excited, seemingly able to talk endlessly for hours on end, all while smiling. Her passion for the game is infectious and makes me want to play! Sure, part of this is probably that she's commentating games for her daughter, but she's clearly also invested for the love of chess. As for her analysis, as (EDIT for clarity: *I* am) someone who's not the greatest player, her commentary feels like the perfect level of depth for me. She doesn't dumb down her analysis - far from it - but she does take the time to explain aspects of a position that might not be so obvious to me. She goes deep into variations while still keeping tabs on overarching strategic ideas, and helps me get into the mindset of the players. Can we get her commentate some other events? I feel like she'd bring a cool perspective to other tournaments!	36.0	t3_18zeil6	reddit

10	Winning a 15|10 feels so much better than winning a blitz.	Unknown	2024-01-06 17:45:58	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1905gbu/winning_a_1510_feels_so_much_better_than_winning/	I am very new to chess and was only playing 5 minute blitz games. I would win maybe 1/10 games or so and it was frustrating me beyond belief since my blitz rating literally can‚Äôt get any lower (100 elo). I am learning the London system and studying a lot but still could not win anything. I took this subs advice and played my first slower game which was a 15|10. I ended up winning on move 38 with a Nf7#. (Game posted below if you want to check it out) I literally screamed after the game was over! Yes there were some moves I can improve on and I didn‚Äôt play perfect, but it felt way more rewarding than winning a 3 or 5 min blitz. Anyway, just thought I would share this with you guys. As a husband, father of 4, and someone who is dedicated to work, I don‚Äôt have time to participate in the local chess club, and none of my friends are into chess, so you all are the only ones who will understand and I can brag to (even though it wasn‚Äôt much). The game: 1. d4 e5 2. c3 Bd6 3. dxe5 Bxe5 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. e3 a5 6. Bd3 Qf6 7. e4 d6 8. Nbd2 Bg4 9. h3 Nh6 10. hxg4 Nxg4 11. Nc4 Nxf2 12. Kxf2 g5 13. g4 b5 14. Bxg5 Qg6 15. b4 Bxc3 16. Rc1 bxc4 17.

16	Chess-GPT, 1000x smaller than GPT-4, plays 1500 ELO chess. We can visualize its internal board state, and it accurately estimates the ELO rating of the players in a game.	Unknown	2024-01-06 17:22:32	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1904wm2/chessgpt_1000x_smaller_than_gpt4_plays_1500_elo/	"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct's ELO rating of 1800 is chess seemed magical. But it's not! A 100-1000x smaller parameter LLM given a few million games of chess will learn to play at ELO 1500. This model is only trained to predict the next character in PGN strings (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 ‚Ä¶) and is never explicitly given the state of the board or the rules of chess. Despite this, in order to better predict the next character, it learns to compute the state of the board at any point of the game, and learns a diverse set of rules, including check, checkmate, castling, en passant, promotion, pinned pieces, etc. In addition, to better predict the next character it also learns to estimate latent variables such as the ELO rating of the players in the game. &#x200B; We can visualize the internal board state of the model as it's predicting the next character. For example, in this heatmap, we have the white pawn location on the left, a binary probe output in the middle, and a gradient of probe confidence on the right. We can see the model is extremely confident that no white pawns are on either back rank. &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/0z3pvc74suac1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=54aed04c77416fa3a9384cf5ef03c61f3de2a633 I am very curious how this model learns to play well. My first idea is that it just has very good ""intuition"" about what a good move is and how to evaluate if a move is good. The second idea is that it is actually considering a range of moves, and then its opponents potential responses to those moves. Does anyone know about how well people can play purely off of intuition, without thinking about their opponent's response?

Unknown	2024-01-06 17:45:35	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1905fzz/does_practicing_chess_puzzles_actually_help/	I want to improve my game but I've been stuck at the same elo for months now. I picked up chess in 2020 around the time of the first pogchamps and all I've really done is play on [chess.com](https://chess.com/). I haven't practiced chess in any other way, not even puzzles. Despite that I've reached 1700+ elo in all formats (rapid, blitz and bullet) and peaked near 1800. Tbh I don't even play rapid, literally all I've done is grind blitz and bullet everyday (10k-15k games across all my accounts and all time controls) and my rapid naturally improved as I got better at blitz. The only openings I play are the italian, but mostly I just try to develop my pieces into the center and half the games I try to castle on the opposite side and attack. I feel like I've hit a wall and got to the point where I should practice and put in some work to see improvement. I hate doing puzzles because they are not fun to do at all. To sit there and think about the entire sequence of moves and possible enemy moves... it's just not my cup of tea. Honestly I still enjoy the game and will keep playing 3+0 even if I don't improve. I was just curious whether practicing puzzles are worthwhile if my goal is to improve my skills. Thanks.	3.0	t3_1905fzz	reddit

34	How would you rank the most prestigious chess tournaments?	 BOBBY FISCHER FANBOY	2024-01-06 11:33:30	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18zy50b/how_would_you_rank_the_most_prestigious_chess/	"Since most of the chess world cannot really decide on what the most prestigious active chess events really are (I use the adjective ""active"" to distinguish from discontinued/defunct chess events such as the Zonals/Interzonals, Linares, Dortmund, etc.), I thought it would be interesting to hold a discussion on the same topic. My personal (super subjective) top ten list would go something like: 1.) The World Chess Championship (cuz like 95% of the time it's a contest between the strongest and second strongest player in the world) 2.) The Candidates Tournament (second to the World Championship because it's the only tournament where the world champion isn't allowed to play, but most of the strongest players in the world are) 3.) The FIDE World Cup (path to most candidates events) 4.) The Grand Swiss (same as the CWC, path to most candidates events) 5.) The Grand Prix (feels like a less flashy version of the two tournaments above) 6.) Wijk aan Zee (I place it this high because of the historical context... literally every world champion since Botvinnik has participated in at least one Wijk aan Zee before (except the elusive Bobby Fischer), and, as Bent Larsen himself said, ""Normal people have to see Naples before they die... but a chess grandmaster has to win Wijk aan Zee first."") 7.) Fischer Random World Championship (here I'm just repping Fischer and Carlsen's takes of enjoying intuitive chess over prep and engine memorization) 8.) The Chess Olympiad (it's a team tournament so kinda hard to fit it in here, but I think #8 is its rightful spot) 9.) The Sinquefield Cup (they have often had incredibly strong tournaments, sometimes with all the top players attending, starting from #1) 10.) World Rapid/Blitz Championships (the funnest ones to watch, but not necessarily the most prestigious/coveted... still pretty important tho) Honourable mentions would be the GCT (multiple tournaments), Tal Memorial, Capablanca Memorial, SCC (held by [chess.com](https://chess.com)) and Norway Chess.

A good tactics/puzzle book for someone my level. I have 1001 Chess Tactics from Games of Every Day Players by Brennan and Carson which I felt was too easy, 1001 Chess Exercises for Club Players by Erwich was too difficult (can get maybe 20% of the puzzles right). 2. A good resource for openings? I know this isn't the most important thing but I feel like learning the principles behind the opening, what you're trying to achieve, and where you want the pieces to end up would help my positional playing. I've tried some chessable courses on the Ruy Lopez but they all focus on clusters of sidelines off of one main line which isn't really necessary for a low intermediate player like me.	1.0	t3_1903x6j	reddit

43	Chess Rules Need To Change: My Thesis and Follow Up to My Previous Post	Unknown	2024-01-06 18:11:37	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/19062it/chess_rules_need_to_change_my_thesis_and_follow/	"So I made a post today and I don't think anyone actually read my comments in there, and are just repeating the same thing over and over while failing to see the question from my angle. Not helpful. For that reason I am getting rid of the image of the hypothetical position to help you to read my thoughts. So let me try to explain better: Part 1: Ok. First, I want you to drop everything you know about the rules and think about this conceptually. Approach this as if you are making the rules, imagine you are developing the game and need to create these rules. First guiding questions: **1. What is check?** Check is when your king is in danger of being captured on the next move. Can we agree to this? **2. Absolute pins** Black cannot move his rook due to the absolute pin, this would be an illegal move. Right? Can we all agree that the rules say you cannot move a piece if that means your king is put in check. Moving a piece out of an absolute pin is not allowed. Ok now that we have established black cannot move his rook because that would be an illegal move, does that mean my king is in check? Or in other words, if the move that captures my king is illegal and cannot be played, does that mean my king is in danger? I say no under the rules of chess that we have today. Since black cannot legally move his rook on the next move, that means my king is not in danger of being captured on the next move. Therefore, my king is not in check. I encourage you to take a minute and think about that. I feel like people just looked at the picture and went ""yes"" because they think of how the rules are and now how they are conceptually. And I agree, as the rules are now, my king is in check, but it does not make sense is the point I am making. **Another way of putting it:**If the move that would capture your king is an illegal move that cannot be played, is your king actually in check? It is paradoxical, because the move that that makes you king in danger is illegal and cannot be played, but you're in check because your king could be captured...but it cant be captured because the piece cant move to capture your king. It makes no sense to me. Now part 2 of my post and why I think the rules need to change: I think in chess you should be able to ignore checks and capture kings as a means to end the game. Obviously if you ignore check then you lose on the next move. Why? Because it fixes this paradox. If black could ignore an absolute pin then yes, my king is in danger. But as the rules stands right now, if black were to move his rook to capture my king...well that is illegal since he put his own king in check. For this reason I think we need to reevaluate the rules to allow king captures and the ability to ignore checks. Under that circumstance, then yes, my king is actually in danger of being captured. Ok now that you‚Äôve read the point I‚Äôm trying to make, [here](https://imgur.com/a/5HoFmuo) is the image of the hypothetical position I am referring to. Now obviously white just captures the rook with check and it‚Äôs a draw. But think what would happen if that bishop was doing something else too at the time and it wouldn‚Äôt be beneficial to capture the rook. Again this is hypothetical, and this position is simplified down to illustrate my point."	3.0	t3_19062it	reddit

47	Can the game of chess have similarities to overtraining in physical exercise, if done too often? I felt mentally exhausted a while back.	Unknown	2024-01-06 08:06:53	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18zv41h/can_the_game_of_chess_have_similarities_to/	I've noticed if I play chess really often i.e. 8-12 games a day on chess.com for weeks on end or more, I burn out. I recently went on a 189 day streak and then I started losing and losing badly. I did really well in the beginning, mellowed out and stagnated in the middle, then plummeted. After not playing for a month because I got fed up with it, I came back and played a game. Then the winning streaks returned and I went up to 1300 when I ended at like 1050 (I lost a lot of games...). This reminds me of overtraining in sports. I can't run long distances 7 days a week as that will prevent healing from injuries and allowing the body time to rest and build muscle. I can't benchpress everyday because that'll just lead to torn muscles, injuries, and a sharp decline in strength. Could the sme be told for chess or did I just hit a skill wall in the match making?

Unknown	2024-01-06 09:31:59	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18zwd1v/chess_puzzle_for_scavenger_hunt_does_it_make_sense/	Dear chess community, I need your help. I want to create a puzzle for my chess-loving friend but I've never played chess. ChatGPT has helped me, can you check if the puzzle makes sense? (Please don't care about language, it will be in another language anyway.) Also, how could I get a 4-digit-code in the end? A king ruled over the magical land of [city] whose destiny was determined by the pieces on an ancient chessboard. His queen, a noble and wise woman, proudly sat by his side. However, the kingdom was in danger, and the king called his loyal horse-riding knights to gather and protect the land. The knights, with their shiny armor, stood ready to fend off attacks from enemy pieces. Yet, tall towers, proud and majestic, formed the defensive line. Only with the correct positioning of the soldiers could the kingdom be saved. The story contains the keys to position the chess pieces on the board. Pay attention to the hierarchy and roles of the pieces to discover the magical pattern that opens the doors to the next puzzle. Solution: The king ruled over the land - Place the white king on the square e1. The queen, a noble and wise woman, proudly sat by his side - Place the white queen on the square d1. The loyal knights on horseback - Place the white knights on squares b1 and g1. Tall towers, proud and majestic, formed the defensive line - Place the white rooks on squares a1 and h1. The soldiers, ready to fend off attacks from enemy pieces - Place the white pawns on squares a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2.	2.0	t3_18zwd1v	reddit

79	Are people developing deeper theory for moves like 1a/h4/3, or ..a/h5/6, due to Magnus and Hikaru?	~1300 FIDE	2024-01-04 20:56:13	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18ynp1f/are_people_developing_deeper_theory_for_moves/	"When Magnus and Hikaru play online blitz, they often like to play ""ridiculous"" first moves, such as starting with a flank pawn push (a or h, 3, 4, 5, or 6). Often this pays off greatly for them, likely because their opponents don't know the proper moves. I've thus been wondering if the titled Tuesday champions playing like this, has led to someone developing serious theory for these flank pawn pushes? My instinct would be to play principaled in these situations, but with engine analysis there could be better ways to ask the questionable moves what their purposes are. Historically I guess that these moves have not seen much theory, since noone would deign to play them, but most GMs can be fairly certain to see one of these four moves when meeting the top players online, and I guess that would be enough to warrant some theory for the master players? I don't think I've ever seen an opening book or course on these moves, so does anyone know if that has been created recently? I'm not necessarily interested in playing these moves, but if is an area with highly underdeveloped theory, it seems like the perfect place for Carlsen and Hikaru to get openings named after themselves?"	13.0	t3_18ynp1f	reddit

101	On the Impact of Information Technologies on Society: an Historical Perspective through the Game of Chess	Frederic Prost	2012-03-15 18:17:04	http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3434v1	The game of chess as always been viewed as an iconic representation of intellectual prowess. Since the very beginning of computer science, the challenge of being able to program a computer capable of playing chess and beating humans has been alive and used both as a mark to measure hardware/software progresses and as an ongoing programming challenge leading to numerous discoveries. In the early days of computer science it was a topic for specialists. But as computers were democratized, and the strength of chess engines began to increase, chess players started to appropriate to themselves these new tools. We show how these interactions between the world of chess and information technologies have been herald of broader social impacts of information technologies. The game of chess, and more broadly the world of chess (chess players, literature, computer softwares and websites dedicated to chess, etc.), turns out to be a surprisingly and particularly sharp indicator of the changes induced in our everyday life by the information technologies. Moreover, in the same way that chess is a modelization of war that captures the raw features of strategic thinking, chess world can be seen as small society making the study of the information technologies impact easier to analyze and to grasp.			arxiv	[]	1.0

By jointly training the neural chess engine and the generation models for different categories, the models become more effective.

The only difference with respect to the classical variant of Chess-game is that each rook after its having been captured by enemy chess piece in the proccess of gaming is not to be eliminated from the current game, but this rook is assumed being under virtual repairing during next N-steps (the required number of N is discussed in the current research). Then afterwards, such rook will be introduced in game again during maximal N-steps if only the chessboard square (on which it was captured previously) has not been occupied at previous step. In this case, Phoenix-Chess can be classified as game without predictable horizon of planning, so this kind of game should be considered as Chess-like games with incomplete information.			arxiv	['Millana Ershkova']	4.0

This function is pre-trained on the sentiment of commentary associated with the training moves and is used to guide and optimize the agent's game-playing decision making. The contributions of this research are three-fold: we build and put forward both a classifier which extracts commentary describing the quality of Chess moves in vast commentary datasets, and a Sentiment Analysis model trained on Chess commentary to accurately predict the quality of said moves, to then use those predictions to evaluate the optimal next move of a Chess agent. Both classifiers achieve over 90 % classification accuracy. Lastly, we present a Chess engine, SentiMATE, which evaluates Chess moves based on a pre-trained sentiment evaluation function. Our results exhibit strong evidence to support our initial hypothesis - ""Can Natural Language Processing be used to train a novel and sample efficient evaluation function in Chess Engines?"" - as we integrate our evaluation function into modern Chess engines and play against agents with traditional Chess move evaluation functions, beating both random agents and a DeepChess implementation at a level-one search depth - representing the number of moves a traditional Chess agent (employing the alpha-beta search algorithm) looks ahead in order to evaluate a given chess state."			arxiv	['Isaac Bentata Chocron', 'Nicholas McCarthy']	6.0

State-of-the-art engines now provide an authoritative judgement that can be used in many applications like cheating detection, intrinsic ratings computation, skill assessment, or the study of human decision-making. A key issue for the research community is to gather a large dataset of chess games together with the judgement of chess engines. Unfortunately the analysis of each move takes lots of times. In this paper, we report our effort to analyse almost 5 millions chess games with a computing grid. During summer 2015, we processed 270 millions unique played positions using the Stockfish engine with a quite high depth (20). We populated a database of 1+ tera-octets of chess evaluations, representing an estimated time of 50 years of computation on a single machine. Our effort is a first step towards the replication of research results, the supply of open data and procedures for exploring new directions, and the investigation of software engineering/scalability issues when computing billions of moves.			arxiv	['Fran√ßois Esnault']	8.0

It requires entry of moves into a chess engine which is, cumbersome and error prone. We present ARChessAnalyzer, a complete pipeline from live image capture of a physical chess game, to board and piece recognition, to move analysis and finally to Augmented Reality (AR) overlay of the chess diagram position and move on the physical board. ARChessAnalyzer is like a scene analyzer - it uses an ensemble of traditional image and vision techniques to segment the scene (ie the chess game) and uses Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict the segmented pieces and combine it together to analyze the game. This paper advances the state of the art in the first of its kind end to end integration of robust detection and segmentation of the board, chess piece detection using the fine-tuned AlexNet CNN and chess engine analyzer in a handheld device app. The accuracy of the entire chess position prediction pipeline is 93.45\% and takes 3-4.5sec from live capture to AR overlay. We also validated our hypothesis that ARChessAnalyzer, is faster at analysis than manual entry for all board positions for valid outcomes. Our hope is that the instantaneous feedback this app provides will help chess learners worldwide at all levels improve their game.			arxiv	[]	9.0
110	Learning to Play Chess from Textbooks (LEAP): a Corpus for Evaluating Chess Moves based on Sentiment Analysis	Haifa Alrdahi	2023-10-31 08:26:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20260v1	Learning chess strategies has been investigated widely, with most studies focussing on learning from previous games using search algorithms. Chess textbooks encapsulate grandmaster knowledge, explain playing strategies and require a smaller search space compared to traditional chess agents. This paper examines chess textbooks as a new knowledge source for enabling machines to learn how to play chess -- a resource that has not been explored previously. We developed the LEAP corpus, a first and new heterogeneous dataset with structured (chess move notations and board states) and unstructured data (textual descriptions) collected from a chess textbook containing 1164 sentences discussing strategic moves from 91 games. We firstly labelled the sentences based on their relevance, i.e., whether they are discussing a move. Each relevant sentence was then labelled according to its sentiment towards the described move. We performed empirical experiments that assess the performance of various transformer-based baseline models for sentiment analysis. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of employing transformer-based sentiment analysis models for evaluating chess moves, with the best performing model obtaining a weighted micro F_1 score of 68%. Finally, we synthesised the LEAP corpus to create a larger dataset, which can be used as a solution to the limited textual resource in the chess domain.			arxiv	['Riza Batista-Navarro']	10.0

Evans	2013-02-18 18:14:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4377v2	We investigate the transfinite game values arising in infinite chess, providing both upper and lower bounds on the supremum of these values---the omega one of chess---with two senses depending on whether one considers only finite positions or also positions with infinitely many pieces. For lower bounds, we present specific infinite positions with transfinite game values of omega, omega^2, omega^2 times k, and omega^3. By embedding trees into chess, we show that there is a computable infinite chess position that is a win for white if the players are required to play according to a deterministic computable strategy, but which is a draw without that restriction. Finally, we prove that every countable ordinal arises as the game value of a position in infinite three-dimensional chess, and consequently the omega one of infinite three-dimensional chess is as large as it can be, namely, true omega one.			arxiv	['Joel David Hamkins']	12.0

Opening Theory is one of the pillars of chess and requires years of study to be mastered. Here we exploit the ""wisdom of the crowd"" in an online chess platform to answer questions that, traditionally, only chess experts could tackle. We first define the relatedness network of chess openings that quantifies how similar two openings are to play. In this network, we spot communities of nodes corresponding to the most common opening choices and their mutual relationships, information which is hard to obtain from the existing classification of openings. Moreover, we use the relatedness network to forecast the future openings players will start to play and we back-test these predictions, obtaining performances considerably higher than those of a random predictor. Finally, we use the Economic Fitness and Complexity algorithm to measure how difficult to play openings are and how skilled in openings players are. This study not only gives a new perspective on chess analysis but also opens the possibility of suggesting personalized opening recommendations using complex network theory."			arxiv	['Vito DP Servedio']	13.0
113	Chess Pure Strategies are Probably Chaotic	M. Chaves	1998-08-21 19:13:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9808001v1	It is odd that chess grandmasters often disagree in their analysis of positions, sometimes even of simple ones, and that a grandmaster can hold his own against an powerful analytic machine such as Deep Blue. The fact that there must exist pure winning strategies for chess is used to construct a control strategy function. It is then shown that chess strategy is equivalent to an autonomous system of differential equations, and conjectured that the system is chaotic. If true the conjecture would explain the forenamed peculiarities and would also imply that there cannot exist a static evaluator for chess.			arxiv	[]	14.0

In this paper the `Chess-board Extraction by Subtraction and Summation' (ChESS) feature detector, designed to exclusively respond to chess-board vertices, is presented. The method proposed is robust against noise, poor lighting and poor contrast, requires no prior knowledge of the extent of the chess-board pattern, is computationally very efficient, and provides a strength measure of detected features. Such a detector has significant application both in the key field of camera calibration, as well as in Structured Light 3D reconstruction. Evidence is presented showing its robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in comparison to other commonly used detectors both under simulation and in experimental 3D reconstruction of flat plate and cylindrical objects			arxiv	['Joan Lasenby']	16.0
116	Innovation and Nested Preferential Growth in Chess Playing Behavior	Juan I. Perotti	2013-09-02 09:29:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0336v2	Complexity develops via the incorporation of innovative properties. Chess is one of the most complex strategy games, where expert contenders exercise decision making by imitating old games or introducing innovations. In this work, we study innovation in chess by analyzing how different move sequences are played at the population level. It is found that the probability of exploring a new or innovative move decreases as a power law with the frequency of the preceding move sequence. Chess players also exploit already known move sequences according to their frequencies, following a preferential growth mechanism. Furthermore, innovation in chess exhibits Heaps' law suggesting similarities with the process of vocabulary growth. We propose a robust generative mechanism based on nested Yule-Simon preferential growth processes that reproduces the empirical observations. These results, supporting the self-similar nature of innovations in chess are important in the context of decision making in a competitive scenario, and extend the scope of relevant findings recently discovered regarding the emergence of Zipf's law in chess.			arxiv	['Hang-Hyun Jo', 'Ana L.

Without any a priori knowledge, in particular without any knowledge regarding the rules of chess, a deep neural network is trained using a combination of unsupervised pretraining and supervised training. The unsupervised training extracts high level features from a given position, and the supervised training learns to compare two chess positions and select the more favorable one. The training relies entirely on datasets of several million chess games, and no further domain specific knowledge is incorporated. The experiments show that the resulting neural network (referred to as DeepChess) is on a par with state-of-the-art chess playing programs, which have been developed through many years of manual feature selection and tuning. DeepChess is the first end-to-end machine learning-based method that results in a grandmaster-level chess playing performance.			arxiv	['Nathan S. Netanyahu', 'Lior Wolf']	18.0

This work presents the re-implementation of the concept detection methodology applied to AlphaZero in McGrath et al. (2022), by using large, open-source chess models with comparable performance. We obtain results similar to those achieved on AlphaZero, while relying solely on open-source resources. We also present a novel explainable AI (XAI) method, which is guaranteed to highlight exhaustively and exclusively the information used by the explained model. This method generates visual explanations tailored to domains characterised by discrete input spaces, as is the case for chess. Our presented method has the desirable property of controlling the information flow between any input vector and the given model, which in turn provides strict guarantees regarding what information is used by the trained model during inference. We demonstrate the viability of our method by applying it to standard 8x8 chess, using large open-source chess models.			arxiv	['Inga Str√ºmke']	19.0

Current approaches use a pipeline of separate, independent, modules such as chessboard detection, square localization, and piece classification. Instead, we follow the deep learning philosophy and explore an end-to-end approach to directly predict the configuration from the image, thus avoiding the error accumulation of the sequential approaches and eliminating the need for intermediate annotations. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset, Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), that consists of 10,800 real photographs and their corresponding annotations. In contrast to existing datasets that are synthetically rendered and have only limited angles, ChessReD has photographs captured from various angles using smartphone cameras; a sensor choice made to ensure real-world applicability. Our approach in chess recognition on the introduced challenging benchmark dataset outperforms related approaches, successfully recognizing the chess pieces' configuration in 15.26% of ChessReD's test images. This accuracy may seem low, but it is ~7x better than the current state-of-the-art and reflects the difficulty of the problem. The code and data are available through: https://github.com/ThanosM97/end-to-end-chess-recognition.			arxiv	['Jan van Gemert']	20.0
120	Assessing Game Balance with AlphaZero: Exploring Alternative Rule Sets in Chess	Nenad Toma≈°ev	2020-09-09 15:49:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04374v2	It is non-trivial to design engaging and balanced sets of game rules. Modern chess has evolved over centuries, but without a similar recourse to history, the consequences of rule changes to game dynamics are difficult to predict. AlphaZero provides an alternative in silico means of game balance assessment. It is a system that can learn near-optimal strategies for any rule set from scratch, without any human supervision, by continually learning from its own experience. In this study we use AlphaZero to creatively explore and design new chess variants. There is growing interest in chess variants like Fischer Random Chess, because of classical chess's voluminous opening theory, the high percentage of draws in professional play, and the non-negligible number of games that end while both players are still in their home preparation. We compare nine other variants that involve atomic changes to the rules of chess. The changes allow for novel strategic and tactical patterns to emerge, while keeping the games close to the original. By learning near-optimal strategies for each variant with AlphaZero, we determine what games between strong human players might look like if these variants were adopted. Qualitatively, several variants are very dynamic. An analytic comparison show that pieces are valued differently between variants, and that some variants are more decisive than classical chess. Our findings demonstrate the rich possibilities that lie beyond the rules of modern chess.			arxiv	['Ulrich Paquet', 'Demis Hassabis', 'Vladimir Kramnik']	21.0

Generalizing a known result on so-called Richman games, we show that for a natural class of games including bidding chess, each position can be assigned rational upper and lower values corresponding to the limit proportion of money that Black (say) needs in order to force a win and to avoid losing, respectively. We have computed these values for all three-piece endgames, and in all cases, the upper and lower values coincide. Already with three pieces, the game is quite complex, and the values have denominators of up to 138 digits.			arxiv	['Johan W√§stlund']	30.0

The reflexmate is a derivative of the selfmate in which White compels Black to checkmate with the added condition that if either player can checkmate, they must do that (when this condition applies only to Black, it is a semi-reflexmate). We slightly modify the reduction of EXPTIME-hardness of Chess and apply the reduction to these Chess problems. It is proved that selfmate, reflexmate, and semi-reflexmate are all EXPTIME-complete.			arxiv	[]	32.0

However, the rules for playing it are rather complex since there are different types of pieces and the ways they are allowed to move depend upon the type of the piece. In this paper we discuss alternative paradigms that can be used for modelling the rule of the chess game using VDM++ and show what we believe is the best model. It is also illustrated how this model can be connected to a standard textual notation for the moves in a chess game. This can be used to combine the formal model to a more convenient interface.			arxiv	['Peter Gorm Larsen']	33.0
132	The Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate: A New Approach to Computational Creativity	Azlan Iqbal	2015-07-25 03:00:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07058v2	We introduce a new artificial intelligence (AI) approach called, the 'Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate' (DSNS). It uses selected attributes from objects in various domains (e.g. chess problems, classical music, renowned artworks) and recombines them in such a way as to generate new attributes that can then, in principle, be used to create novel objects of creative value to humans relating to any one of the source domains. This allows some of the burden of creative content generation to be passed from humans to machines. The approach was tested in the domain of chess problem composition. We used it to automatically compose numerous sets of chess problems based on attributes extracted and recombined from chess problems and tournament games by humans, renowned paintings, computer-evolved abstract art, photographs of people, and classical music tracks. The quality of these generated chess problems was then assessed automatically using an existing and experimentally-validated computational chess aesthetics model. They were also assessed by human experts in the domain. The results suggest that attributes collected and recombined from chess and other domains using the DSNS approach can indeed be used to automatically generate chess problems of reasonably high aesthetic quality. In particular, a low quality chess source (i.e. tournament game sequences between weak players) used in combination with actual photographs of people was able to produce three-move chess problems of comparable quality or better to those generated using a high quality chess source (i.e. published compositions by human experts), and more efficiently as well. Why information from a foreign domain can be integrated and functional in this way remains an open question for now. The DSNS approach is, in principle, scalable and applicable to any domain in which objects have attributes that can be represented using real numbers.			arxiv	['Matej Guid', 'Simon Colton', 'Jana Krivec', 'Shazril Azman', 'Boshra Haghighi']	34.0

The visual attention model described in this article has been created to generate saliency maps that capture hierarchical and spatial features of chessboard, in order to predict the probability fixation for individual pixels Using a skip-layer architecture of an autoencoder, with a unified decoder, we are able to use multiscale features to predict saliency of part of the board at different scales, showing multiple relations between pieces. We have used scan path and fixation data from players engaged in solving chess problems, to compute 6600 saliency maps associated to the corresponding chess piece configurations. This corpus is completed with synthetically generated data from actual games gathered from an online chess platform. Experiments realized using both scan-paths from chess players and the CAT2000 saliency dataset of natural images, highlights several results. Deep features, pretrained on natural images, were found to be helpful in training visual attention prediction for chess. The proposed neural network architecture is able to generate meaningful saliency maps on unseen chess configurations with good scores on standard metrics. This work provides a baseline for future work on visual attention prediction in similar contexts.			arxiv	['Thomas Guntz', 'James Crowley', 'Dominique Vaufreydaz']	35.0

135	Comparing Typical Opening Move Choices Made by Humans and Chess Engines	Mark Levene	2006-10-11 10:26:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0610060v1	The opening book is an important component of a chess engine, and thus computer chess programmers have been developing automated methods to improve the quality of their books. For chess, which has a very rich opening theory, large databases of high-quality games can be used as the basis of an opening book, from which statistics relating to move choices from given positions can be collected. In order to find out whether the opening books used by modern chess engines in machine versus machine competitions are ``comparable'' to those used by chess players in human versus human competitions, we carried out analysis on 26 test positions using statistics from two opening books one compiled from humans' games and the other from machines' games. Our analysis using several nonparametric measures, shows that, overall, there is a strong association between humans' and machines' choices of opening moves when using a book to guide their choices.			arxiv	['Judit Bar-Ilan']	37.0

Unlike previous attempts using machine learning only to perform parameter-tuning on hand-crafted evaluation functions, Giraffe's learning system also performs automatic feature extraction and pattern recognition. The trained evaluation function performs comparably to the evaluation functions of state-of-the-art chess engines - all of which containing thousands of lines of carefully hand-crafted pattern recognizers, tuned over many years by both computer chess experts and human chess masters. Giraffe is the most successful attempt thus far at using end-to-end machine learning to play chess.			arxiv	[]	39.0
138	Complexity of Retrograde and Helpmate Chess Problems: Even Cooperative Chess is Hard	Josh Brunner	2020-10-19 07:32:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09271v1	"We prove PSPACE-completeness of two classic types of Chess problems when generalized to n-by-n boards. A ""retrograde"" problem asks whether it is possible for a position to be reached from a natural starting position, i.e., whether the position is ""valid"" or ""legal"" or ""reachable"". Most real-world retrograde Chess problems ask for the last few moves of such a sequence; we analyze the decision question which gets at the existence of an exponentially long move sequence. A ""helpmate"" problem asks whether it is possible for a player to become checkmated by any sequence of moves from a given position. A helpmate problem is essentially a cooperative form of Chess, where both players work together to cause a particular player to win; it also arises in regular Chess games, where a player who runs out of time (flags) loses only if they could ever possibly be checkmated from the current position (i.e., the helpmate problem has a solution). Our PSPACE-hardness reductions are from a variant of a puzzle game called Subway Shuffle."			arxiv	['Erik D. Demaine', 'Dylan Hendrickson', 'Julian Wellman']	40.0
139	Intransitively winning chess players positions	Alexander Poddiakov	2022-12-11 05:55:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11069v1	Positions of chess players in intransitive (rock-paper-scissors) relations are considered. Namely, position A of White is preferable (it should be chosen if choice is possible) to position B of Black, position B of Black is preferable to position C of White, position C of White is preferable to position D of Black, but position D of Black is preferable to position A of White. Intransitivity of winningness of positions of chess players is considered to be a consequence of complexity of the chess environment -- in contrast with simpler games with transitive positions only. The space of relations between winningness of positions of chess players is non-Euclidean. The Zermelo-von Neumann theorem is complemented by statements about possibility vs. impossibility of building pure winning strategies based on the assumption of transitivity of positions of chess players. Questions about the possibility of intransitive positions of players in other positional games are raised.			arxiv	[]	41.0
140	The mate-in-n problem of infinite chess is decidable	Dan Brumleve	2012-01-26 18:26:57	http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5597v4	Infinite chess is chess played on an infinite edgeless chessboard. The familiar chess pieces move about according to their usual chess rules, and each player strives to place the opposing king into checkmate. The mate-in-n problem of infinite chess is the problem of determining whether a designated player can force a win from a given finite position in at most n moves. A naive formulation of this problem leads to assertions of high arithmetic complexity with 2n alternating quantifiers---there is a move for white, such that for every black reply, there is a counter-move for white, and so on. In such a formulation, the problem does not appear to be decidable; and one cannot expect to search an infinitely branching game tree even to finite depth. Nevertheless, the main theorem of this article, confirming a conjecture of the first author and C. D. A. Evans, establishes that the mate-in-n problem of infinite chess is computably decidable, uniformly in the position and in n. Furthermore, there is a computable strategy for optimal play from such mate-in-n positions. The proof proceeds by showing that the mate-in-n problem is expressible in what we call the first-order structure of chess, which we prove (in the relevant fragment) is an automatic structure, whose theory is therefore decidable. Indeed, it is definable in Presburger arithmetic. Unfortunately, this resolution of the mate-in-n problem does not appear to settle the decidability of the more general winning-position problem, the problem of determining whether a designated player has a winning strategy from a given position, since a position may admit a winning strategy without any bound on the number of moves required. This issue is connected with transfinite game values in infinite chess, and the exact value of the omega one of chess is not known.			arxiv	['Joel David Hamkins', 'Philipp Schlicht']	42.0
141	Measuring the Non-Transitivity in Chess	Ricky Sanjaya	2021-10-22 12:15:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11737v1	It has long been believed that Chess is the \emph{Drosophila} of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Studying Chess can productively provide valid knowledge about complex systems. Although remarkable progress has been made on solving Chess, the geometrical landscape of Chess in the strategy space is still mysterious. Judging on AI-generated strategies, researchers hypothesised that the strategy space of Chess possesses a spinning top geometry, with the upright axis representing the \emph{transitive} dimension (e.g., A beats B, B beats C, A beats C), and the radial axis representing the \emph{non-transitive} dimension (e.g., A beats B, B beats C, C beats A). However, it is unclear whether such a hypothesis holds for real-world strategies. In this paper, we quantify the non-transitivity in Chess through real-world data from human players. Specifically, we performed two ways of non-transitivity quantifications -- Nash Clustering and counting the number of Rock-Paper-Scissor cycles -- on over one billion match data from Lichess and FICS. Our findings positively indicate that the strategy space occupied by real-world Chess strategies demonstrates a spinning top geometry, and more importantly, there exists a strong connection between the degree of non-transitivity and the progression of a Chess player's rating. In particular, high degrees of non-transitivity tend to prevent human players from making progress on their Elo rating, whereas progressions are easier to make at the level of ratings where the degree of non-transitivity is lower. Additionally, we also investigate the implication of the degree of non-transitivity for population-based training methods. By considering \emph{fixed-memory Fictitious Play} as a proxy, we reach the conclusion that maintaining large-size and diverse populations of strategies is imperative to training effective AI agents in solving Chess types of games.			arxiv	['Jun Wang', 'Yaodong Yang']	43.0
142	Determining Chess Game State From an Image	Georg W√∂lflein	2021-04-30 13:02:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14963v2	Identifying the configuration of chess pieces from an image of a chessboard is a problem in computer vision that has not yet been solved accurately. However, it is important for helping amateur chess players improve their games by facilitating automatic computer analysis without the overhead of manually entering the pieces. Current approaches are limited by the lack of large datasets and are not designed to adapt to unseen chess sets. This paper puts forth a new dataset synthesised from a 3D model that is an order of magnitude larger than existing ones. Trained on this dataset, a novel end-to-end chess recognition system is presented that combines traditional computer vision techniques with deep learning. It localises the chessboard using a RANSAC-based algorithm that computes a projective transformation of the board onto a regular grid. Using two convolutional neural networks, it then predicts an occupancy mask for the squares in the warped image and finally classifies the pieces. The described system achieves an error rate of 0.23% per square on the test set, 28 times better than the current state of the art. Further, a few-shot transfer learning approach is developed that is able to adapt the inference system to a previously unseen chess set using just two photos of the starting position, obtaining a per-square accuracy of 99.83% on images of that new chess set. The code, dataset, and trained models are made available online.			arxiv	['Ognjen Arandjeloviƒá']	44.0
143	Fairer Chess: A Reversal of Two Opening Moves in Chess Creates Balance Between White and Black	Steven J. Brams	2021-08-05 12:14:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02547v2	Unlike tic-tac-toe or checkers, in which optimal play leads to a draw, it is not known whether optimal play in chess ends in a win for White, a win for Black, or a draw. But after White moves first in chess, if Black has a double move followed by a double move of White and then alternating play, play is more balanced because White does not always tie or lead in moves. Symbolically, Balanced Alternation gives the following move sequence: After White's (W) initial move, first Black (B) and then White each have two moves in a row (BBWW), followed by the alternating sequence, beginning with W, which altogether can be written as WB/BW/WB/WB/WB... (the slashes separate alternating pairs of moves). Except for reversal of the 3rd and 4th moves from WB to BW, this is the standard chess sequence. Because Balanced Alternation lies between the standard sequence, which favors White, and a comparable sequence that favors Black, it is highly likely to produce a draw with optimal play, rendering chess fairer. This conclusion is supported by a computer analysis of chess openings and how they would play out under Balanced Alternation.			arxiv	['Mehmet S. Ismail']	45.0

This book gives a complete introduction into the technical inner workings of such engines. The book is split into four main chapters -- excluding chapter 1 (introduction) and chapter 6 (conclusion): Chapter 2 introduces neural networks and covers all the basic building blocks that are used to build deep networks such as those used by AlphaZero. Contents include the perceptron, back-propagation and gradient descent, classification, regression, multilayer perceptron, vectorization techniques, convolutional networks, squeeze and excitation networks, fully connected networks, batch normalization and rectified linear units, residual layers, overfitting and underfitting. Chapter 3 introduces classical search techniques used for chess engines as well as those used by AlphaZero. Contents include minimax, alpha-beta search, and Monte Carlo tree search. Chapter 4 shows how modern chess engines are designed. Aside from the ground-breaking AlphaGo, AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero we cover Leela Chess Zero, Fat Fritz, Fat Fritz 2 and Efficiently Updatable Neural Networks (NNUE) as well as Maia. Chapter 5 is about implementing a miniaturized AlphaZero. Hexapawn, a minimalistic version of chess, is used as an example for that. Hexapawn is solved by minimax search and training positions for supervised learning are generated. Then as a comparison, an AlphaZero-like training loop is implemented where training is done via self-play combined with reinforcement learning. Finally, AlphaZero-like training and supervised training are compared.			arxiv	[]	46.0
145	A New Approach to Draw Detection by Move Repetition in Computer Chess Programming	Vladan Vuckovic	2004-06-21 13:42:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0406038v1	We will try to tackle both the theoretical and practical aspects of a very important problem in chess programming as stated in the title of this article - the issue of draw detection by move repetition. The standard approach that has so far been employed in most chess programs is based on utilising positional matrices in original and compressed format as well as on the implementation of the so-called bitboard format. The new approach that we will be trying to introduce is based on using variant strings generated by the search algorithm (searcher) during the tree expansion in decision making. We hope to prove that this approach is more efficient than the standard treatment of the issue, especially in positions with few pieces (endgames). To illustrate what we have in mind a machine language routine that implements our theoretical assumptions is attached. The routine is part of the Axon chess program, developed by the authors. Axon, in its current incarnation, plays chess at master strength (ca. 2400-2450 Elo, based on both Axon vs computer programs and Axon vs human masters in over 3000 games altogether).			arxiv	['Djordje Vidanovic']	47.0
146	New directions in enumerative chess problems	Noam D. Elkies	2005-08-31 15:31:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0508645v1	Normally a chess problem must have a unique solution, and is deemed unsound even if there are alternatives that differ only in the order in which the same moves are played. In an enumerative chess problem, the set of moves in the solution is (usually) unique but the order is not, and the task is to count the feasible permutations via an isomorphic problem in enumerative combinatorics. Almost all enumerative chess problems have been ``series-movers'', in which one side plays an uninterrupted series of moves, unanswered except possibly for one move by the opponent at the end. This can be convenient for setting up enumeration problems, but we show that other problem genres also lend themselves to composing enumerative problems. Some of the resulting enumerations cannot be shown (or have not yet been shown) in series-movers. This article is based on a presentation given at the banquet in honor of Richard Stanley's 60th birthday, and is dedicated to Stanley on this occasion.			arxiv	[]	48.0
147	Chess, Chance and Conspiracy	Mark R. Segal	2007-08-29 14:06:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.3961v1	Chess and chance are seemingly strange bedfellows. Luck and/or randomness have no apparent role in move selection when the game is played at the highest levels. However, when competition is at the ultimate level, that of the World Chess Championship (WCC), chess and conspiracy are not strange bedfellows, there being a long and colorful history of accusations levied between participants. One such accusation, frequently repeated, was that all the games in the 1985 WCC (Karpov vs Kasparov) were fixed and prearranged move by move. That this claim was advanced by a former World Champion, Bobby Fischer, argues that it ought be investigated. That the only published, concrete basis for this claim consists of an observed run of particular moves, allows this investigation to be performed using probabilistic and statistical methods. In particular, we employ imbedded finite Markov chains to evaluate run statistic distributions. Further, we demonstrate how both chess computers and game data bases can be brought to bear on the problem.			arxiv	[]	49.0

Playing chess is one such task. It was one of the first games which was `solved' using AI. With the advent of deep learning, chess playing agents can surpass human ability with relative ease. However algorithms using deep learning must learn millions of parameters. This work looks at the game of chess through the lens of genetic algorithms. We train a genetic player from scratch using only a handful of learnable parameters. We use Multi-Niche Crowding to optimize positional Value Tables (PVTs) which are used extensively in chess engines to evaluate the goodness of a position.

The library is based on a flexible and efficient expansion in terms of Chebyshev polynomials and presently features the calculation of the density matrix, the calculation of matrix powers for arbitrary powers, and the extraction of eigenvalues in a selected interval. CheSS is able to exploit the sparsity of the matrices and scales linearly with respect to the number of nonzero entries, making it well-suited for large-scale calculations. The approach is particularly adapted for setups leading to small spectral widths of the involved matrices and outperforms alternative methods in this regime. By coupling CheSS to the DFT code BigDFT, we show that such a favorable setup is indeed possible in practice. In addition, the approach based on Chebyshev polynomials can be massively parallelized, and CheSS exhibits excellent scaling up to thousands of cores even for relatively small matrix sizes."			arxiv	['William Dawson', 'Michael Wagner', 'Damien Caliste', 'Takahito Nakajima', 'Luigi Genovese']	51.0

151	Are Chess Discussions Racist? An Adversarial Hate Speech Data Set	Rupak Sarkar	2020-11-20 08:50:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10280v1	"On June 28, 2020, while presenting a chess podcast on Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura, Antonio Radi\'c's YouTube handle got blocked because it contained ""harmful and dangerous"" content. YouTube did not give further specific reason, and the channel got reinstated within 24 hours. However, Radi\'c speculated that given the current political situation, a referral to ""black against white"", albeit in the context of chess, earned him this temporary ban. In this paper, via a substantial corpus of 681,995 comments, on 8,818 YouTube videos hosted by five highly popular chess-focused YouTube channels, we ask the following research question: \emph{how robust are off-the-shelf hate-speech classifiers to out-of-domain adversarial examples?} We release a data set of 1,000 annotated comments where existing hate speech classifiers misclassified benign chess discussions as hate speech. We conclude with an intriguing analogy result on racial bias with our findings pointing out to the broader challenge of color polysemy."			arxiv	['Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh']	53.0

This problem is of much interest for tournament organizers and amateur or professional players to broadcast their over-the-board (OTB) games online or analyze them using chess engines. Previous work has shown promising results, but the recognition accuracy and the latency of state-of-the-art techniques still need further enhancements to allow their practical and affordable deployment. We have investigated how to implement them on an Nvidia Jetson Nano single-board computer effectively. Our first contribution has been accelerating the chessboard's detection algorithm. Subsequently, we have analyzed different Convolutional Neural Networks for chess piece classification and how to map them efficiently on our embedded platform. Notably, we have implemented a functional framework that automatically digitizes a chess position from an image in less than 1 second, with 92% accuracy when classifying the pieces and 95% when detecting the board.			arxiv	['Alberto Antonio del Barrio Garc√≠a', 'Manuel Prieto Mat√≠as']	54.0
153	Complexity of Solo Chess with Unlimited Moves	Josh Brunner	2023-02-02 20:40:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01405v1	We analyze Solo Chess puzzles, where the input is an $n \times n$ board containing some standard Chess pieces of the same color, and the goal is to make a sequence of capture moves to reduce down to a single piece. Prior work analyzes this puzzle for a single piece type when each piece is limited to make at most two capture moves (as in the Solo Chess puzzles on chess.com). By contrast, we study when each piece can make an unlimited number of capture moves. We show that any single piece type can be solved in polynomial time in a general model of piece types, while any two standard Chess piece types are NP-complete. We also analyze the restriction (as on chess.com) that one piece type is unique and must be the last surviving piece, showing that in this case some pairs of piece types become tractable while others remain hard.			arxiv	['Lily Chung', 'Michael Coulombe', 'Erik D.

The paper suggests that pairwise comparison matrices perform well in similar ranking problems. Some features of the proposed method are illustrated by the results of the 18th European Team Chess Championship.

This paper proposes a possibly practical means of using machine learning to create two classes of narrow AI oracles that would provide chess advice: those aligned with the player's interest, and those that want the player to lose and give deceptively bad advice. The player would be uncertain which type of oracle it was interacting with. As the oracles would be vastly more intelligent than the player in the domain of chess, experience with these oracles might help us prepare for future artificial general intelligence oracles.			arxiv	['Roman Yampolskiy', 'Olle Haggstrom', 'Stuart Armstrong']	59.0

This is motivated by a chess problem. In an enumerative chess problem, the set of moves in the solution is (usually) unique, but the order is not. The task of counting the feasible permutations may be accomplished by solving an equivalent problem in enumerative combinatorics. Almost all such problems have been of a special type known as series movers. In this thesis we use generalized hypergeometric functions to enumerate SYT of battery shapes, and thus solve a chess problem posed by Buchanan.			arxiv	[]	60.0

159	A Popperian Falsification of Artificial Intelligence -- Lighthill Defended	Steven Meyer	2017-04-23 21:16:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08111v3	The area of computation called artificial intelligence (AI) is falsified by describing a previous 1972 falsification of AI by British mathematical physicist James Lighthill. How Lighthill's arguments continue to apply to current AI is explained. It is argued that AI should use the Popperian scientific method in which it is the duty of scientists to attempt to falsify theories and if theories are falsified to replace or modify them. The paper describes the Popperian method and discusses Paul Nurse's application of the method to cell biology that also involves questions of mechanism and behavior. It is shown how Lighthill's falsifying arguments especially combinatorial explosion continue to apply to modern AI. Various skeptical arguments against the assumptions of AI mostly by physicists especially against Hilbert's philosophical programme that defined knowledge and truth as provable formal sentences. John von Neumann's arguments from natural complexity against neural networks and evolutionary algorithms are discussed. Next the game of chess is discussed to show how modern chess experts have reacted to computer chess programs. It is shown that currently chess masters can defeat any chess program using Kasperov's arguments from his 1997 Deep Blue match and aftermath. The game of 'go' and climate models are discussed to show computer applications where combinatorial explosion may not apply. The paper concludes by advocating studying computation as Peter Naur's Dataology.			arxiv	[]	62.0
160	Chess is hard even for a single player	N. R. Aravind	2022-03-28 16:13:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14864v2	"We introduce a generalization of ""Solo Chess"", a single-player variant of the game that can be played on chess.com. The standard version of the game is played on a regular 8 x 8 chessboard by a single player, with only white pieces, using the following rules: every move must capture a piece, no piece may capture more than 2 times, and if there is a King on the board, it must be the final piece. The goal is to clear the board, i.e, make a sequence of captures after which only one piece is left. We generalize this game to unbounded boards with $n$ pieces, each of which have a given number of captures that they are permitted to make. We show that Generalized Solo Chess is NP-complete, even when it is played by only rooks that have at most two captures remaining. It also turns out to be NP-complete even when every piece is a queen with exactly two captures remaining in the initial configuration. In contrast, we show that solvable instances of Generalized Solo Chess can be completely characterized when the game is: a) played by rooks on a one-dimensional board, and b) played by pawns with two captures left on a 2D board. Inspired by Generalized Solo Chess, we also introduce the Graph Capture Game, which involves clearing a graph of tokens via captures along edges. This game subsumes Generalized Solo Chess played by knights. We show that the Graph Capture Game is NP-complete for undirected graphs and DAGs."			arxiv	['Neeldhara Misra', 'Harshil Mittal']	63.0
161	AI-powered mechanisms as judges: Breaking ties in chess and beyond	Nejat Anbarci	2022-10-15 13:27:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08289v2	Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology use has been rising in sports. For example, to reduce staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, major tennis tournaments replaced human line judges with Hawk-Eye Live technology. AI is now ready to move beyond such mundane tasks, however. A case in point and a perfect application ground is chess. To reduce the growing incidence of draws, many elite tournaments have resorted to fast chess tiebreakers. However, these tiebreakers are vulnerable to strategic manipulation, e.g., in the last game of the 2018 World Chess Championship, Magnus Carlsen -- in a significantly advantageous position -- offered a draw to Fabiano Caruana (whom accepted the offer) to proceed to fast chess tiebreaks in which Carlsen had even better odds of winning the championship. By contrast, we prove that our AI-based method can serve as a judge to break ties without being vulnerable to such manipulation. It relies on measuring the difference between the evaluations of a player's actual move and the best move as deemed by a powerful chess engine. If there is a tie, the player with the higher quality measure wins the tiebreak. We generalize our method to all competitive sports and games in which AI's superiority is -- or can be -- established.			arxiv	['Mehmet S. Ismail']	64.0
162	Cultural transmission of move choice in chess	Egor Lappo	2023-02-21 00:25:41	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10375v3	The study of cultural evolution benefits from detailed analysis of cultural transmission in specific human domains. Chess provides a platform for understanding the transmission of knowledge due to its active community of players, precise behaviors, and long-term records of high-quality data. In this paper, we perform an analysis of chess in the context of cultural evolution, describing multiple cultural factors that affect move choice. We then build a population-level statistical model of move choice in chess, based on the Dirichlet-multinomial likelihood, to analyze cultural transmission over decades of recorded games played by leading players. For moves made in specific positions, we evaluate the relative effects of frequency-dependent bias, success bias, and prestige bias on the dynamics of move frequencies. We observe that negative frequency-dependent bias plays a role in the dynamics of certain moves, and that other moves are compatible with transmission under prestige bias or success bias. These apparent biases may reflect recent changes, namely the introduction of computer chess engines and online tournament broadcasts. Our analysis of chess provides insights into broader questions concerning how social learning biases affect cultural evolution.			arxiv	['Noah A. Rosenberg', 'Marcus W. Feldman']	65.0

Specifically, using the example of the chess variant known as Switch-Side Chain-Chess (SSCC). Presently, no foolproof method of detecting such chains in any given chess position is known and existing graph theory, to our knowledge, is unable to fully address this problem either. We therefore propose a solution implemented and tested using the C++ programming language. We have been unable to find an incorrect result and therefore offer it as the most viable solution thus far to the chain-detection problem in this chess variant. The algorithm is also scalable, in principle, to areas beyond two-dimensional grids such as 3D analysis and molecular chemistry.			arxiv	['Azlan Iqbal']	69.0
167	Optimal Dimensionality Reduction of Complex Dynamics: The Chess Game as Diffusion on a Free Energy Landscape	Sergei V. Krivov	2011-03-18 18:21:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3681v1	Dimensionality reduction is ubiquitous in analysis of complex dynamics. The conventional dimensionality reduction techniques, however, focus on reproducing the underlying configuration space, rather than the dynamics itself. The constructed low-dimensional space does not provide complete and accurate description of the dynamics. Here I describe how to perform dimensionality reduction while preserving the essential properties of the dynamics. The approach is illustrated by analyzing the chess game - the archetype of complex dynamics. A variable that provides complete and accurate description of chess dynamics is constructed. Winning probability is predicted by describing the game as a random walk on the free energy landscape associated with the variable. The approach suggests a possible way of obtaining a simple yet accurate description of many important complex phenomena. The analysis of the chess game shows that the approach can quantitatively describe the dynamics of processes where human decision-making plays a central role, e.g., financial and social dynamics.			arxiv	[]	70.0
168	Estimating Total Search Space Size for Specific Piece Sets in Chess	Azlan Iqbal	2018-02-27 07:35:55	http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00874v1	Automatic chess problem or puzzle composition typically involves generating and testing various different positions, sometimes using particular piece sets. Once a position has been generated, it is then usually tested for positional legality based on the game rules. However, it is useful to be able to estimate what the search space size for particular piece combinations is to begin with. So if a desirable chess problem was successfully generated by examining 'merely' 100,000 or so positions in a theoretical search space of about 100 billion, this would imply the composing approach used was quite viable and perhaps even impressive. In this article, I explain a method of calculating the size of this search space using a combinatorics and permutations approach. While the mathematics itself may already be established, a precise method and justification of applying it with regard to the chessboard and chess pieces has not been documented, to the best of our knowledge. Additionally, the method could serve as a useful starting point for further estimations of search space size which filter out positions for legality and rotation, depending on how the automatic composer is allowed to place pieces on the board (because this affects its total search space size).			arxiv	[]	71.0

Our results show that using an appropriate expert (or mentor), we can evolve a program that is on par with top tournament-playing chess programs, outperforming a two-time World Computer Chess Champion. This performance gain is achieved by evolving a program that mimics the behavior of a superior expert. The resulting evaluation function of the evolved program consists of a much smaller number of parameters than the expert's. The extended experimental results provided in this paper include a report of our successful participation in the 2008 World Computer Chess Championship. In principle, our expert-driven approach could be used in a wide range of problems for which appropriate experts are available.			arxiv	['Moshe Koppel', 'Nathan S. Netanyahu']	72.0

The evaluation function of the program is evolved by learning from databases of (human) grandmaster games. At first, the organisms are evolved to mimic the behavior of human grandmasters, and then these organisms are further improved upon by means of coevolution. The search mechanism is evolved by learning from tactical test suites. Our results show that the evolved program outperforms a two-time world computer chess champion and is at par with the other leading computer chess programs.			arxiv	['H.

This problem represents a greater challenge from a creative standpoint because the checkmate is not always clear and the method of winning even less so. Creating a decisive chess problem of this type without the aid of an omniscient 7-piece endgame tablebase (and one that also abides by several chess composition conventions) would therefore be a challenge for most human players and composers working on their own. The fact that a small computer with relatively low processing power and memory was sufficient to compose such a problem using the DSNS approach in just 10 days is therefore noteworthy. In this report we document the event and result in some detail. It lends additional credence to the DSNS as a viable new approach in the field of computational creativity. In particular, in areas where human-like creativity is required for targeted or specific problems with no clear path to the solution.			arxiv	[]	74.0

The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. In contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go, by tabula rasa reinforcement learning from games of self-play. In this paper, we generalise this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve, tabula rasa, superhuman performance in many challenging domains. Starting from random play, and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case.			arxiv	['Thomas Hubert', 'Julian Schrittwieser', 'Ioannis Antonoglou', 'Matthew Lai', 'Arthur Guez', 'Marc Lanctot', 'Laurent Sifre', 'Dharshan Kumaran', 'Thore Graepel', 'Timothy Lillicrap', 'Karen Simonyan', 'Demis Hassabis']	75.0

However, one common element in these works is the necessity of a finely optimized look ahead algorithm. The particular interest of this research lies with creating a chess engine that is highly capable, but restricted in its look ahead depth. We train a deep neural network to serve as a static evaluation function, which is accompanied by a relatively simple look ahead algorithm. We show that our static evaluation function has encoded some semblance of look ahead knowledge, and is comparable to classical evaluation functions. The strength of our chess engine is assessed by comparing its proposed moves against those proposed by Stockfish. We show that, despite strict restrictions on look ahead depth, our engine recommends moves of equal strength in roughly $83\%$ of our sample positions.			arxiv	[]	77.0
175	The Chess Transformer: Mastering Play using Generative Language Models	David Noever	2020-08-02 18:04:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04057v5	This work demonstrates that natural language transformers can support more generic strategic modeling, particularly for text-archived games. In addition to learning natural language skills, the abstract transformer architecture can generate meaningful moves on a chessboard. With further fine-tuning, the transformer learns complex gameplay by training on 2.8 million chess games in Portable Game Notation. After 30,000 training steps, OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-2) optimizes weights for 774 million parameters. This fine-tuned Chess Transformer generates plausible strategies and displays game formations identifiable as classic openings, such as English or the Slav Exchange. Finally, in live play, the novel model demonstrates a human-to-transformer interface that correctly filters illegal moves and provides a novel method to challenge the transformer's chess strategies. We anticipate future work will build on this transformer's promise, particularly in other strategy games where features can capture the underlying complex rule syntax from simple but expressive player annotations.			arxiv	['Matt Ciolino', 'Josh Kalin']	78.0

On one hand, the decision-making processes need to take into account many options. On the other hand, the design of the system's logical architecture must consider various dependability concerns such as safety, reliability, and security. Moreover, in case of high-assurance systems, the analysis of such concerns must be performed with rigorous methods. In this paper, we present the new development of CHESS, a cross-domain, model-driven, component-based, and open-source tool for the development of high-integrity systems. We focus on the new recently distributed version of CHESS, which supports extended model-based development and analyses for safety and security concerns.

However, the complexity of natural language makes it challenging to ascertain how accurately these models are tracking the world state underlying the text. Motivated by this issue, we consider the task of language modeling for the game of chess. Unlike natural language, chess notations describe a simple, constrained, and deterministic domain. Moreover, we observe that the appropriate choice of chess notation allows for directly probing the world state, without requiring any additional probing-related machinery. We find that: (a) With enough training data, transformer language models can learn to track pieces and predict legal moves with high accuracy when trained solely on move sequences. (b) For small training sets providing access to board state information during training can yield significant improvements. (c) The success of transformer language models is dependent on access to the entire game history i.e. ""full attention"". Approximating this full attention results in a significant performance drop. We propose this testbed as a benchmark for future work on the development and analysis of transformer language models."			arxiv	['Sam Wiseman', 'Karen Livescu', 'Kevin Gimpel']	80.0

We find that they can serve as a tool for testing machine ability as well. Two of the leading chess engines, Stockfish and Leela Chess Zero (LCZero), employ significantly different methods during play. We use Plaskett's Puzzle, a famous endgame study from the late 1970s, to compare the two engines. Our experiments show that Stockfish outperforms LCZero on the puzzle. We examine the algorithmic differences between the engines and use our observations as a basis for carefully interpreting the test results. Drawing inspiration from how humans solve chess problems, we ask whether machines can possess a form of imagination. On the theoretical side, we describe how Bellman's equation may be applied to optimize the probability of winning. To conclude, we discuss the implications of our work on artificial intelligence (AI) and artificial general intelligence (AGI), suggesting possible avenues for future research.			arxiv	['Nick Polson', 'Alex Turk']	81.0

This question is of both scientific and practical interest. If the representations of strong neural networks bear no resemblance to human concepts, our ability to understand faithful explanations of their decisions will be restricted, ultimately limiting what we can achieve with neural network interpretability. In this work we provide evidence that human knowledge is acquired by the AlphaZero neural network as it trains on the game of chess. By probing for a broad range of human chess concepts we show when and where these concepts are represented in the AlphaZero network. We also provide a behavioural analysis focusing on opening play, including qualitative analysis from chess Grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik. Finally, we carry out a preliminary investigation looking at the low-level details of AlphaZero's representations, and make the resulting behavioural and representational analyses available online.			arxiv	['Andrei Kapishnikov', 'Nenad Toma≈°ev', 'Adam Pearce', 'Demis Hassabis', 'Been Kim', 'Ulrich Paquet', 'Vladimir Kramnik']	82.0
180	Chess tableaux, powers of two and affine Lie algebras	Antoine Labelle	2022-11-19 04:26:10	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10584v3	Chess tableaux are a special kind of standard Young tableaux where, in the chessboard coloring of the Young diagram, even numbers always appear in white cells and odd numbers in black cells. If, for $\lambda$ a partition of $n$, $\text{Chess}(\lambda)$ denotes the number of chess tableaux of shape $\lambda$, then Chow, Eriksson and Fan observed that $\displaystyle\sum_{\lambda \vdash n} \text{Chess}(\lambda)^2$ is divisible by unusually large powers of $2$. In this paper, we give an explanation for this phenomenon, proving a lower bound of $n-O(\sqrt{n})$ for the $2$-adic valuation of this sum and a generalization of it. We do this by exploiting a connection with a certain representation of the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}$ on the vector space with basis indexed by partitions. Our result about chess tableaux then follows from a study of the basic representation of $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}$ with coefficients taken from the ring of rational numbers with odd denominators.			arxiv	['Stoyan Dimitrov']	83.0
181	Improving Chess Commentaries by Combining Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning Engines	Andrew Lee	2022-12-15 23:38:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08195v1	Despite many recent advancements in language modeling, state-of-the-art language models lack grounding in the real world and struggle with tasks involving complex reasoning. Meanwhile, advances in the symbolic reasoning capabilities of AI have led to systems that outperform humans in games like chess and Go (Silver et al., 2018). Chess commentary provides an interesting domain for bridging these two fields of research, as it requires reasoning over a complex board state and providing analyses in natural language. In this work we demonstrate how to combine symbolic reasoning engines with controllable language models to generate chess commentaries. We conduct experiments to demonstrate that our approach generates commentaries that are preferred by human judges over previous baselines.			arxiv	['David Wu', 'Emily Dinan', 'Mike Lewis']	84.0
182	CHESS: A Framework for Evaluation of Self-adaptive Systems based on Chaos Engineering	Sehrish Malik	2023-03-13 17:00:55	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07283v1	There is an increasing need to assess the correct behavior of self-adaptive and self-healing systems due to their adoption in critical and highly dynamic environments. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluation methods for self-adaptive and self-healing systems. We proposed CHESS, a novel approach to address this gap by evaluating self-adaptive and self-healing systems through fault injection based on chaos engineering (CE) [ arXiv:2208.13227 ]. The artifact presented in this paper provides an extensive overview of the use of CHESS through two microservice-based case studies: a smart office case study and an existing demo application called Yelb. It comes with a managing system service, a self-monitoring service, as well as five fault injection scenarios covering infrastructure faults and functional faults. Each of these components can be easily extended or replaced to adopt the CHESS approach to a new case study, help explore its promises and limitations, and identify directions for future research.

The rules of the game arise naturally by combining the rules of conventional chess with key quantum-physical effects such as superposition and entanglement. Niel's Chess is recommended for ages 10 and above, to everyone who wishes to play a creative game with historical roots and at the same time gain intuition about the foundational quantum effects that power cutting-edge technologies like quantum computing and quantum communication, which are poised to revolutionise our society in the coming decades.			arxiv	[]	86.0
184	The Value of Chess Squares	Aditya Gupta	2023-07-08 20:17:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05330v2	We propose a neural network-based approach to calculate the value of a chess square-piece combination. Our model takes a triplet (Color, Piece, Square) as an input and calculates a value that measures the advantage/disadvantage of having this piece on this square. Our methods build on recent advances in chess AI, and can accurately assess the worth of positions in a game of chess. The conventional approach assigns fixed values to pieces $(\symking=\infty, \symqueen=9, \symrook=5, \symbishop=3, \symknight=3, \sympawn=1)$. We enhance this analysis by introducing marginal valuations. We use deep Q-learning to estimate the parameters of our model. We demonstrate our method by examining the positioning of Knights and Bishops, and also provide valuable insights into the valuation of pawns. Finally, we conclude by suggesting potential avenues for future research.			arxiv	['Shiva Maharaj', 'Nicholas Polson', 'Vadim Sokolov']	87.0
185	Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Chess960 Result and Develop Opening Themes	Shreyan Deo	2023-10-29 08:54:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18938v1	This work focuses on the analysis of Chess 960, also known as Fischer Random Chess, a variant of traditional chess where the starting positions of the pieces are randomized. The study aims to predict the game outcome using machine learning techniques and develop an opening theme for each starting position. The first part of the analysis utilizes machine learning models to predict the game result based on certain moves in each position. The methodology involves segregating raw data from .pgn files into usable formats and creating datasets comprising approximately 500 games for each starting position. Three machine learning algorithms -- KNN Clustering, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Trees -- have been used to predict the game outcome. To establish an opening theme, the board is divided into five regions: center, white kingside, white queenside, black kingside, and black queenside. The data from games played by top engines in all 960 positions is used to track the movement of pieces in the opening. By analysing the change in the number of pieces in each region at specific moves, the report predicts the region towards which the game is developing. These models provide valuable insights into predicting game outcomes and understanding the opening theme in Chess 960.			arxiv	['Nishchal Dwivedi']	88.0
186	Metric spaces in chess and international chess pieces graph diameters	Marco Rip√†	2023-10-31 17:50:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00016v3	This paper aims to study the graph radii and diameters induced by the $k$-dimensional versions of the well-known six international chess pieces on every finite $\{n \times n \times \dots \times n\} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^k$ lattice since they originate as many interesting metric spaces for any proper pair $(n,k)$. For this purpose, we finally discuss a mathematically consistent generalization of all the planar FIDE chess pieces to an appropriate $k$-dimensional environment, finding (for any $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$) the exact values of the graph radii and diameters of the $k$-rook, $k$-king, $k$-bishop, and the corresponding values for the $3$-queen, $3$-knight, and $3$-pawn. We also provide tight bounds for the graph radii and diameters of the $k$-queen, $k$-knight, and $k$-pawn, holding for any $k \geq 4$.			arxiv	[]	89.0
187	A study of memory effects in a chess database	Ana L. Schaigorodsky	2015-04-09 14:54:37	http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06611v2	A series of recent works studying a database of chronologically sorted chess games --containing 1.4 million games played by humans between 1998 and 2007-- have shown that the popularity distribution of chess game-lines follows a Zipf's law, and that time series inferred from the sequences of those game-lines exhibit long-range memory effects. The presence of Zipf's law together with long-range memory effects was observed in several systems, however, the simultaneous emergence of these two phenomena were always studied separately up to now. In this work, by making use of a variant of the Yule-Simon preferential growth model, introduced by Cattuto et al., we provide an explanation for the simultaneous emergence of Zipf's law and long-range correlations memory effects in a chess database. We find that Cattuto's Model (CM) is able to reproduce both, Zipf's law and the long-range correlations, including size-dependent scaling of the Hurst exponent for the corresponding time series. CM allows an explanation for the simultaneous emergence of these two phenomena via a preferential growth dynamics, including a memory kernel, in the popularity distribution of chess game-lines. This mechanism results in an aging process in the chess game-line choice as the database grows. Moreover, we find burstiness in the activity of subsets of the most active players, although the aggregated activity of the pool of players displays inter-event times without burstiness. We show that CM is not able to produce time series with bursty behavior providing evidence that burstiness is not required for the explanation of the long-range correlation effects in the chess database.			arxiv	['Juan I.

188	An Information Theoretic Analysis of Decision in Computer Chess	Alexandru Godescu	2011-12-09 16:50:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2144v1	The basis of the method proposed in this article is the idea that information is one of the most important factors in strategic decisions, including decisions in computer chess and other strategy games. The model proposed in this article and the algorithm described are based on the idea of a information theoretic basis of decision in strategy games . The model generalizes and provides a mathematical justification for one of the most popular search algorithms used in leading computer chess programs, the fractional ply scheme. However, despite its success in leading computer chess applications, until now few has been published about this method. The article creates a fundamental basis for this method in the axioms of information theory, then derives the principles used in programming the search and describes mathematically the form of the coefficients. One of the most important parameters of the fractional ply search is derived from fundamental principles. Until now this coefficient has been usually handcrafted or determined from intuitive elements or data mining. There is a deep, information theoretical justification for such a parameter. In one way the method proposed is a generalization of previous methods. More important, it shows why the fractional depth ply scheme is so powerful. It is because the algorithm navigates along the lines where the highest information gain is possible. A working and original implementation has been written and tested for this algorithm and is provided in the appendix. The article is essentially self-contained and gives proper background knowledge and references. The assumptions are intuitive and in the direction expected and described intuitively by great champions of chess.			arxiv	[]	91.0
189	Chessboard and chess piece recognition with the support of neural networks	Maciej A. Czyzewski	2017-08-13 12:34:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03898v3	Chessboard and chess piece recognition is a computer vision problem that has not yet been efficiently solved. However, its solution is crucial for many experienced players who wish to compete against AI bots, but also prefer to make decisions based on the analysis of a physical chessboard. It is also important for organizers of chess tournaments who wish to digitize play for online broadcasting or ordinary players who wish to share their gameplay with friends. Typically, such digitization tasks are performed by humans or with the aid of specialized chessboards and pieces. However, neither solution is easy or convenient. To solve this problem, we propose a novel algorithm for digitizing chessboard configurations. We designed a method that is resistant to lighting conditions and the angle at which images are captured, and works correctly with numerous chessboard styles. The proposed algorithm processes pictures iteratively. During each iteration, it executes three major sub-processes: detecting straight lines, finding lattice points, and positioning the chessboard. Finally, we identify all chess pieces and generate a description of the board utilizing standard notation. For each of these steps, we designed our own algorithm that surpasses existing solutions. We support our algorithms by utilizing machine learning techniques whenever possible. The described method performs extraordinarily well and achieves an accuracy over $99.5\%$ for detecting chessboard lattice points (compared to the $74\%$ for the best alternative), $95\%$ (compared to $60\%$ for the best alternative) for positioning the chessboard in an image, and almost $95\%$ for chess piece recognition.			arxiv	['Artur Laskowski', 'Szymon Wasik']	92.0
190	Structure constrained by metadata in networks of chess players	Nahuel Almeira	2017-07-31 14:33:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06694v2	Chess is an emblematic sport that stands out because of its age, popularity and complexity. It has served to study human behavior from the perspective of a wide number of disciplines, from cognitive skills such as memory and learning, to aspects like innovation and decision making. Given that an extensive documentation of chess games played throughout history is available, it is possible to perform detailed and statistically significant studies about this sport. Here we use one of the most extensive chess databases in the world to construct two networks of chess players. One of the networks includes games that were played over-the-board and the other contains games played on the Internet. We study the main topological characteristics of the networks, such as degree distribution and correlations, transitivity and community structure. We complement the structural analysis by incorporating players' level of play as node metadata. Although both networks are topologically different, we show that in both cases players gather in communities according to their expertise and that an emergent rich-club structure, composed by the top-rated players, is also present.			arxiv	['Ana Laura Schaigorodsky', 'Juan Ignacio Perotti', 'Orlando Vito Billoni']	93.0
191	Exploring the Performance of Deep Residual Networks in Crazyhouse Chess	Sun-Yu Gordon Chi	2019-08-25 10:18:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09296v1	Crazyhouse is a chess variant that incorporates all of the classical chess rules, but allows users to drop pieces captured from the opponent as a normal move. Until 2018, all competitive computer engines for this board game made use of an alpha-beta pruning algorithm with a hand-crafted evaluation function for each position. Previous machine learning-based algorithms for just regular chess, such as NeuroChess and Giraffe, took hand-crafted evaluation features as input rather than a raw board representation. More recent projects, such as AlphaZero, reached massive success but required massive computational resources in order to reach its final strength. This paper describes the development of SixtyFour, an engine designed to compete in the chess variant of Crazyhouse with limited hardware. This specific variant poses a multitude of significant challenges due to its large branching factor, state-space complexity, and the multiple move types a player can make. We propose the novel creation of a neural network-based evaluation function for Crazyhouse. More importantly, we evaluate the effectiveness of an ensemble model, which allows the training time and datasets to be easily distributed on regular CPU hardware commodity. Early versions of the network have attained a playing level comparable to a strong amateur on online servers.			arxiv	[]	94.0
192	CHESS: an Innovative Concept for High-Resolution, Far-UV Spectroscopy	Keri Hoadley	2020-08-14 21:19:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06575v1	The space ultraviolet (UV) is a critical astronomical observing window, where a multitude of atomic, ionic, and molecular signatures provide crucial insight into planetary, interstellar, stellar, intergalactic, and extragalactic objects. The next generation of large space telescopes require highly sensitive, moderate-to-high resolution UV spectrograph. However, sensitive observations in the UV are difficult, as UV optical performance and imaging efficiencies have lagged behind counterparts in the visible and infrared regimes. This has historically resulted in simple, low-bounce instruments to increase sensitivity. In this study, we present the design, fabrication, and calibration of a simple, high resolution, high throughput far-UV spectrograph - the Colorado High-resolution Echelle Stellar Spectrograph (CHESS). CHESS is a sounding rocket payload to demonstrate the instrument design for the next-generation UV space telescopes. We present tests and results on the performance of several state-of-the-art diffraction grating and detector technologies for far-UV astronomical applications that were flown aboard the first two iterations of CHESS. The CHESS spectrograph was used to study the atomic-to-molecular transitions within translucent cloud regions in the interstellar medium (ISM) through absorption spectroscopy. The first two flights looked at the sightlines towards alpha Virgo and epsilon Persei, and flight results are presented.			arxiv	['Kevin France', 'Nicholas Nell', 'Robert Kane', 'Brian Fleming', 'Allison Youngblood', 'Matthew Beasley']	95.0
193	Analysis of subsystems with rooks on a chess-board representing a partial Latin square (Part 2.)	B√©la J√≥n√°s	2022-08-12 08:34:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06166v1	A partial Latin square of order $n$ can be represented by a $3$-dimensional chess-board of size $n\times n\times n$ with at most $n^2$ non-attacking rooks. In Latin squares, a subsystem and its most distant mate together have as many rooks as their capacity. That implies a simple capacity condition for the completion of partial Latin squares which is in fact the Cruse's necessary condition for characteristic matrices. Andersen-Hilton proved that, except for certain listed cases, a PLS of order $n$ can be completed if it contains only $n$ symbols. Andersen proved it for $n+1$ symbols, listing the cases to be excluded. Identifying the structures of the chess-board that can be overloaded with $n$ or $n+1$ rooks, it follows that a PLS derived from a chess-board with at most $n+1$ non-attacking rooks can be completed exactly if it satisfies the capacity condition. In a layer of a Latin square, two subsystems of a remote couple are in balance. Thus, a necessary condition for completion of a layer can be formulated, the balance condition. For an LSC, each 1-dimensional subspace of the chess-board contains exactly one rook. Consequently, for the PLSCs derived from partial Latin squares, we examine certain sets of 1-dimensional subspaces because they indicate the number of missing rooks.			arxiv	[]	96.0

From this description it can be shown that some of those problems exhibit chaotic behavior, an important fact in understanding the functioning of the related software. As a relatively simple example, it is shown that chess exhibits chaotic behavior in its configuration space. This implies that static evaluators in chess programs have intrinsic limitations.			arxiv	[]	98.0

Conjecturally these minors are among the cluster variables for coordinate rings of unipotent cells within $\SL_2(\mathcal{L})$. In so doing we compute the Euler characteristic of any generalized flag variety attached to a shape module by counting standard tableaux of requisite shape and parity; alternatively by counting chess tableaux of requisite shape and content.			arxiv	[]	100.0

We consider Gardner's minichess variant in which all pieces are set as in a standard chessboard (from Rook to King). This game has roughly 9x10^{18} legal positions and is comparable in this respect with checkers. We weakly solve this game, that is we prove its game-theoretic value and give a strategy to draw against best play for White and Black sides. Our approach requires surprisingly small computing power. We give a human readable proof. The way the result is obtained is generic and could be generalized to bigger chess settings or to other games.			arxiv	['Frederic Prost']	102.0
