0	Space-state complexity of Korean chess and Chinese chess	Donghwi Park	2015-07-23 07:45:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06401v1	This article describes how to calculate exact space-state complexities of Korean chess and Chinese chess. The state-space complexity (a.k.a. search-space complexity) of a game is defined as the number of legal game positions reachable from the initial position of the game. The number of exact space-state complexities are not known for most of games. However, we calculated actual space-state complexities of Korean chess and Chinese chess.	[]	arxiv	
1	On the Impact of Information Technologies on Society: an Historical Perspective through the Game of Chess	Frederic Prost	2012-03-15 18:17:04	http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3434v1	The game of chess as always been viewed as an iconic representation of intellectual prowess. Since the very beginning of computer science, the challenge of being able to program a computer capable of playing chess and beating humans has been alive and used both as a mark to measure hardware/software progresses and as an ongoing programming challenge leading to numerous discoveries. In the early days of computer science it was a topic for specialists. But as computers were democratized, and the strength of chess engines began to increase, chess players started to appropriate to themselves these new tools. We show how these interactions between the world of chess and information technologies have been herald of broader social impacts of information technologies. The game of chess, and more broadly the world of chess (chess players, literature, computer softwares and websites dedicated to chess, etc.), turns out to be a surprisingly and particularly sharp indicator of the changes induced in our everyday life by the information technologies. Moreover, in the same way that chess is a modelization of war that captures the raw features of strategic thinking, chess world can be seen as small society making the study of the information technologies impact easier to analyze and to grasp.

4	GM Pia Cramling is a Delightful Commentator	Unknown	2024-01-05 18:59:04	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18zeil6/gm_pia_cramling_is_a_delightful_commentator/	Over the past few weeks, I've been watching Pia's commentary of her daughter Anna's games in the Rilton ELO tournament ([VODs here](https://www.youtube.com/@AnnaCramlingExtra/videos)). Maybe this is old news, but this was my first time watching, and she's been a *spectacular* host. I don't remember the last time I've been so engaged in a chess tournament, even though I know very little about Anna. Pia is super engaged and excited, seemingly able to talk endlessly for hours on end, all while smiling. Her passion for the game is infectious and makes me want to play! Sure, part of this is probably that she's commentating games for her daughter, but she's clearly also invested for the love of chess. As for her analysis, as (EDIT for clarity: *I* am) someone who's not the greatest player, her commentary feels like the perfect level of depth for me. She doesn't dumb down her analysis - far from it - but she does take the time to explain aspects of a position that might not be so obvious to me. She goes deep into variations while still keeping tabs on overarching strategic ideas, and helps me get into the mindset of the players. Can we get her commentate some other events? I feel like she'd bring a cool perspective to other tournaments!		reddit	<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x112d80cd0>
5	Automated Chess Commentator Powered by Neural Chess Engine	Hongyu Zang	2019-09-23 15:12:45	http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10413v1	In this paper, we explore a new approach for automated chess commentary generation, which aims to generate chess commentary texts in different categories (e.g., description, comparison, planning, etc.). We introduce a neural chess engine into text generation models to help with encoding boards, predicting moves, and analyzing situations. By jointly training the neural chess engine and the generation models for different categories, the models become more effective. We conduct experiments on 5 categories in a benchmark Chess Commentary dataset and achieve inspiring results in both automatic and human evaluations.	['Zhiwei Yu', 'Xiaojun Wan']	arxiv

Students, reply to or DM the coach of your choice with your skill level and preferred method of contact. This thread is intended for players of certain experience looking to share their experience and mentor a less experienced player. It can be a way to try out your teaching skills and who knows, might lead to one day you becoming a chess coach. **ALL COACHING MUST BE FREE. If anyone who commented here is trying to offer you paid coaching or there are any kind of strings attached to their offer, please [let us know](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/chess).** That includes anyone offering you only one free lesson and further lessons paid. This program is NOT meant as a way to promote paid services.

My endgame is weaker than I‚Äôd like, so I‚Äôm not the best choice for endgame study. Have an annotated game ready for me to review. This way I can look at your thought process and narrow in on your weakness. **Timezone/Schedule:** EST/I‚Äôm available for lessons on weekends.

8	Solitaire Chess is NP-complete	Jens Ma√überg	2015-01-26 14:02:29	http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06398v1	"""Solitaire Chess"" is a logic puzzle published by Thinkfun, that can be seen as a single person version of traditional chess. Given a chess board with some chess pieces of the same color placed on it, the task is to capture all pieces but one using only moves that are allowed in chess. Moreover, in each move one piece has to be captured. We prove that deciding if a given instance of Solitaire Chess is solvable is NP-complete."	[]	arxiv	
9	Phoenix-Chess strategy or revisiting the algorithm for playing in Chess with incomplete information	Sergey Ershkov	2021-07-16 10:04:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05204v4	We present here the new insight or revisiting the algorithm for playing in Chess with incomplete information (which can be recognized by its newly short-name as Phoenix-Chess strategy). The only difference with respect to the classical variant of Chess-game is that each rook after its having been captured by enemy chess piece in the proccess of gaming is not to be eliminated from the current game, but this rook is assumed being under virtual repairing during next N-steps (the required number of N is discussed in the current research). Then afterwards, such rook will be introduced in game again during maximal N-steps if only the chessboard square (on which it was captured previously) has not been occupied at previous step. In this case, Phoenix-Chess can be classified as game without predictable horizon of planning, so this kind of game should be considered as Chess-like games with incomplete information.
