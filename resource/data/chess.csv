6	Could a new PCA (or something like it) succeed in 2024?	Unknown	2024-01-10 13:27:40	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/19389db/could_a_new_pca_or_something_like_it_succeed_in/	"On the latest [Perpetual Chess podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am_XbYKKKAY), host Ben Johnson and GM Patrick Wolff discuss the latest FIDE controversies (the Dvorkovich presidency, the Nepo-Dubov knight dance, etc.) and GM Wolff makes the claim that FIDE is hopelessly corrupt and beyond reform as a governing body for chess. While FIDE does ""possess"" three key assets at the heart of chess as a sport - the rating infrastructure, the title system and the World Championship - Wolff argues that it would not be impossible to replicate these things with a new, more capable governing body, especially in the wake of the pandemic chess boom. Wolff also notes that while Kasparov attempted to wrest control from FIDE in the 1990s with the [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Chess_Association), chess was not ""ready"" to be mainstreamed as a viable broadcast sport at the time especially after the loss of its primary sponsor, Intel. Wolff suggests that a new governing body would not have such issues because of the game's growing popularity, and that streaming could generate revenue for it in a way that the PCA was never able to with television alone. Finally, Wolff adds that such a new body would likely need buy-in from two of chess's most important institutions: the largest chess website, [chess.com](https://chess.com), and the game's most renowned star Magnus Carlsen. He seemed unsure that Magnus might be interested in something like this but was sure that [chess.com](https://chess.com) now has enough sway in the chess world to get such a project off the ground. I am interested to hear what this sub thinks of GM Wolff's claims. Can FIDE be fixed, and if not could a ""new PCA"" be viable in the current climate?"	4.0	t3_19389db	reddit

Unknown	2024-01-09 18:14:44	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/192lbhe/i_dont_have_that_dog_in_me_what_now/	"I played my first OTB tournament in a long time over new years eve and performed dismally, losing to lower-rated opponents because (I think) my sporting qualities are just not there. I'm trying to win purely by skill, without taking any risks and when the position is even or slightly worse I could not summon the fighting spirit (dawg) to either defend or hang in there. I routinely lost or 50:50 or worse positions because I didn't want to win badly enough to summon extra energy or focus. Losing annoyed me for a bit, but did not bother me too much. In summary, I watch a lot of sports and if i was to describe myself, it would be that ""i don't have that dawg in me"" as the cliche goes. Zero competitive edge. Basically i can beat much weaker opponents by pure skill but as soon as i get anyone equally matched or even lower rated who puts up resistance, I immediately collapse. 1) Is this a real thing or am I trying to rationalize gaps in my chess skill and i can still overpower opponents by skill if i just got better? 2) if it is, and i believe it's innate how can i deal with the consequences?

16	Learning to play Shogi completely turned me away from Chess	Unknown	2024-01-09 04:08:55	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1925mnb/learning_to_play_shogi_completely_turned_me_away/	(English isn't my first language) Now after you've read the title and you getting yourself ready to downvote me to hell (no hard feelings, btw), please hear me out and allow me to bring attention to this rich and intellectually stimulating game that is Shogi, or Japanese Chess: Since 2012 I was a Chess fanatic and over the years I played thousands upon thousands of games. My peak rating was around 2000 on Lichess and that made me more proud than most things in my life. Until this day I consider Carlsen, Kasparov and Anand as geniuses and my personal heroes. But during the last year the enjoyment I derived from Chess dwindled and I got seriously burned out from the 'samey-ness' of many of my games; it felt as if I was going nowhere and most of my moves became robotic, mere reflexes without much thought put in any longer. So I decided to expand my horizon and got familiar with many different Chess variants I could sink my time in, played them against bots on pychess, but none of them gave me the same satisfaction as Shogi, which I played with the Western Style piece set back then (so no Japanese characters). What I love about it is the following: 1. If you lose the Queen, it's basically game over for you because she's so overpowered, but in Shogi the pieces are much more balanced and compliment themselves more elegantly. It never feels pointless to keep on going after you blundered a piece as it oftentimes is in Chess. 2. The number of pieces on the board stays throughout a game always the same, as pieces captured by your opponent can be employed again by them, just like in Crazyhouse. This means the action never decreases and it opens up a whole new level of tactical maneuvers and 'insane' piece sacs, basically until the very last move. In my last game I sacrificed my rook to get my opponent's silver general which led to a beautiful combination to mate his king. And nearly every game has such astonishing twists and turns which gives every turn much more weight than in Chess. 3. I just like the game aesthetics more. I also really like that the board is slightly larger, in Chess the pieces always felt so constrained. 4. The power ceiling in Shogi is absurdly high. If you, for example, watch Caruana or Svidler playing their games, you acknowledge that these are elite masters but you still 'get' what's going on on the board; not so in Shogi. Here, the games of professionals don't even seem to be the same game anymore, because Shogi is that much more complex than Chess. Even though it takes just ~10 minutes to learn its rules. In the end, Shogi made me realize the various little flaws in Chess, after seeing its better alternative. The reason for this thread was to give you an unbiased report about this game, coming from a (former) Chess lover as myself. I hope you're not too offended by my words and I'd really like to hear your opinions and former experiences with Shogi (or maybe another variant which was really fun for you).

When I was a child my grandmother had an awesome chessboard. Sadly, it is now gone and I have no picture for reference. But I remember it. The board was made of wood, the size of a table, and the color was light brown and dark brown. The style of pieces were medieval (maybe English). They were large (maybe ceramic-ish) about the size of a man’s fist (maybe slightly larger?). Pawns were a soldiers head with simple helm (no visor), but the back was completely flat. Knights were horse heads. Rooks were square towers. Bishops, queen, and king were busts of a person in that medieval style. I cannot recall if their backs were flat like the pawns. EDIT: I just remembered the bottom of the pieces had a soft felt. It was freaking amazing, and I want to find a similar one. Anybody have any idea how to track it down?	0.0	t3_1934ft6	reddit

33	How much I spend on Chess in 2023? ($11338)	FM :Verified_Master:	2024-01-08 14:58:39	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/191n2f4/how_much_i_spend_on_chess_in_2023_11338/	I have never seen a blog post where chess players are telling their expenses. Most people think that chess is an expensive game and it’s true. If you are a hobby player then it’s quite cheap but for those who are title aspirants, it’s a really expensive sport. For those who don’t have time to read full-time, the total spending is $11338 ($10278 on tournaments + $430 on Books and Courses + $630 on Chess Coaching) ## Disclaimer 1. Tournament and coaching expenses vary from player to player and country to country. Some players might feel this amount huge or some players feel it low. 2. Suggestions are always welcome. 3. I have tracked all the expenses in Indian Rupees. Although for viewers I have converted all amounts in USD. The amount is approximate (3-5%) ## 1- Tournament Expenses ($11338) I started my first classical event with the Baku Open and Finished the year with the Rilton Cup 2023-24. I am not going to add any tournament links as I am going to publish year in review blog post later. Let’s go by each tour/event. Expenses include everything i.e. Flights, Travel costs, entry fee, stay, and food. ## Baku Open - $1020 This event was held in Azerbaijan and it was a +2250 event. ## Nagpur GM Event - $480 Nagpur is a city in India and it hosted the 2nd Maharashtra Grandmaster event. ## Europe Tour (5 Events) - $4085 In total, I played 5 tournaments in this including 5 open events and 1 GM closed event in 4 different countries. ## Abu Dhabi Masters - $1140 Event in UAE ## Qatar Masters - $1440 This is the most prestigious event I have ever played. In the same event Magnus, Anish, and Hikaru participated. ## Rilton Cup 2023-24 - $1863 Event in Sweden ## Rapid Events - $250 I played many events in Rapid events in India. I have all the records but here I am just putting the total. Ofc I won prize money but here we are only talking about expenses. ## 2- Books and Chess Material Expenses ($430) I purchased a lot of materials this year. I find so much value in books and courses. Let’s say if you want to take a coaching from GM, it will cost you $50-100. With the same price, you can buy a good chess course and save a lot of money. Although personal coaching does have many benefits. Following is my list of purchases in 2023 ## Modern Chess Courses I have purchased a lot of chess courses from the Modern Chess website. I have an affiliate with them where users can save a lot of money. I also used this code and sale benefits These courses are too good compared to other websites and the major benefit is that they provide you with the PGN file which you can see in chessbase. Following is the list of courses I bought * Advance Variation against French and Caro-Kann (6h Running Time) * Beat the Sicilian - Practical Repertoire for White (9h Video Running Time) * Practical Endgame Play (9h Running Time) * Scotch Game - Expert Repertoire for White * Play the Ruy Lopez * Top-Level Repertoire against the Sicilian * King's Indian Defence - Expert Repertoire for Black * Play the Sveshnikov Sicilian * 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 - Repertoire against 3.Bb5 & Nc3 * Play the Gruenfeld Defence * French Defence - Top-Level Repertoire for Black ## Chessable Courses * Tame the Sicilian: The Alapin Variation ## Chessbase Courses and Tools * Chessbase 17 * Play the Sveshnikov Sicilian by Dorian Rogozenco * Fritz 19 - (I don’t know why I purchased it) ## Books - All bought from ChessBase India and Forward Chess * A Matter of Endgame Technique * The Match of All Time: The Inside Story of the legendary 1972 Fischer-Spassky World Chess Championship in Reykjavik * How I Became a Chess Grandmaster by Vinay Bhat * Chess Middlegame Strategies Volume 2 * Chess Lessons: Solving Problems & Avoiding Mistakes: By Mark Dvoretsky * Forcing Chess Moves * Endgame Labyrinth ## 3- Chess Coaching Expense In total, I did 2 coaching camps for Indian GM Vishnu. These camps were only for +2200 players and I was more than happy with his teaching approach. No personal or any other group classes apart from following. ## Camp 1 - $150 This camp was held online on Zoom. So only camp fees were the expenses ## Camp 2 - $480 For this camp, I traveled to Chennai and the camp duration was 5 days. ## How do I manage these Expenses? This year I managed to earn some active income from 3 major sources and barely managed to make all the above expenses. ## 1- Affiliates For the last 2 years, I am doing blogging and learning a lot of new things. I also run a website called Chess Article and my own blogs, newsletters, etc. I have partnered with many chess websites such as Modern Chess, The Chess World, Chessify, Square Off, and many more. Because of this, I managed to get a decent amount from all the sales. ## 2- Chess Coaching Chess coaching can be a very good revenue source especially for above 2000 rated players. Many of my friends are doing full-time chess coaching and making a living out of it. As I was trying to achieve some title, I was not accepting many students at one time. Now in 2024, I am also giving priority to chess coaching. ## 3- Winning Chess Tournaments I played many rapid and blitz events throughout 2023 and several prizes. I am planning to play more rapid and blitz events in 2024 ## Is it worth it? Since 2021, when I started coaching and started to earn some money, I understood how difficult it is to earn money. This is why I don’t think spending this much amount is worth it, especially on chess. But the problem was I was trying to get the title and hence had to play good events. Most of the events I played are atleast +2100 where you get high chances to increase the rating as you don’t play against the lower players. ## How much do other players spend? I talked with 8-10 other Indian players ranging between 2000-2450. All of them spent anywhere between $7-20k. Some of them take regular chess coaching which costs them $5-7k a year or more. Even I know few Indian GMs above 2500 who spent 8-10k+ Although all of the above guys are aiming for something. Some trying to get an FM title to some trying to reach a 2600 rating. ## Your thoughts If you are an active chess player with any chess rating, I request you to share your thoughts or how much you spent on coaching, playing, etc.	57.0	t3_191n2f4	reddit

I want to switch to playing the Dragon Sicilian as my primary weapon against e4 and realised that the King's Indian Defence has an extremely similar pawn structure and even some similar lines. That being said, though, from viewing some model games, it seems like the KID usually plays with pawn storms on the kingside, while the Dragon often plays on the queenside. Is it useful to play these two openings together or are they too different to make it any more useful than any other pair of openings? Thank you in advance.	5.0	t3_192w4jr	reddit

He plays at a far higher level than myself. He does not have any internet where he lives - so he needs standalone chess programs. I've installed Tarrasch, chessmaster grandmaster, fritz 11 and 12, and The Chess Lv.100. He's come back today asking for more chess programs and complaining that some of them are not hard enough. &#x200B; My question is: What chess programs would you all recommend? Free is good, and paid is fine too. He is willing to pay up to 100$ outright for a program, but won't do monthly subscriptions. &#x200B; TL;DR: I need offline chess programs for an old high level chess player.	2.0	t3_192u6c8	reddit		
39	Can Magnus win this?	Unknown	2024-01-10 05:51:10	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/19313ft/can_magnus_win_this/	Purely theoretical exercise, and maybe this has been asked before, but can 2019 peak Magnus win against a team of all the best players from the past? Like, all the WCs and including other strong players who werent WCs like Keres, Korchnoi, Pillsbury, etc. Starting from Morphy till Kasparov's time (including people like Anand, Kramnik, etc). Consider this a match (not game) of 6 games (or maybe less). Suppose they're all cooperating and not being egotistical maniacs like Fischer. Supposing all of them are at their prime but not updated with current chess knowledge. I mean if Fischer is given all the chess knowledge of the 21st century he would most likely be enough i think. Probably even beat Magnus. But for the purpose of this exercise, we are restricting them all to their level in their own times. Edit: For the sake of completion, lets just assume that if there are draws, there would be a rapid and blitz playoff.	6.0	t3_19313ft	reddit

Unknown	2024-01-08 14:55:03	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/191mzo8/is_chess_a_gentlemens_game/	"While skimming through Silman's ""**How to Reassess your Chess**"", I noticed a short section in the end, called ""Is Chess a Gentlemen's Game?"". With so many people complaining about what happens to them in online chess chats, I thought this snippet might provide some perspective on what might happen in the real world. &#x200B; >Anonymous asked: > >I thought chess was supposed to be a gentleman's game, but at times my opponents act rudely during tournament play. What can I do about this? > >Dear Anonymous, During a tournament in Los Angeles, two players got into a fight while playing and began stabbing each other with their pens. This is probably not a good way to deal with a rude opponent. In fact, the only correct thing to do when an unruly imbecile is sitting opposite you is to find the tournament director and ask him to put an end to your opponent's deplorable behavior before it escalates into something like the aforementioned duel. > >Rude and/or crazy behavior is a time-honored part of the game. The 1 6th Century Spanish priest and chess player Ruy Lopez de Segura recommended that, when playing outside, you should always face your opponent toward the sun so he will be unable to see the whole board through his permanent squint. > >I've personally faced players who covered the whole spectrum of bizarre behavior: one guy would whistle a song (his tone would get more dominating if he felt he was doing well, and it would taper off into a beaten, pathetic drone if he was losing), another would mumble, an old man made disgusting gagging sounds from the first move to the last, another old man kept saying, ""Go get the body! Go get the body!"" over and over, and one guy who appeared to have a bird's nest on his head kept picking at it, popping whatever he had gotten from the nest into his mouth. He goes on to recall other nefarious incidents, even involving an IM and a politician.

Now we have to work a lot on tactics ofc, some positional understanding and some basic endgames, but we all know that openings are always fun to work on and can actually help develop a good understanding of the game as well, if done right. Student wants to play everything, so he goes from queens gambit to e4, and with black will play the sicilian, caro kann, or just d5. I advised him to drop the sicilian for now, and maybe we can pick it up at 1500 and fully dedicate to understanding it better and knowing more lines. I think it will be better for him to just play e4 e5 with black and d4 d5, but the caro-kann is a good opening too for a 1200 to get to 1500 with. I also think he should play e4 and go for more tactical, open games, because right now it is just too solid, you know, like he will play d4, and then just have a very quiet game with a lot of trades, not really helping him to see a lot of tactical positions. That's why I recommend e4 and the Italian, and throwing in some gambits besides the main line now and then. Do you guys agree with this approach? If any higher rated players or coaches with experience on this specific trajectory from 1200-1500 could share their insights, i would much appreciate it.	1.0	t3_192iq2r	reddit

I am thinking of playing by setting up the board and trying to play from the losers point of view and trying to guess what the winner is going to play and then see what the winner moved and then trying to find what the loser should do and see what he did. I would like to know how long I should spend studying per master game. Especially if you are a titled player or a coach your advice would be most welcome.	3.0	t3_192jyhf	reddit		
64	Chess speed run with very aggressive openings?	Unknown	2024-01-09 11:14:12	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/192ce62/chess_speed_run_with_very_aggressive_openings/	For the most part I've always played really solid chess but recently I've enjoyed playing much more aggressively. I love learning from speed runs, and I'm wondering if anyone knows of any that tend to gear towards gambits and attacking chess rather than more solid principles? Not just looking for a stream of Hikaru obliterating people with dubious openings, I want someone who explains their thought process. If it's at all relevant I hover around 1850 on lichess.	7.0	t3_192ce62	reddit

66	Which settings to use for Lc0 to run optimally?	Unknown	2024-01-09 11:05:07	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/192c95c/which_settings_to_use_for_lc0_to_run_optimally/	Hi there! I'm trying to dig deeper in a few openings I really enjoy playing.For that I am using engine tournaments on my PC. Now engines like stockfish are rather simple to set up but Lc0 has a bunch of settings that are not as self explanatory as the others. This circumstance leads to Lc0 losing/drawing virtually all positions against Stockfish, even when Lc0 starts with a +0.7 advantage which I think it should easily be able to convert against an equally strong opponent. Could anyone give me some advice as to which settings improve/weaken what part of Lc0's game?I attached an image to this post showing all of the available settings, while some of them are easily explained by looking at the lczero website, other's that are listed on the website are non-existent in the settings available to me (e.g. 'Threads' and 'RamLimitMB') while other settings are just explained too cryptically to actually figure out what happens when I change them (e.g. 'Backend').

Apparently this percentile is \~91% but that includes so many casual players. Actually I am not that good and am not even a great club player (yes I made it into a university chess team but the worst one). Not to mention I'm 600 something in blitz (3+2). 1200 rapid vs like 650 in blitz, that's a huge discrepancy, maybe because my time management is quite bad. My accuracy is only on average a hair above 80%. Often I get games with 70% something accuracy, often 80%, sometimes 90% something, occasionally 60% something Account: [https://www.chess.com/stats/live/rapid/viktormancnew/7](https://www.chess.com/stats/live/rapid/viktormancnew/7) I won't play a game until maybe tomorrow or 2-3 days later as I need to revise. How am I even supposed to actually be good at chess? I still keep blundering, keep missing forks. Surely 1200 rapid is not a good elo. Some even argue 2000 Elo is when you finally start thinking you're good at chess but actually you're not. Then when can I even say I am good at chess? When I am a FIDE Candidate Master or FIDE Master (if I even reach that level, at this rate 5+ years or 10+ years if I even get there at all). Do I need a few years just to be good? &#x200B;	33.0	t3_192empb	reddit

75	Is this person I played cheating? Sorry if this is against the rules.	Unknown	2024-01-09 18:19:27	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/192lfpi/is_this_person_i_played_cheating_sorry_if_this_is/	Hey r/chess, sorry moderators if this is against the rules. I have read rule 8, but the games I played were both Anonymous on Lichess, meaning there were no usernames and I have no accounts to report. I am not calling anyone out, just looking for an answer really. I played against someone I work with on something recently, and even though the thing we work on isn't related to chess, nor did she ever show any signs of being good at chess, I was very suspicious about a few things, that hopefully someone can help me with. Here is the first game: 1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. e3 e6 4. c3 Bd6 5. Bg3 O-O 6. Bd3 Nbd7 7. Nf3 h6 {One of the top engine moves.} 8. Nbd2 b6 {Top engine move.} 9. Qc2 Bxg3 {Top engine move.} 10. hxg3 c5 {Top engine move.} 11. c4 Bb7 {Top engine move.} 12. Ne5 cxd4 {One of the top engine moves.} 13. exd4 Rc8 {One of the top engine moves.} 14. Nb3 dxc4 {Top engine move.} 15. Nxc4 b5 16. Rc1 bxc4 17. Bxc4 Nb6 18. Nd2 Qxd4 19. O-O Qe5 20. Qc3 Qh5 21. Qb4 Ng4 {After Ng4, White resigns.} * I am playing White in both games, and I know I am by no means a good chess player, I am rated around 1000 on [Chess.com](https://Chess.com), but I was destroyed in this game. The conditions that she set were that we played on Lichess only, not [Chess.com](https://Chess.com), that we played a Daily game, and she also didn't have an account on Lichess. She showed \*some\* signs of cheating, such as taking a consistent amount of time on each move, which was also quite a while. She also played a series of top engine moves, and was very smug about the win afterwards. But it was only after I asked her to play me in a Blitz game that I became very suspicious. 1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. Nxd4 Nxe4 {Free Knight $2} 6. Nxe4 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 c5 {Free Pawn $2} 8. Nxc5 b6 9. Ne4 f5 10. Nd6+ Ke7 11. Nxc8+ Qxc8 12. Bd3 Qc7 {Another free Pawn.} 13. c3 g6 {Completely free Rook.} 14. Qxh8 Bg7 {Completely free Bishop.} 15. Qxg7+ {After Qxg7+, Black lost on time.} * In this game, she proceeded to play like a complete beginner, which I was very confused about, as it was like I was playing someone completely different. She blundered a bunch of her pieces, even though she still took considerable time on each move, and ended up losing on time. She claimed afterwards that she's been playing chess for a long time, but from what I can tell normally, if you're really good at slow chess, that ability also transfers over to speed chess, and you can at the very least not blunder all your pieces, because you're playing on intuition. Anyway, sorry for the long post, but am I just salty? Or am I right to be suspicious? Any answers are greatly appreciated, and I am happy to answer any questions. TL;DR: I got destroyed in first Daily game, then in second game which was Blitz, opponent blundered all of her pieces. Now I am suspicious.	7.0	t3_192lfpi	reddit		
76	The hardest moves in chess are Pawn breaks	Unknown	2024-01-08 03:52:11	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/191bs0a/the_hardest_moves_in_chess_are_pawn_breaks/	I find pawn breaks the most daunting move in chess to make. You end up creating weak squares, in often cases breaking up a very solid structure to open the position. These can be fairly simple in endgames with a piece or two left, but in complex middle games, these become extremely hard. Like every turn you have to calculate the consequences of them taking the pawn, pushing their pawn, not reacting and doing a million other things. I understand basic principles like in d4 openings you are usually trying to get e4 in or vice versa in e4 openings. But beyond that, often times, I find it very hard to evaluate these pawn breaks and usually do them based of instinct, as there are so many possibilities, especially in middle games of like the Queen's gambit, Ruy lopez, Italian, Nimzo etc where usually all the pieces are on the board. Is there a resource that tackles this specifically guiding you to know when to push a pawn, how to evaluate it properly etc Edit: most importantly, WHEN do you go for the pawn break? It’s usually already well known which pawn breaks are thematic for a certain opening, but it’s often not clear when to go for it, is it like when all your pieces are on the best squares or opponents pieces are misplaced or is there some sort of checklist to help with this?	14.0	t3_191bs0a	reddit

If we have 1/3/5 squares from the enemy and it is our turn, we get it. How do we take it from here? Let's ignore the pawns: if we go f5, Black goes f6 or h6 and has the opposition.

Help by trying it out (it's free!) and giving feedback and ideas! &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/w4vmcr5py1bc1.png?width=1329&format=png&auto=webp&s=5046715f47df72feb6fbdca17be5b772b98d91f5 # The idea I spent a big part of growing up playing Chessmaster and the host of (admittedly quite basic) bots it had. I remember Chessmaster having tournaments against he bots, which had me hooked. Back in those days we had ICC, and there were bots there, but Chessmaster just made it more of an experience. Online chess can be stressful and toxic, and sometimes bots is the way to go, but I find the current offering (it's mainly just the chess.com and Lichess bots) to be a bit lacking. You just play single games, and there's really no aim or purpose with playing. I thought it should be possible to make it a lot more engaging, while also making the bots more interesting, both in the way they play and the way they act. # Who am I Just a bit of background, I'm a programmer (spent many years working at Spotify) and an avid chess player (\~1900 FIDE). Years back I also dabbled in chess engine programming and blogged about it on [https://mediocrechess.blogspot.com/](https://mediocrechess.blogspot.com/). I like to mention that Mediocre was the worlds strongest Java chess engine for a while (though not with a lot of competition to be completely honest). I'm hoping my experience can help turn Chessiverse into the goto place for playing chess bots. At least I'll try! # What Chessiverse has (so far) I've spent the last few months creating Chessiverse, it can be a bit rough around the edges still, but I think it's progressed to a stage where it feels like a complete experience. Of course there's still ways to go, and I'm not slowing down now! The main focus right now is the bots. I want each and every bot to feel like a unique experience, and you should be able to find your favorite opponent, no matter what your strength is or what openings you like to play. Here's an example: &#x200B; [Reed Pages plays the Jobava London as white, and the Dutch as black. And has an estimated rating 1577 FIDE](https://preview.redd.it/8bgoxi6a42bc1.png?width=1129&format=png&auto=webp&s=058cd16534e74c3153d3479319dd949eb576a09a) Every single bot has it's own style, and play should vary vastly between the bots. * All bots have their own **unique neural net.** The nets are similar to Maia Chess and I feel play very human-like, but you be the judge! * They also have their own completely **unique opening book**. The openings are not just a few moves, it's an entire opening book generated from games played by humans at around the bot's rating. Every bot also have their own **unique personality**. Not just some pre-programmed phrases, but an entire background story, and using ChatGPT the conversation is generated dynamically. Making for interesting conversations, that aim to feel real. [The bots have their own personality, with a background story, occupation, age, and all kinds of other traits, and using ChatGPT they act as it](https://preview.redd.it/q3sp2s8652bc1.png?width=1301&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c03b64b78cb313af288e8b27a3840cdaf384503) The playing and personality is the current main focus to get right. I'm working on improvements that make the conversations more coherent and the playing as interesting and predictable (in a good way) as possible. Here I need help though, since there is currently over **350 live bots** and more are being added every day. &#x200B; [There are currently 372 live bots on Chessiverse, each with their unique neural net, opening book and background story](https://preview.redd.it/m8fwm6xo62bc1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4c9cf572f3e05664f448861e947e92b8b03799d) I try to keep the bots' ratings as close as possible to FIDE. If a bot has 1500 rating, it should feel like playing against a 1500 FIDE rated opponent. This makes the bots pretty bad for confidence boosting. As a 1900 rated player I've gotten whooped by 1700 rated bots, which is quite different from the super-inflated chess.com bots. I think it's the right way to go, but if you're used to chess.com, get ready for a reality check. Other than the bots themselves there are, for now, three main features on Chessiverse. * **Play** \- Play the bots and try to beat as many as you can. * **Practice** \- One of the main benefits of bots is that they don't complain when you want to practice your latest opening repertoire, and playing against an opponent of similar strength is the best way to understand positions (rather than getting crushed by Stockfish). The practice section on Chessiverse contains a selection of pre-curated positions (like Greek Gift and basic openings), but you can also setup whatever position you like. * **Puzzles** \- Of course there had to be puzzles, but I wanted it to be at least a bit Chessiverse-like, so I took the top voted puzzles from the Lichess puzzle database and let the bots generate hints for them. That way you can do harder puzzles and not just be given the moves if you get stuck, but instead some more or less cryptic hints in the right direction from the bots. # Future I plan to spend the coming months, and hopefully years, improving Chessiverse. There's a already a backlog with ideas, and I'm very curious to hear what more you can come up with! Right now Chessiverse is completely free without ads, and I hope it can stay that way for a long time. But to be clear, the ChatGPT API does cost quite a bit (and of course the usual servers and similar), so I can't promise it will stay so forever. But for now, go ahead and try it out! # Anyway! If this sounds interesting to you, give it a try at [https://chessiverse.com](https://chessiverse.com), and make sure you leave feedback and ideas for improvement. This journey has just started, I'm hoping we can make Chessiverse a place for all chess players to enjoy! **Edit:** The most requested feature, being able to get the pgn and analyzing on Lichess or chess.com, was just deployed.

88	Hitting the Brick wall	Unknown	2024-01-08 12:36:45	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/191k9pb/hitting_the_brick_wall/	Hey y’all. I have been playing chess for a few months and I am stuck at 1200 ElO rapid. these past few days have been especially brutal. I have 10 game lose streaks constantly playing unrated games, and when switching it up to blitz, I just dropped to 800. Is losing this badly even normal in chess? Or have I peaked and will simply never get better? What do I do to get better?	17.0	t3_191k9pb	reddit

After I cancelled my subscription number of people with flairs dropped significantly. Have anyone experienced something like that? On one hand I'm just curious but on the other hand if it's true it can mean chessdotcom have different ratings for free and premium players which can give fake feeling of progress by just buying premium (to certain level) and I think people should be aware of that. Unfortunatelly I can't tell if it was a thing for me, because I had a little break before I cancelled my subscription so my rating dropped by ~100-150 ELO after I came back to playing and then I was playing on Lichess for a while so I don't know if going back to my peak on chessdotcom was natural progress or just comeback to my previous level.	4.0	t3_19215rg	reddit

There were other interesting parts of the article that I think is worth highlighting. >When questioned about the reasons behind his decision for not playing more world championship matches, Carlsen candidly expressed: ""I would say the main reason is that I don't enjoy it. It's as simple as that. "" &#x200B; >""I really don't miss it. I really like the life that I have now. Both playing from home, but also travelling and playing tournaments. I simply don't need it,"" Carlsen said. &#x200B; >With a total of 17 world championship titles under his belt, the 33-year-old emphasized that the best player needs to excel at all formats: classical, rapid, and blitz. &#x200B; >""Obviously the rating system lags a bit behind, but if you look at that over time, that's a pretty good indication of who the best players are,"" he said, humorously adding: ""Also, if you want to know who the best player is, you don't have to look at all the different formats; **you can just look for my name**!"" It seems to me like most of the top players actually don't enjoy the classical format at all. [MVL recently was in C2 podcast. Caruana brought up about classical chess being phased out, MVL agrees that it will happen at some point and has also indicated **he likes Magnus' suggestion of 2 x 45|30 rapid games instead of a single classical game per day**.

I am currently 19 years old and have restarted playing chess since Corona (like many people), I used to play chess when I was young but quit because I though I was good enough and focused on other things.. I got to 1850 on chess com in about one and a half year and took a year long break afterwards. 3 months ago I started playing again and now i'm actually getting more serious about studying and playing chess. Everyday I train tactics, work through Chessable courses, read books(Yusupov series) and play some 15 minute rapid games on chess com. I also play at my local chess club (now with external teams) and otb I find myself playing much better than online, I even drew someone who used to be around 2000 FIDE rated).

Unknown	2024-01-08 07:56:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/191fzmu/how_do_you_actually_learn_an_opening/	I find that when I am playing openings where I know the plans (ex. Some QG lines where you castle long and pawn storm or the main line of KID) that my results are really good. I don’t have long lines memorized but because I know what I’m generally shooting for, my game feels harmonious and coordinated. Outside of these specific instances though I don’t feel like I know what I’m supposed to be aiming for. I know how to look for weak squares and general piece placement principles (improving bad pieces, finding outposts, etc.) but that leaves me more responding to my opponents mistakes rather than being in the driver’s seat. I always see people say that you should learn openings and not necessarily memorize moves (at least to the extent possible) but virtually everywhere you look for help, you see mostly lists of moves and very little instruction on what the middle game plans are. So, in short, how do you learn openings and what resources do you use? I’m ~1100 rapid on chess.com so I’m not quite a beginner but I’m also not good either and a lot of chess texts are beyond what I can absorb at the moment. Thanks	6.0	t3_191fzmu	reddit

I have been learning for 3 years, since I was ten, on my birthday. I never understood how to get checkmate. I was confused and I had no strategy. But then, it accidentally happened. The king was trapped in the corner surrounded by 3 pawns. But there was an opening. Checkmate, by moving the rook. And I was so happy. I played more and more games, and it finally clicked on what I had to do. If you are a new chess player or an old one, when you do something new, celebrate. It’s always good to celebrate progress. How did I learn? Simple. I wanted to improve, because I taught my friend chess, but he could do checkmate before me. I knew I had to improve.	3.0	t3_190uv78	reddit

Link to the account: [https://lichess.org/@/OhNoHerMajesty](https://lichess.org/@/OhNoHerMajesty) The only rule for this challenge was to sacrifice my queen in the first three moves of the game to a pawn or a minor piece and keep sacrificing it until my opponent took it.

While I initially tried to lock up the pawn structure and play defensive (as this was the most successful strategy in the Bullet version), playing very aggressively and sacrificing a few pawns is the best strategy. 2. The outcome of half of the matches felt out of my control as my opponents simply defended their king and traded everything down for a victory. In the other half, I was making very unsolid moves, hoping to catch my opponent off guard. 3. Avoiding common pawn structures gave me better results as 1700s play much more comfortably and quickly in those. I was surprised by how many people I was able to flag. 4. My rating prediction for this challenge in the previous post of 1850 was too optimistic. While the highlights do not feature any of them as they are boring, a lot of games were just my opponents crushing me. 5. Aggressive opening attacks saved the day in many games but I think it is due to the time pressure. I predict my Blitz (10+0) rating to be 1600 because of this. Hope you enjoyed reading this!

I would win maybe 1/10 games or so and it was frustrating me beyond belief since my blitz rating literally can’t get any lower (100 elo). I am learning the London system and studying a lot but still could not win anything. I took this subs advice and played my first slower game which was a 15|10. I ended up winning on move 38 with a Nf7#. (Game posted below if you want to check it out) I literally screamed after the game was over! Yes there were some moves I can improve on and I didn’t play perfect, but it felt way more rewarding than winning a 3 or 5 min blitz. Anyway, just thought I would share this with you guys. As a husband, father of 4, and someone who is dedicated to work, I don’t have time to participate in the local chess club, and none of my friends are into chess, so you all are the only ones who will understand and I can brag to (even though it wasn’t much).

Time control for the tournament is G/60; d5. I got into chess during the pandemic/chess boom and have mostly played online rapid (rated 1750 on [chess.com](https://chess.com)). A couple of the things I'm concerned about: * Opening prep * I mostly stick to the same openings. London system as white, Caro Kann against e4 and Minzo-Indian against d4. * I'm expecting over the board players to play different lines than what I'm used to seeing online. * Is it worth prepping openings to the English (c4) or any other possibilities for White? Online I typically just rely on opening principles and hope for the best. * End games * A lot of online games either end up unequal coming out of the middle game, or have low time once reaching the end-game so it ends up being a time scramble. I'm generally familiar with basic end-game ideas (opposition, the pawn square rule, basic mating patterns). I haven't had a lot of practice in tricky end games (winning vs. drawing king and pawn end games, triangulation, etc.) * Long calculations * With rapid games you rarely spend longer than 30s - 1min calculating a single move. With the longer time format it feels like you might need to spend a lot more time calculating in a tactical or sharp position. Any advice on practicing those longer calculations? Finally, I think a lot of my wins online are either capitalizing on an opponent's blunder or putting pressure on them with an attack. In a longer time format it seems like more positional and nuanced ideas have to be considered (pawn structure, e.g.) Any advice for how to prepare between now and the tournament would be appreciated :)	6.0	t3_190vqqr	reddit

Personally it'll go for like this for me, knight<bishop<rook. It's personally because rook feels like the easiest for me to get checked by, and a bishop is easier to avoid by staying on an opposing color.

Joined a club, and so on. I have never studied chess before but am aware that there are specific openings which I'm likely to see which I'm completely unprepared for... so I've been starting to actually study them. I'm looking for people willing to play matches in 10|0 time controls in set openings at around 1800-2200+ lichess to help consolidate that study. Ideally you will be someone that plays the system regularly and is down to discuss your thoughts. I'm looking for maybe 5-10 games played in 10|0 with set openings. I'd like there to be discussion about the openings and your thoughts during them via Discord before/during/after the games. The goal is for me to understand how people who play this opening at my level think about the positions that arise during them. Current openings I'm looking at: - Kings Gambit Schallop Defense (as black) - Queen's Gambit Accepted (as black) - Caro-Kann Advance with 3. ... c5 (as white) - Caro-Kann Advance with 3. ... Bf5, 4. g4 (Bayonet attack) (as white) My lichess is SisyphusClimbs, as is my Discord, if you want to reach out via either of those. I have my own notes in the form of studies on these openings with my thoughts which I would be happy to share with you after the games too. I speak English and my timezone is UTC+0.	1.0	t3_190pdz9	reddit		
159	Online rapid unplayable	Unknown	2024-01-07 17:47:22	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/190xqol/online_rapid_unplayable/	Don't know about you guys, but the rapid pool on lichess (I most often play 10+5) just becomes more and more unplayable.. I am not paranoid but there are so many obvious cheaters! I often get paired against 2200, who are 1300 or 1400 in bullet and play a 97 or 98% accuracy game with a move every 5-7 seconds, playing almost instantly... I report them, but I rarely get refunds and people don't get banned, I don't get it... I love lichess for everything they are doing but this is getting more and more annoying.. and the moderators on lichess seem to be over their head.	5.0	t3_190xqol	reddit

161	If cheating is potentially rampant in Titled Tuesdays, why not remove increment?	Unknown	2024-01-07 21:10:59	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1912o87/if_cheating_is_potentially_rampant_in_titled/	Titled players are known to not prefer slower time controls online because of it being easier to cheat with more time. Increment grants cheaters a buffer and makes it substantially more difficult to lose on time. With Titled Tuesdays being 3+1, why not just make them 3+0? Removing increment would result in more flagging, but it would also make cheating a lot less practical. Proof or not, if the choice is between more flagging and more cheating, the choice seems obvious. Edit: and to those mentioning cheating would still be possible, yes, but if it would make it more difficult, why not at least try the no-increment change? I don't see a downside.	12.0	t3_1912o87	reddit

165	Chess-GPT, 1000x smaller than GPT-4, plays 1500 ELO chess. We can visualize its internal board state, and it accurately estimates the ELO rating of the players in a game.	Unknown	2024-01-06 17:22:32	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1904wm2/chessgpt_1000x_smaller_than_gpt4_plays_1500_elo/	"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct's ELO rating of 1800 is chess seemed magical. But it's not! A 100-1000x smaller parameter LLM given a few million games of chess will learn to play at ELO 1500. This model is only trained to predict the next character in PGN strings (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 …) and is never explicitly given the state of the board or the rules of chess. Despite this, in order to better predict the next character, it learns to compute the state of the board at any point of the game, and learns a diverse set of rules, including check, checkmate, castling, en passant, promotion, pinned pieces, etc. In addition, to better predict the next character it also learns to estimate latent variables such as the ELO rating of the players in the game. &#x200B; We can visualize the internal board state of the model as it's predicting the next character. For example, in this heatmap, we have the white pawn location on the left, a binary probe output in the middle, and a gradient of probe confidence on the right. We can see the model is extremely confident that no white pawns are on either back rank. &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/0z3pvc74suac1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=54aed04c77416fa3a9384cf5ef03c61f3de2a633 I am very curious how this model learns to play well. My first idea is that it just has very good ""intuition"" about what a good move is and how to evaluate if a move is good. The second idea is that it is actually considering a range of moves, and then its opponents potential responses to those moves. Does anyone know about how well people can play purely off of intuition, without thinking about their opponent's response?

This is a bit of a rant out of frustration because obviously I’m lacking in blitz as compared to other modes… but yeah, I need to get better. In bullet I play fast but usually defensive and safe. In rapid I just take time and make solid moves. In blitz I try to find the middle ground, and my brain is clearly shutting off. I’m slightly frustrated, I guess at myself but in general at chess. Or chess.com. I’ve been playing for years but I don’t study. My chess.com puzzle rating is 2500. My rapid rating is 1250. My bullet rating is 1100. My blitz rating is stuck around 750…. I understand blitz is hard, but I seriously cannot wrap my head around the fact that I’m loading it up and being checkmated by 750s in under a minute. Repeatedly. I check their profiles… 1900 puzzle rating and <1k rapid and bullet. Okay. Next profile — 1300 puzzle rating and negligible rapid and bullet. Okay. Next profile — etc. Is a 750 rating equivalent to the others? I feel my bullet rating indicates I can find OK (safe) moves pretty fast. When I play blitz I get stomped by people ~400 elo lower. I don’t understand it. I want to play blitz but this reasoning makes it unfun.	12.0	t3_190zwgp	reddit

Unknown	2024-01-06 23:15:07	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/190d6i0/is_it_possible_to_have_a_practical_engine/	On the Kasparov episode of the C-Squared podcast, they discuss the recent reliance on engines and how while it provides obvious strengths, being purely engine-dependent can be dangerous since the engine does not always give the most practical ways to win for humans. Sometimes, it can give lines that are clearly winning, but that even a super GM over the board would not be able to reliably execute, thus nullifying the usefulness of the line. [(Timestamp)](https://youtu.be/oA2XjWJggTI?t=27m36s) Would it be possible to program an engine that is able to sort variations by practicality? How could practicality be operationalized, if at all? Is there a way for computers to maintain the same (or better) strength as usual (3600-3700 nowadays) while also being able to judge lines based on how reliably a 2600-2800 would be able to execute it?	4.0	t3_190d6i0	reddit

I mean, if someone blunders their queen a resignation is totally normal. I seldom see folks resign for that or even for rooks - that's not what we mean by resigning. Resigning is the honorable way to end a game your ass got beat in. The alternative, making your opponent chase you around with a ridiculous material advantage is just stupid. Resign already. But in my first week on this site, it's pretty much the norm. Worse, if it takes me longer than 2 minutes to a time runout without add-on seconds to maneuver a pawn queening that's just dumb. You lost. I lose all the time, that's how you learn. Edit: It looks like the consensus is in: never resign. Also: Don’t ask questions on the chess forum less people who don’t like the question downvote the related commentary to drive out an answer.	10.0	t3_191c2mp	reddit

Unknown	2024-01-06 15:44:26	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1902pic/new_chess_rpg_game/	I don’t remember how I found it, but there’s a demo for a game on steam called Master of Chess. I played the demo, and it was honestly a VERY interesting idea. You make a character, go to tournaments, have a rating, and you can either play chess yourself, or have your OWN character help you find and make moves, or a mix. It’s basically like a chess life simulator in a way. It’s definitely niche and meta, but from the quick demo I played, I have to say it actually looks kinda crazy. It’s been in the back of my mind for months now, and I think the alpha version is supposed to be realized in Q1 of 2024? I’m not 100% sure. But if this peeks your interest at all, I highly recommend you check it out. I’ve never seen anything like it and it seems like quite an ingenious idea.	6.0	t3_1902pic	reddit

Maybe this is old news, but this was my first time watching, and she's been a *spectacular* host. I don't remember the last time I've been so engaged in a chess tournament, even though I know very little about Anna. Pia is super engaged and excited, seemingly able to talk endlessly for hours on end, all while smiling. Her passion for the game is infectious and makes me want to play! Sure, part of this is probably that she's commentating games for her daughter, but she's clearly also invested for the love of chess. As for her analysis, as (EDIT for clarity: *I* am) someone who's not the greatest player, her commentary feels like the perfect level of depth for me. She doesn't dumb down her analysis - far from it - but she does take the time to explain aspects of a position that might not be so obvious to me. She goes deep into variations while still keeping tabs on overarching strategic ideas, and helps me get into the mindset of the players. Can we get her commentate some other events? I feel like she'd bring a cool perspective to other tournaments!	36.0	t3_18zeil6	reddit

Unknown	2024-01-07 14:10:51	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/190sybt/do_people_get_stuck_at_8001000_rating/	"I have been playing for around 4 months now, and I'm hoovering around 800 ELO after around 250-300 games. When I play against others, I always check their profile after the game. To my surprise, a lot of the guys in the 800-900 range have played thousands of games. It's not uncommon that I play against people with 3-4k games under their belt. Earlier today I played against a guy with 35 thousand games! He had around 800 games in the last 90 days. But he ""only"" had 900 ELO. This is for 20-30 minute long games and not blitz. So we take our time to make our moves. I'm a bit surprised about this. I'm a beginner, but still play fairly even with some of these players who have played thousands of games. This is not a shot at those players. We all have different intentions, styles and desires. But I'm curious if this is an ELO that people commonly get stuck at? I understand that it's harder to move up the rankings the higher you go, but I always thought 800 rating was for us newbies. Even if these players arent serious about the game and never study anything, I would have expected them to slaughter me out of sheer experience. Granted, some of them do play around with me like a cat messing around with a dead mouse. But most of the time we are on a similar level. Again, I'm not downplaying anyone. I'm just very curious if this ELO-range is a well-known ""stop point"" for a lot of players?"	9.0	t3_190sybt	reddit

It's about not getting checked mate before 1 minute has passed. Please do not comment anything about whether 1-minute chess is a real game or not.

It’s just baffling to me that this is equal since black has so many weaknesses such as the 2 pawns, the light-squares around the black king, and the back rank in many scenarios when Rxb6 crashes through	4.0	t3_19094wg	reddit

191	Historical FIDE Rules commentary on premature draws (1975 Laws)	Unknown	2024-01-06 19:26:20	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1907ttu/historical_fide_rules_commentary_on_premature/	"The text is the 1975 Laws, which includes some Interpretations over the prior decades. Note that in some of those days a ""30-move rule"" was extant for some events. http://aekphotography.co.uk/CAA/Laws75.pdf FIDE Interpretations of Article 18.1: 1959.1960, 1963. 1964. **The question of premature draws.** FIDE Interpretation 18.1: 1959. From a sporting point of view it is quite inappropriate that a game be finished before a real combat has commenced; competition ought to imply that every player should try to fight in order to win his game until the moment when the situation does not afford any further hope of victory. Attention is drawn in particular to the fact that in this respect the International Grandmasters and the International Masters of FIDE ought to serve as examples to the other players. Players who repeatedly act without respecting their duty to the organizers and to the chess public may be subject to disciplinary measures taken by the arbiter. FIDE Interpretation 18.1: 1960. It is hardly possible to establish prescriptions sufficiently detailed to be directly applicable to each particular case. On the basis of the general principle that the players may not ignore the necessity of an honest fight, the examination of each particular case ought, according to the opinion of the Commission, to devolve upon the person who is in charge of the tournament in which the game in question has been played. At this examination it must not be forgotten that a player may have quite legitimate reasons-his actual situation in the tournament table, his state of health, etc.-for desisting from whatever prospects he has in a given situation for continuing the game to a victory and that he may therefore be considered entitled to make or accept an offer of a draw. FIDE Interpretation 18.1: 1963. It seems necessary to stipulate clearly and in writing certain moral principles which should guide the game, but are not incorporated in the Laws of Chess, in order to enable the arbiter to secure as far as possible a fair, sportsmanlike contest. The Commission emphasizes the following points- (a) Every agreement to draw should, as a matter of principle, be based on a position on the chessboard which, in the opinion of each of the two players, offers no tangible possibility of pursuing the game to a victorious conclusion without running an obvious risk of defeat. (b) Particular circumstances may exist, however, which should authorize a player to propose or accept a draw in cases differing from those mentioned in (a). It is not possible to define these particular circumstances in a complete manner, just as in the official regulations the stipulations governing agreements to draw should, in the opinion of the Commission, be so conceived as to comprise only basic principles and goals, as competent arbiters must be presumed to know how to apply them to concrete cases in an equitable manner. The principles so formulated relate to a basic principle, according to which each player should conduct his whole game as a fight for the best possible result. Voluntary measures to evade the fight or to favour the opponent or a third player should be held contemptible for reasons of sport and be judged accordingly. It is easy to establish that it is difficult, in certain cases even impossible, to judge correctly the measures to be taken in situations varying in character, and the arbiter should impose penalties only in cases which clearly constitute contraventions of the moral principles involved. FIDE Interpretation 18.1: 1964. An agreement to draw a game before the thirtieth move in many cases involves an act which rightly could be deemed contradictory to the stated principles on premature draws. Tournament arbiters are requested to impose, in cases where clear contraventions of the moral principles of the game are demonstrated, penalties as severe as loss of the game."	0.0	t3_1907ttu	reddit

193	10 Chess Tactical Concepts Every Chess Player Should Know	Unknown	2024-01-07 00:22:39	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/190eoju/10_chess_tactical_concepts_every_chess_player/	"I created a list with 10 chess concepts that I feel every player who want to improve should know about. I also made a youtube video explaining all the move if you want to visualise them as well ( link at the bottom). **1) Skewer:** A skewer is one of the most basic tactic in chess. This happens when your opponent pieces are aligned on a file or diagonal. A skewer is similar to a pin, but in a skewer the most valuable piece is in front and the lowest valuable piece is behind it, leaving it undefended if the valuable piece move out of the way. **2) Interference** In chess, an interference (also referred to as ""obstruction"") occurs when a player inserts a piece between an enemy piece or a crucial square and its defender. This action results in the defender losing the ability to protect the targeted piece or square, often leading to a significant material loss or a checkmate. **3) Clearing Sacrifice** In chess, a clearance sacrifice represents a tactical pattern where a square on the chessboard is deliberately emptied to create open lines for attack. This maneuver often involves sacrificing a piece to clear a particular square or line, thereby replacing a piece that obstructs the attack with one that contributes positively to the attack's effectiveness. We use this sacrifice in order to gain a material or positional advantage. **4) Deflection** Deflection in chess is a tactic that forces an opposing piece to leave the square that it occupy, usually by sacrificing one of our own piece. The reason we do this sacrifice is to distract that particular piece from defending a square, we may need it to win material, promote a pawn or deliver a checkmate. Deflection may be used as a gambit to cause an opponent's piece to move to a less suitable square **5) Overload** Overloading in chess means that an opponent piece is defending multiple pieces and once we capture one of the defended piece, and opponent recapture, the other ones are left undefended, meaning we can easily capture them. Overloading also happens when a piece is defending multiple key squares. **6) Matting Net** A matting net is when we set up the a checkmate threat, cutting in advance of all the squares available for king to escape **7) Simplification** As the name suggest, simplification mean simplifying a position by trading multiple pieces. Good times to use simplification is when we are up material, when are overloaded with opponent pieces or when we are in a time scrumble. **8) Perpetual Checks** As the name suggest it, a perpetual check is giving multiple checks in order to achieve a draw. For the one who don’t know, in Chess we have the “threefold repetition” rule, meaning that if a position happens three time in a game, not three times in a row, three times in a game **9) Creating Passed Pawns:** A protected passed pawn is a passed pawn that is defended by at least one other pawn. It is considered a “passed pawn” if the pawn has crossed the center of the board. This tactical concept is mostly important in the endgame. **10) Attack In The Direction Of Your Pawn Chain** This one is not a really tactical concept, but more of a suggestion and a good rule to keep in mind. If you don’t have a plan or you often wonder yourself “Where to go from this position?” this concept is for you. When the center is closed by pawn chains and you wonder on which side to attack, just look where your pawn chain points. Often it shows you how you should proceed. **Link To Full Video** [https://youtu.be/BRg4r\_kFYmI](https://youtu.be/BRg4r_kFYmI)"	2.0	t3_190eoju	reddit

196	How would you rank the most prestigious chess tournaments?	 BOBBY FISCHER FANBOY	2024-01-06 11:33:30	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18zy50b/how_would_you_rank_the_most_prestigious_chess/	"Since most of the chess world cannot really decide on what the most prestigious active chess events really are (I use the adjective ""active"" to distinguish from discontinued/defunct chess events such as the Zonals/Interzonals, Linares, Dortmund, etc.), I thought it would be interesting to hold a discussion on the same topic. My personal (super subjective) top ten list would go something like: 1.) The World Chess Championship (cuz like 95% of the time it's a contest between the strongest and second strongest player in the world) 2.) The Candidates Tournament (second to the World Championship because it's the only tournament where the world champion isn't allowed to play, but most of the strongest players in the world are) 3.) The FIDE World Cup (path to most candidates events) 4.) The Grand Swiss (same as the CWC, path to most candidates events) 5.) The Grand Prix (feels like a less flashy version of the two tournaments above) 6.) Wijk aan Zee (I place it this high because of the historical context... literally every world champion since Botvinnik has participated in at least one Wijk aan Zee before (except the elusive Bobby Fischer), and, as Bent Larsen himself said, ""Normal people have to see Naples before they die... but a chess grandmaster has to win Wijk aan Zee first."") 7.) Fischer Random World Championship (here I'm just repping Fischer and Carlsen's takes of enjoying intuitive chess over prep and engine memorization) 8.) The Chess Olympiad (it's a team tournament so kinda hard to fit it in here, but I think #8 is its rightful spot) 9.) The Sinquefield Cup (they have often had incredibly strong tournaments, sometimes with all the top players attending, starting from #1) 10.) World Rapid/Blitz Championships (the funnest ones to watch, but not necessarily the most prestigious/coveted... still pretty important tho) Honourable mentions would be the GCT (multiple tournaments), Tal Memorial, Capablanca Memorial, SCC (held by [chess.com](https://chess.com)) and Norway Chess.

I have 1001 Chess Tactics from Games of Every Day Players by Brennan and Carson which I felt was too easy, 1001 Chess Exercises for Club Players by Erwich was too difficult (can get maybe 20% of the puzzles right). 2. A good resource for openings? I know this isn't the most important thing but I feel like learning the principles behind the opening, what you're trying to achieve, and where you want the pieces to end up would help my positional playing.

200	Chessbase replay training question	Unknown	2024-01-06 22:00:17	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/190bfup/chessbase_replay_training_question/	I search a little online, but I seem to have a problem that I can't fix with Chessbase replay training. For some reason, it seems the program will always play the same variations among many, which ever is the longest. For instance when I practice French defense, it will vary between exchange, advance, winawer, etc... but I have many variations for any of these. When it gets to the exchange variation, for instance, it will always play a long game that I entered while omitting all the possible variations. I tried to promote variations, but it seems it just changes the order. Is there any way to tell Chessbase to randomly play every variation with equal probability regardless of its length? If anyone knows how, that would be very appreciated. Thanks.	1.0	t3_190bfup	reddit

Also I'm aware I can technically use the extensions to see if my opponent is miraculously choosing the best moves, but it doesn't turn off on my turn and even if it did, it would still feel like cheating cause I would always be prepared for my opponent's best move.

I picked up chess in 2020 around the time of the first pogchamps and all I've really done is play on [chess.com](https://chess.com/). I haven't practiced chess in any other way, not even puzzles. Despite that I've reached 1700+ elo in all formats (rapid, blitz and bullet) and peaked near 1800. Tbh I don't even play rapid, literally all I've done is grind blitz and bullet everyday (10k-15k games across all my accounts and all time controls) and my rapid naturally improved as I got better at blitz. The only openings I play are the italian, but mostly I just try to develop my pieces into the center and half the games I try to castle on the opposite side and attack. I feel like I've hit a wall and got to the point where I should practice and put in some work to see improvement. I hate doing puzzles because they are not fun to do at all. To sit there and think about the entire sequence of moves and possible enemy moves... it's just not my cup of tea. Honestly I still enjoy the game and will keep playing 3+0 even if I don't improve.

After not playing for a month because I got fed up with it, I came back and played a game. Then the winning streaks returned and I went up to 1300 when I ended at like 1050 (I lost a lot of games...). This reminds me of overtraining in sports. I can't run long distances 7 days a week as that will prevent healing from injuries and allowing the body time to rest and build muscle. I can't benchpress everyday because that'll just lead to torn muscles, injuries, and a sharp decline in strength. Could the sme be told for chess or did I just hit a skill wall in the match making?

I have really been getting into chess for the past few months, and I'm fascinated by all the openings and defenses. My question is: how do you decide what to learn next? I know that learning tactics and getting better at specific openings is what's usually recommended but I find it fun to learn new attacks and counter-attacks. Once you master and/or get bored of an opening, what's your thought process to decide which to learn next?	4.0	t3_18zpoja	reddit

Unknown	2024-01-06 09:31:59	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18zwd1v/chess_puzzle_for_scavenger_hunt_does_it_make_sense/	Dear chess community, I need your help. I want to create a puzzle for my chess-loving friend but I've never played chess. ChatGPT has helped me, can you check if the puzzle makes sense? (Please don't care about language, it will be in another language anyway.) Also, how could I get a 4-digit-code in the end? A king ruled over the magical land of [city] whose destiny was determined by the pieces on an ancient chessboard. His queen, a noble and wise woman, proudly sat by his side. However, the kingdom was in danger, and the king called his loyal horse-riding knights to gather and protect the land. The knights, with their shiny armor, stood ready to fend off attacks from enemy pieces. Yet, tall towers, proud and majestic, formed the defensive line. Only with the correct positioning of the soldiers could the kingdom be saved. The story contains the keys to position the chess pieces on the board. Pay attention to the hierarchy and roles of the pieces to discover the magical pattern that opens the doors to the next puzzle. Solution: The king ruled over the land - Place the white king on the square e1. The queen, a noble and wise woman, proudly sat by his side - Place the white queen on the square d1. The loyal knights on horseback - Place the white knights on squares b1 and g1. Tall towers, proud and majestic, formed the defensive line - Place the white rooks on squares a1 and h1. The soldiers, ready to fend off attacks from enemy pieces - Place the white pawns on squares a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2.	2.0	t3_18zwd1v	reddit

Often this pays off greatly for them, likely because their opponents don't know the proper moves. I've thus been wondering if the titled Tuesday champions playing like this, has led to someone developing serious theory for these flank pawn pushes? My instinct would be to play principaled in these situations, but with engine analysis there could be better ways to ask the questionable moves what their purposes are. Historically I guess that these moves have not seen much theory, since noone would deign to play them, but most GMs can be fairly certain to see one of these four moves when meeting the top players online, and I guess that would be enough to warrant some theory for the master players? I don't think I've ever seen an opening book or course on these moves, so does anyone know if that has been created recently? I'm not necessarily interested in playing these moves, but if is an area with highly underdeveloped theory, it seems like the perfect place for Carlsen and Hikaru to get openings named after themselves?"	13.0	t3_18ynp1f	reddit		
238	Worst Chess Bot?	Unknown	2024-01-06 04:05:02	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18zqyoe/worst_chess_bot/	A lot of the “worst” chess bots I see are bots like Martin which play the move that give its opponent the best *winning* move. Have there been any bots which aim to maximise the value of the worst move the opponent can play? The idea would be to play moves that force the opposition into a winning position, rather than play moves that allow opponents to take winning positions. I feel like this would be a “worse” bot than Martin as it would eventually coerce Martin into taking pieces. An example might be forcing the king into a position where the only legal move is to take a rook, or deliver a discovered checkmate etc. An anti-stockfish :)	1.0	t3_18zqyoe	reddit

Since the very beginning of computer science, the challenge of being able to program a computer capable of playing chess and beating humans has been alive and used both as a mark to measure hardware/software progresses and as an ongoing programming challenge leading to numerous discoveries. In the early days of computer science it was a topic for specialists. But as computers were democratized, and the strength of chess engines began to increase, chess players started to appropriate to themselves these new tools. We show how these interactions between the world of chess and information technologies have been herald of broader social impacts of information technologies. The game of chess, and more broadly the world of chess (chess players, literature, computer softwares and websites dedicated to chess, etc.), turns out to be a surprisingly and particularly sharp indicator of the changes induced in our everyday life by the information technologies. Moreover, in the same way that chess is a modelization of war that captures the raw features of strategic thinking, chess world can be seen as small society making the study of the information technologies impact easier to analyze and to grasp.			arxiv	[]	1.0

The only difference with respect to the classical variant of Chess-game is that each rook after its having been captured by enemy chess piece in the proccess of gaming is not to be eliminated from the current game, but this rook is assumed being under virtual repairing during next N-steps (the required number of N is discussed in the current research). Then afterwards, such rook will be introduced in game again during maximal N-steps if only the chessboard square (on which it was captured previously) has not been occupied at previous step. In this case, Phoenix-Chess can be classified as game without predictable horizon of planning, so this kind of game should be considered as Chess-like games with incomplete information.			arxiv	['Millana Ershkova']	4.0

The contributions of this research are three-fold: we build and put forward both a classifier which extracts commentary describing the quality of Chess moves in vast commentary datasets, and a Sentiment Analysis model trained on Chess commentary to accurately predict the quality of said moves, to then use those predictions to evaluate the optimal next move of a Chess agent. Both classifiers achieve over 90 % classification accuracy. Lastly, we present a Chess engine, SentiMATE, which evaluates Chess moves based on a pre-trained sentiment evaluation function. Our results exhibit strong evidence to support our initial hypothesis - ""Can Natural Language Processing be used to train a novel and sample efficient evaluation function in Chess Engines?"" - as we integrate our evaluation function into modern Chess engines and play against agents with traditional Chess move evaluation functions, beating both random agents and a DeepChess implementation at a level-one search depth - representing the number of moves a traditional Chess agent (employing the alpha-beta search algorithm) looks ahead in order to evaluate a given chess state."			arxiv	['Isaac Bentata Chocron', 'Nicholas McCarthy']	6.0

257	Large-scale Analysis of Chess Games with Chess Engines: A Preliminary Report	Mathieu Acher	2016-04-28 08:37:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04186v1	The strength of chess engines together with the availability of numerous chess games have attracted the attention of chess players, data scientists, and researchers during the last decades. State-of-the-art engines now provide an authoritative judgement that can be used in many applications like cheating detection, intrinsic ratings computation, skill assessment, or the study of human decision-making. A key issue for the research community is to gather a large dataset of chess games together with the judgement of chess engines. Unfortunately the analysis of each move takes lots of times. In this paper, we report our effort to analyse almost 5 millions chess games with a computing grid. During summer 2015, we processed 270 millions unique played positions using the Stockfish engine with a quite high depth (20). We populated a database of 1+ tera-octets of chess evaluations, representing an estimated time of 50 years of computation on a single machine. Our effort is a first step towards the replication of research results, the supply of open data and procedures for exploring new directions, and the investigation of software engineering/scalability issues when computing billions of moves.			arxiv	['François Esnault']	8.0
258	Augmented Reality Chess Analyzer (ARChessAnalyzer): In-Device Inference of Physical Chess Game Positions through Board Segmentation and Piece Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network	Anav Mehta	2020-08-18 20:05:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01649v1	Chess game position analysis is important in improving ones game. It requires entry of moves into a chess engine which is, cumbersome and error prone. We present ARChessAnalyzer, a complete pipeline from live image capture of a physical chess game, to board and piece recognition, to move analysis and finally to Augmented Reality (AR) overlay of the chess diagram position and move on the physical board. ARChessAnalyzer is like a scene analyzer - it uses an ensemble of traditional image and vision techniques to segment the scene (ie the chess game) and uses Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict the segmented pieces and combine it together to analyze the game. This paper advances the state of the art in the first of its kind end to end integration of robust detection and segmentation of the board, chess piece detection using the fine-tuned AlexNet CNN and chess engine analyzer in a handheld device app. The accuracy of the entire chess position prediction pipeline is 93.45\% and takes 3-4.5sec from live capture to AR overlay. We also validated our hypothesis that ARChessAnalyzer, is faster at analysis than manual entry for all board positions for valid outcomes. Our hope is that the instantaneous feedback this app provides will help chess learners worldwide at all levels improve their game.			arxiv	[]	9.0
259	Learning to Play Chess from Textbooks (LEAP): a Corpus for Evaluating Chess Moves based on Sentiment Analysis	Haifa Alrdahi	2023-10-31 08:26:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20260v1	Learning chess strategies has been investigated widely, with most studies focussing on learning from previous games using search algorithms. Chess textbooks encapsulate grandmaster knowledge, explain playing strategies and require a smaller search space compared to traditional chess agents. This paper examines chess textbooks as a new knowledge source for enabling machines to learn how to play chess -- a resource that has not been explored previously. We developed the LEAP corpus, a first and new heterogeneous dataset with structured (chess move notations and board states) and unstructured data (textual descriptions) collected from a chess textbook containing 1164 sentences discussing strategic moves from 91 games. We firstly labelled the sentences based on their relevance, i.e., whether they are discussing a move. Each relevant sentence was then labelled according to its sentiment towards the described move. We performed empirical experiments that assess the performance of various transformer-based baseline models for sentiment analysis. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of employing transformer-based sentiment analysis models for evaluating chess moves, with the best performing model obtaining a weighted micro F_1 score of 68%. Finally, we synthesised the LEAP corpus to create a larger dataset, which can be used as a solution to the limited textual resource in the chess domain.			arxiv	['Riza Batista-Navarro']	10.0

261	Transfinite game values in infinite chess	C. D. A. Evans	2013-02-18 18:14:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4377v2	We investigate the transfinite game values arising in infinite chess, providing both upper and lower bounds on the supremum of these values---the omega one of chess---with two senses depending on whether one considers only finite positions or also positions with infinitely many pieces. For lower bounds, we present specific infinite positions with transfinite game values of omega, omega^2, omega^2 times k, and omega^3. By embedding trees into chess, we show that there is a computable infinite chess position that is a win for white if the players are required to play according to a deterministic computable strategy, but which is a draw without that restriction. Finally, we prove that every countable ordinal arises as the game value of a position in infinite three-dimensional chess, and consequently the omega one of infinite three-dimensional chess is as large as it can be, namely, true omega one.			arxiv	['Joel David Hamkins']	12.0
262	Quantifying the complexity and similarity of chess openings using online chess community data	Giordano De Marzo	2022-06-28 22:43:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14312v2	"Hundreds of years after its creation, the game of chess is still widely played worldwide. Opening Theory is one of the pillars of chess and requires years of study to be mastered. Here we exploit the ""wisdom of the crowd"" in an online chess platform to answer questions that, traditionally, only chess experts could tackle. We first define the relatedness network of chess openings that quantifies how similar two openings are to play. In this network, we spot communities of nodes corresponding to the most common opening choices and their mutual relationships, information which is hard to obtain from the existing classification of openings. Moreover, we use the relatedness network to forecast the future openings players will start to play and we back-test these predictions, obtaining performances considerably higher than those of a random predictor. Finally, we use the Economic Fitness and Complexity algorithm to measure how difficult to play openings are and how skilled in openings players are. This study not only gives a new perspective on chess analysis but also opens the possibility of suggesting personalized opening recommendations using complex network theory."			arxiv	['Vito DP Servedio']	13.0
263	Chess Pure Strategies are Probably Chaotic	M. Chaves	1998-08-21 19:13:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9808001v1	It is odd that chess grandmasters often disagree in their analysis of positions, sometimes even of simple ones, and that a grandmaster can hold his own against an powerful analytic machine such as Deep Blue. The fact that there must exist pure winning strategies for chess is used to construct a control strategy function. It is then shown that chess strategy is equivalent to an autonomous system of differential equations, and conjectured that the system is chaotic. If true the conjecture would explain the forenamed peculiarities and would also imply that there cannot exist a static evaluator for chess.			arxiv	[]	14.0

In this paper the `Chess-board Extraction by Subtraction and Summation' (ChESS) feature detector, designed to exclusively respond to chess-board vertices, is presented. The method proposed is robust against noise, poor lighting and poor contrast, requires no prior knowledge of the extent of the chess-board pattern, is computationally very efficient, and provides a strength measure of detected features. Such a detector has significant application both in the key field of camera calibration, as well as in Structured Light 3D reconstruction. Evidence is presented showing its robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in comparison to other commonly used detectors both under simulation and in experimental 3D reconstruction of flat plate and cylindrical objects			arxiv	['Joan Lasenby']	16.0
266	Innovation and Nested Preferential Growth in Chess Playing Behavior	Juan I. Perotti	2013-09-02 09:29:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0336v2	Complexity develops via the incorporation of innovative properties. Chess is one of the most complex strategy games, where expert contenders exercise decision making by imitating old games or introducing innovations. In this work, we study innovation in chess by analyzing how different move sequences are played at the population level. It is found that the probability of exploring a new or innovative move decreases as a power law with the frequency of the preceding move sequence. Chess players also exploit already known move sequences according to their frequencies, following a preferential growth mechanism. Furthermore, innovation in chess exhibits Heaps' law suggesting similarities with the process of vocabulary growth. We propose a robust generative mechanism based on nested Yule-Simon preferential growth processes that reproduces the empirical observations. These results, supporting the self-similar nature of innovations in chess are important in the context of decision making in a competitive scenario, and extend the scope of relevant findings recently discovered regarding the emergence of Zipf's law in chess.			arxiv	['Hang-Hyun Jo', 'Ana L.

Without any a priori knowledge, in particular without any knowledge regarding the rules of chess, a deep neural network is trained using a combination of unsupervised pretraining and supervised training. The unsupervised training extracts high level features from a given position, and the supervised training learns to compare two chess positions and select the more favorable one. The training relies entirely on datasets of several million chess games, and no further domain specific knowledge is incorporated. The experiments show that the resulting neural network (referred to as DeepChess) is on a par with state-of-the-art chess playing programs, which have been developed through many years of manual feature selection and tuning. DeepChess is the first end-to-end machine learning-based method that results in a grandmaster-level chess playing performance.			arxiv	['Nathan S. Netanyahu', 'Lior Wolf']	18.0
268	Information based explanation methods for deep learning agents -- with applications on large open-source chess models	Patrik Hammersborg	2023-09-18 12:08:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09702v1	With large chess-playing neural network models like AlphaZero contesting the state of the art within the world of computerised chess, two challenges present themselves: The question of how to explain the domain knowledge internalised by such models, and the problem that such models are not made openly available. This work presents the re-implementation of the concept detection methodology applied to AlphaZero in McGrath et al. (2022), by using large, open-source chess models with comparable performance. We obtain results similar to those achieved on AlphaZero, while relying solely on open-source resources. We also present a novel explainable AI (XAI) method, which is guaranteed to highlight exhaustively and exclusively the information used by the explained model. This method generates visual explanations tailored to domains characterised by discrete input spaces, as is the case for chess. Our presented method has the desirable property of controlling the information flow between any input vector and the given model, which in turn provides strict guarantees regarding what information is used by the trained model during inference. We demonstrate the viability of our method by applying it to standard 8x8 chess, using large open-source chess models.			arxiv	['Inga Strümke']	19.0
269	End-to-End Chess Recognition	Athanasios Masouris	2023-10-06 08:30:20	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04086v3	Chess recognition is the task of extracting the chess piece configuration from a chessboard image. Current approaches use a pipeline of separate, independent, modules such as chessboard detection, square localization, and piece classification. Instead, we follow the deep learning philosophy and explore an end-to-end approach to directly predict the configuration from the image, thus avoiding the error accumulation of the sequential approaches and eliminating the need for intermediate annotations. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset, Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), that consists of 10,800 real photographs and their corresponding annotations. In contrast to existing datasets that are synthetically rendered and have only limited angles, ChessReD has photographs captured from various angles using smartphone cameras; a sensor choice made to ensure real-world applicability. Our approach in chess recognition on the introduced challenging benchmark dataset outperforms related approaches, successfully recognizing the chess pieces' configuration in 15.26% of ChessReD's test images. This accuracy may seem low, but it is ~7x better than the current state-of-the-art and reflects the difficulty of the problem.

270	Assessing Game Balance with AlphaZero: Exploring Alternative Rule Sets in Chess	Nenad Tomašev	2020-09-09 15:49:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04374v2	It is non-trivial to design engaging and balanced sets of game rules. Modern chess has evolved over centuries, but without a similar recourse to history, the consequences of rule changes to game dynamics are difficult to predict. AlphaZero provides an alternative in silico means of game balance assessment. It is a system that can learn near-optimal strategies for any rule set from scratch, without any human supervision, by continually learning from its own experience. In this study we use AlphaZero to creatively explore and design new chess variants. There is growing interest in chess variants like Fischer Random Chess, because of classical chess's voluminous opening theory, the high percentage of draws in professional play, and the non-negligible number of games that end while both players are still in their home preparation. We compare nine other variants that involve atomic changes to the rules of chess. The changes allow for novel strategic and tactical patterns to emerge, while keeping the games close to the original. By learning near-optimal strategies for each variant with AlphaZero, we determine what games between strong human players might look like if these variants were adopted. Qualitatively, several variants are very dynamic. An analytic comparison show that pieces are valued differently between variants, and that some variants are more decisive than classical chess. Our findings demonstrate the rich possibilities that lie beyond the rules of modern chess.			arxiv	['Ulrich Paquet', 'Demis Hassabis', 'Vladimir Kramnik']	21.0

Generalizing a known result on so-called Richman games, we show that for a natural class of games including bidding chess, each position can be assigned rational upper and lower values corresponding to the limit proportion of money that Black (say) needs in order to force a win and to avoid losing, respectively. We have computed these values for all three-piece endgames, and in all cases, the upper and lower values coincide. Already with three pieces, the game is quite complex, and the values have denominators of up to 138 digits.			arxiv	['Johan Wästlund']	29.0

The reflexmate is a derivative of the selfmate in which White compels Black to checkmate with the added condition that if either player can checkmate, they must do that (when this condition applies only to Black, it is a semi-reflexmate).

283	The Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate: A New Approach to Computational Creativity	Azlan Iqbal	2015-07-25 03:00:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07058v2	We introduce a new artificial intelligence (AI) approach called, the 'Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate' (DSNS). It uses selected attributes from objects in various domains (e.g. chess problems, classical music, renowned artworks) and recombines them in such a way as to generate new attributes that can then, in principle, be used to create novel objects of creative value to humans relating to any one of the source domains. This allows some of the burden of creative content generation to be passed from humans to machines. The approach was tested in the domain of chess problem composition. We used it to automatically compose numerous sets of chess problems based on attributes extracted and recombined from chess problems and tournament games by humans, renowned paintings, computer-evolved abstract art, photographs of people, and classical music tracks. The quality of these generated chess problems was then assessed automatically using an existing and experimentally-validated computational chess aesthetics model. They were also assessed by human experts in the domain. The results suggest that attributes collected and recombined from chess and other domains using the DSNS approach can indeed be used to automatically generate chess problems of reasonably high aesthetic quality. In particular, a low quality chess source (i.e. tournament game sequences between weak players) used in combination with actual photographs of people was able to produce three-move chess problems of comparable quality or better to those generated using a high quality chess source (i.e. published compositions by human experts), and more efficiently as well. Why information from a foreign domain can be integrated and functional in this way remains an open question for now. The DSNS approach is, in principle, scalable and applicable to any domain in which objects have attributes that can be represented using real numbers.			arxiv	['Matej Guid', 'Simon Colton', 'Jana Krivec', 'Shazril Azman', 'Boshra Haghighi']	34.0

The visual attention model described in this article has been created to generate saliency maps that capture hierarchical and spatial features of chessboard, in order to predict the probability fixation for individual pixels Using a skip-layer architecture of an autoencoder, with a unified decoder, we are able to use multiscale features to predict saliency of part of the board at different scales, showing multiple relations between pieces. We have used scan path and fixation data from players engaged in solving chess problems, to compute 6600 saliency maps associated to the corresponding chess piece configurations. This corpus is completed with synthetically generated data from actual games gathered from an online chess platform. Experiments realized using both scan-paths from chess players and the CAT2000 saliency dataset of natural images, highlights several results. Deep features, pretrained on natural images, were found to be helpful in training visual attention prediction for chess. The proposed neural network architecture is able to generate meaningful saliency maps on unseen chess configurations with good scores on standard metrics. This work provides a baseline for future work on visual attention prediction in similar contexts.			arxiv	['Thomas Guntz', 'James Crowley', 'Dominique Vaufreydaz']	36.0

For chess, which has a very rich opening theory, large databases of high-quality games can be used as the basis of an opening book, from which statistics relating to move choices from given positions can be collected. In order to find out whether the opening books used by modern chess engines in machine versus machine competitions are ``comparable'' to those used by chess players in human versus human competitions, we carried out analysis on 26 test positions using statistics from two opening books one compiled from humans' games and the other from machines' games. Our analysis using several nonparametric measures, shows that, overall, there is a strong association between humans' and machines' choices of opening moves when using a book to guide their choices.			arxiv	['Judit Bar-Ilan']	37.0

289	Complexity of Retrograde and Helpmate Chess Problems: Even Cooperative Chess is Hard	Josh Brunner	2020-10-19 07:32:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09271v1	"We prove PSPACE-completeness of two classic types of Chess problems when generalized to n-by-n boards. A ""retrograde"" problem asks whether it is possible for a position to be reached from a natural starting position, i.e., whether the position is ""valid"" or ""legal"" or ""reachable"". Most real-world retrograde Chess problems ask for the last few moves of such a sequence; we analyze the decision question which gets at the existence of an exponentially long move sequence. A ""helpmate"" problem asks whether it is possible for a player to become checkmated by any sequence of moves from a given position. A helpmate problem is essentially a cooperative form of Chess, where both players work together to cause a particular player to win; it also arises in regular Chess games, where a player who runs out of time (flags) loses only if they could ever possibly be checkmated from the current position (i.e., the helpmate problem has a solution). Our PSPACE-hardness reductions are from a variant of a puzzle game called Subway Shuffle."			arxiv	['Erik D. Demaine', 'Dylan Hendrickson', 'Julian Wellman']	40.0
290	Intransitively winning chess players positions	Alexander Poddiakov	2022-12-11 05:55:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11069v1	Positions of chess players in intransitive (rock-paper-scissors) relations are considered. Namely, position A of White is preferable (it should be chosen if choice is possible) to position B of Black, position B of Black is preferable to position C of White, position C of White is preferable to position D of Black, but position D of Black is preferable to position A of White. Intransitivity of winningness of positions of chess players is considered to be a consequence of complexity of the chess environment -- in contrast with simpler games with transitive positions only. The space of relations between winningness of positions of chess players is non-Euclidean. The Zermelo-von Neumann theorem is complemented by statements about possibility vs. impossibility of building pure winning strategies based on the assumption of transitivity of positions of chess players. Questions about the possibility of intransitive positions of players in other positional games are raised.			arxiv	[]	41.0
291	The mate-in-n problem of infinite chess is decidable	Dan Brumleve	2012-01-26 18:26:57	http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5597v4	Infinite chess is chess played on an infinite edgeless chessboard. The familiar chess pieces move about according to their usual chess rules, and each player strives to place the opposing king into checkmate. The mate-in-n problem of infinite chess is the problem of determining whether a designated player can force a win from a given finite position in at most n moves. A naive formulation of this problem leads to assertions of high arithmetic complexity with 2n alternating quantifiers---there is a move for white, such that for every black reply, there is a counter-move for white, and so on. In such a formulation, the problem does not appear to be decidable; and one cannot expect to search an infinitely branching game tree even to finite depth. Nevertheless, the main theorem of this article, confirming a conjecture of the first author and C. D. A. Evans, establishes that the mate-in-n problem of infinite chess is computably decidable, uniformly in the position and in n. Furthermore, there is a computable strategy for optimal play from such mate-in-n positions. The proof proceeds by showing that the mate-in-n problem is expressible in what we call the first-order structure of chess, which we prove (in the relevant fragment) is an automatic structure, whose theory is therefore decidable. Indeed, it is definable in Presburger arithmetic. Unfortunately, this resolution of the mate-in-n problem does not appear to settle the decidability of the more general winning-position problem, the problem of determining whether a designated player has a winning strategy from a given position, since a position may admit a winning strategy without any bound on the number of moves required. This issue is connected with transfinite game values in infinite chess, and the exact value of the omega one of chess is not known.			arxiv	['Joel David Hamkins', 'Philipp Schlicht']	42.0
292	Measuring the Non-Transitivity in Chess	Ricky Sanjaya	2021-10-22 12:15:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11737v1	It has long been believed that Chess is the \emph{Drosophila} of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Studying Chess can productively provide valid knowledge about complex systems. Although remarkable progress has been made on solving Chess, the geometrical landscape of Chess in the strategy space is still mysterious. Judging on AI-generated strategies, researchers hypothesised that the strategy space of Chess possesses a spinning top geometry, with the upright axis representing the \emph{transitive} dimension (e.g., A beats B, B beats C, A beats C), and the radial axis representing the \emph{non-transitive} dimension (e.g., A beats B, B beats C, C beats A). However, it is unclear whether such a hypothesis holds for real-world strategies. In this paper, we quantify the non-transitivity in Chess through real-world data from human players. Specifically, we performed two ways of non-transitivity quantifications -- Nash Clustering and counting the number of Rock-Paper-Scissor cycles -- on over one billion match data from Lichess and FICS. Our findings positively indicate that the strategy space occupied by real-world Chess strategies demonstrates a spinning top geometry, and more importantly, there exists a strong connection between the degree of non-transitivity and the progression of a Chess player's rating. In particular, high degrees of non-transitivity tend to prevent human players from making progress on their Elo rating, whereas progressions are easier to make at the level of ratings where the degree of non-transitivity is lower. Additionally, we also investigate the implication of the degree of non-transitivity for population-based training methods. By considering \emph{fixed-memory Fictitious Play} as a proxy, we reach the conclusion that maintaining large-size and diverse populations of strategies is imperative to training effective AI agents in solving Chess types of games.			arxiv	['Jun Wang', 'Yaodong Yang']	43.0
293	Fairer Chess: A Reversal of Two Opening Moves in Chess Creates Balance Between White and Black	Steven J. Brams	2021-08-05 12:14:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02547v2	Unlike tic-tac-toe or checkers, in which optimal play leads to a draw, it is not known whether optimal play in chess ends in a win for White, a win for Black, or a draw. But after White moves first in chess, if Black has a double move followed by a double move of White and then alternating play, play is more balanced because White does not always tie or lead in moves. Symbolically, Balanced Alternation gives the following move sequence: After White's (W) initial move, first Black (B) and then White each have two moves in a row (BBWW), followed by the alternating sequence, beginning with W, which altogether can be written as WB/BW/WB/WB/WB... (the slashes separate alternating pairs of moves). Except for reversal of the 3rd and 4th moves from WB to BW, this is the standard chess sequence. Because Balanced Alternation lies between the standard sequence, which favors White, and a comparable sequence that favors Black, it is highly likely to produce a draw with optimal play, rendering chess fairer. This conclusion is supported by a computer analysis of chess openings and how they would play out under Balanced Alternation.			arxiv	['Mehmet S. Ismail']	44.0
294	Determining Chess Game State From an Image	Georg Wölflein	2021-04-30 13:02:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14963v2	Identifying the configuration of chess pieces from an image of a chessboard is a problem in computer vision that has not yet been solved accurately. However, it is important for helping amateur chess players improve their games by facilitating automatic computer analysis without the overhead of manually entering the pieces. Current approaches are limited by the lack of large datasets and are not designed to adapt to unseen chess sets. This paper puts forth a new dataset synthesised from a 3D model that is an order of magnitude larger than existing ones. Trained on this dataset, a novel end-to-end chess recognition system is presented that combines traditional computer vision techniques with deep learning. It localises the chessboard using a RANSAC-based algorithm that computes a projective transformation of the board onto a regular grid. Using two convolutional neural networks, it then predicts an occupancy mask for the squares in the warped image and finally classifies the pieces. The described system achieves an error rate of 0.23% per square on the test set, 28 times better than the current state of the art. Further, a few-shot transfer learning approach is developed that is able to adapt the inference system to a previously unseen chess set using just two photos of the starting position, obtaining a per-square accuracy of 99.83% on images of that new chess set. The code, dataset, and trained models are made available online.			arxiv	['Ognjen Arandjelović']	45.0
295	Neural Networks for Chess	Dominik Klein	2022-09-03 22:17:16	http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01506v1	AlphaZero, Leela Chess Zero and Stockfish NNUE revolutionized Computer Chess. This book gives a complete introduction into the technical inner workings of such engines. The book is split into four main chapters -- excluding chapter 1 (introduction) and chapter 6 (conclusion): Chapter 2 introduces neural networks and covers all the basic building blocks that are used to build deep networks such as those used by AlphaZero. Contents include the perceptron, back-propagation and gradient descent, classification, regression, multilayer perceptron, vectorization techniques, convolutional networks, squeeze and excitation networks, fully connected networks, batch normalization and rectified linear units, residual layers, overfitting and underfitting. Chapter 3 introduces classical search techniques used for chess engines as well as those used by AlphaZero. Contents include minimax, alpha-beta search, and Monte Carlo tree search. Chapter 4 shows how modern chess engines are designed. Aside from the ground-breaking AlphaGo, AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero we cover Leela Chess Zero, Fat Fritz, Fat Fritz 2 and Efficiently Updatable Neural Networks (NNUE) as well as Maia. Chapter 5 is about implementing a miniaturized AlphaZero. Hexapawn, a minimalistic version of chess, is used as an example for that. Hexapawn is solved by minimax search and training positions for supervised learning are generated. Then as a comparison, an AlphaZero-like training loop is implemented where training is done via self-play combined with reinforcement learning. Finally, AlphaZero-like training and supervised training are compared.			arxiv	[]	46.0
296	A New Approach to Draw Detection by Move Repetition in Computer Chess Programming	Vladan Vuckovic	2004-06-21 13:42:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0406038v1	We will try to tackle both the theoretical and practical aspects of a very important problem in chess programming as stated in the title of this article - the issue of draw detection by move repetition. The standard approach that has so far been employed in most chess programs is based on utilising positional matrices in original and compressed format as well as on the implementation of the so-called bitboard format. The new approach that we will be trying to introduce is based on using variant strings generated by the search algorithm (searcher) during the tree expansion in decision making. We hope to prove that this approach is more efficient than the standard treatment of the issue, especially in positions with few pieces (endgames). To illustrate what we have in mind a machine language routine that implements our theoretical assumptions is attached. The routine is part of the Axon chess program, developed by the authors. Axon, in its current incarnation, plays chess at master strength (ca. 2400-2450 Elo, based on both Axon vs computer programs and Axon vs human masters in over 3000 games altogether).			arxiv	['Djordje Vidanovic']	47.0
297	New directions in enumerative chess problems	Noam D. Elkies	2005-08-31 15:31:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0508645v1	Normally a chess problem must have a unique solution, and is deemed unsound even if there are alternatives that differ only in the order in which the same moves are played. In an enumerative chess problem, the set of moves in the solution is (usually) unique but the order is not, and the task is to count the feasible permutations via an isomorphic problem in enumerative combinatorics. Almost all enumerative chess problems have been ``series-movers'', in which one side plays an uninterrupted series of moves, unanswered except possibly for one move by the opponent at the end. This can be convenient for setting up enumeration problems, but we show that other problem genres also lend themselves to composing enumerative problems. Some of the resulting enumerations cannot be shown (or have not yet been shown) in series-movers. This article is based on a presentation given at the banquet in honor of Richard Stanley's 60th birthday, and is dedicated to Stanley on this occasion.			arxiv	[]	48.0
298	Chess, Chance and Conspiracy	Mark R. Segal	2007-08-29 14:06:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.3961v1	Chess and chance are seemingly strange bedfellows. Luck and/or randomness have no apparent role in move selection when the game is played at the highest levels. However, when competition is at the ultimate level, that of the World Chess Championship (WCC), chess and conspiracy are not strange bedfellows, there being a long and colorful history of accusations levied between participants. One such accusation, frequently repeated, was that all the games in the 1985 WCC (Karpov vs Kasparov) were fixed and prearranged move by move. That this claim was advanced by a former World Champion, Bobby Fischer, argues that it ought be investigated. That the only published, concrete basis for this claim consists of an observed run of particular moves, allows this investigation to be performed using probabilistic and statistical methods. In particular, we employ imbedded finite Markov chains to evaluate run statistic distributions. Further, we demonstrate how both chess computers and game data bases can be brought to bear on the problem.			arxiv	[]	49.0

The library is based on a flexible and efficient expansion in terms of Chebyshev polynomials and presently features the calculation of the density matrix, the calculation of matrix powers for arbitrary powers, and the extraction of eigenvalues in a selected interval. CheSS is able to exploit the sparsity of the matrices and scales linearly with respect to the number of nonzero entries, making it well-suited for large-scale calculations. The approach is particularly adapted for setups leading to small spectral widths of the involved matrices and outperforms alternative methods in this regime. By coupling CheSS to the DFT code BigDFT, we show that such a favorable setup is indeed possible in practice. In addition, the approach based on Chebyshev polynomials can be massively parallelized, and CheSS exhibits excellent scaling up to thousands of cores even for relatively small matrix sizes."			arxiv	['William Dawson', 'Michael Wagner', 'Damien Caliste', 'Takahito Nakajima', 'Luigi Genovese']	50.0

Playing chess is one such task. It was one of the first games which was `solved' using AI. With the advent of deep learning, chess playing agents can surpass human ability with relative ease. However algorithms using deep learning must learn millions of parameters. This work looks at the game of chess through the lens of genetic algorithms. We train a genetic player from scratch using only a handful of learnable parameters. We use Multi-Niche Crowding to optimize positional Value Tables (PVTs) which are used extensively in chess engines to evaluate the goodness of a position. With a very simple setup and after only 1000 generations of evolution, the player reaches the level of an International Master.			arxiv	['G Srinivasaraghavan']	51.0

This problem is of much interest for tournament organizers and amateur or professional players to broadcast their over-the-board (OTB) games online or analyze them using chess engines. Previous work has shown promising results, but the recognition accuracy and the latency of state-of-the-art techniques still need further enhancements to allow their practical and affordable deployment. We have investigated how to implement them on an Nvidia Jetson Nano single-board computer effectively. Our first contribution has been accelerating the chessboard's detection algorithm. Subsequently, we have analyzed different Convolutional Neural Networks for chess piece classification and how to map them efficiently on our embedded platform. Notably, we have implemented a functional framework that automatically digitizes a chess position from an image in less than 1 second, with 92% accuracy when classifying the pieces and 95% when detecting the board.			arxiv	['Alberto Antonio del Barrio García', 'Manuel Prieto Matías']	54.0

Prior work analyzes this puzzle for a single piece type when each piece is limited to make at most two capture moves (as in the Solo Chess puzzles on chess.com). By contrast, we study when each piece can make an unlimited number of capture moves. We show that any single piece type can be solved in polynomial time in a general model of piece types, while any two standard Chess piece types are NP-complete. We also analyze the restriction (as on chess.com) that one piece type is unique and must be the last surviving piece, showing that in this case some pairs of piece types become tractable while others remain hard.			arxiv	['Lily Chung', 'Michael Coulombe', 'Erik D.

Based on the typical number of moves required to transpose a given configuration of chess pieces into another, we conclude that the state space consists of several pockets between which transitions are rare. Skilled players explore an even smaller subset of positions that populate some of these pockets only very sparsely. These results suggest that the usual measures to estimate both, the size of the state space and the size of the tree of legal moves, are not unique indicators of the complexity of the game, but that topological considerations are equally important.			arxiv	['T.

Some features of the proposed method are illustrated by the results of the 18th European Team Chess Championship. The analysis is able to take into account the influence of different opponents and robust with respect to the scaling technique chosen.

The player would be uncertain which type of oracle it was interacting with. As the oracles would be vastly more intelligent than the player in the domain of chess, experience with these oracles might help us prepare for future artificial general intelligence oracles.			arxiv	['Roman Yampolskiy', 'Olle Haggstrom', 'Stuart Armstrong']	59.0

The task of counting the feasible permutations may be accomplished by solving an equivalent problem in enumerative combinatorics. Almost all such problems have been of a special type known as series movers.

311	A Popperian Falsification of Artificial Intelligence -- Lighthill Defended	Steven Meyer	2017-04-23 21:16:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08111v3	The area of computation called artificial intelligence (AI) is falsified by describing a previous 1972 falsification of AI by British mathematical physicist James Lighthill. How Lighthill's arguments continue to apply to current AI is explained. It is argued that AI should use the Popperian scientific method in which it is the duty of scientists to attempt to falsify theories and if theories are falsified to replace or modify them. The paper describes the Popperian method and discusses Paul Nurse's application of the method to cell biology that also involves questions of mechanism and behavior. It is shown how Lighthill's falsifying arguments especially combinatorial explosion continue to apply to modern AI. Various skeptical arguments against the assumptions of AI mostly by physicists especially against Hilbert's philosophical programme that defined knowledge and truth as provable formal sentences. John von Neumann's arguments from natural complexity against neural networks and evolutionary algorithms are discussed. Next the game of chess is discussed to show how modern chess experts have reacted to computer chess programs. It is shown that currently chess masters can defeat any chess program using Kasperov's arguments from his 1997 Deep Blue match and aftermath. The game of 'go' and climate models are discussed to show computer applications where combinatorial explosion may not apply. The paper concludes by advocating studying computation as Peter Naur's Dataology.			arxiv	[]	62.0

Aravind	2022-03-28 16:13:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14864v2	"We introduce a generalization of ""Solo Chess"", a single-player variant of the game that can be played on chess.com. The standard version of the game is played on a regular 8 x 8 chessboard by a single player, with only white pieces, using the following rules: every move must capture a piece, no piece may capture more than 2 times, and if there is a King on the board, it must be the final piece. The goal is to clear the board, i.e, make a sequence of captures after which only one piece is left. We generalize this game to unbounded boards with $n$ pieces, each of which have a given number of captures that they are permitted to make. We show that Generalized Solo Chess is NP-complete, even when it is played by only rooks that have at most two captures remaining. It also turns out to be NP-complete even when every piece is a queen with exactly two captures remaining in the initial configuration. In contrast, we show that solvable instances of Generalized Solo Chess can be completely characterized when the game is: a) played by rooks on a one-dimensional board, and b) played by pawns with two captures left on a 2D board. Inspired by Generalized Solo Chess, we also introduce the Graph Capture Game, which involves clearing a graph of tokens via captures along edges. This game subsumes Generalized Solo Chess played by knights. We show that the Graph Capture Game is NP-complete for undirected graphs and DAGs."			arxiv	['Neeldhara Misra', 'Harshil Mittal']	63.0

For example, to reduce staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, major tennis tournaments replaced human line judges with Hawk-Eye Live technology. AI is now ready to move beyond such mundane tasks, however. A case in point and a perfect application ground is chess. To reduce the growing incidence of draws, many elite tournaments have resorted to fast chess tiebreakers. However, these tiebreakers are vulnerable to strategic manipulation, e.g., in the last game of the 2018 World Chess Championship, Magnus Carlsen -- in a significantly advantageous position -- offered a draw to Fabiano Caruana (whom accepted the offer) to proceed to fast chess tiebreaks in which Carlsen had even better odds of winning the championship. By contrast, we prove that our AI-based method can serve as a judge to break ties without being vulnerable to such manipulation. It relies on measuring the difference between the evaluations of a player's actual move and the best move as deemed by a powerful chess engine. If there is a tie, the player with the higher quality measure wins the tiebreak. We generalize our method to all competitive sports and games in which AI's superiority is -- or can be -- established.			arxiv	['Mehmet S. Ismail']	64.0
314	Cultural transmission of move choice in chess	Egor Lappo	2023-02-21 00:25:41	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10375v3	The study of cultural evolution benefits from detailed analysis of cultural transmission in specific human domains. Chess provides a platform for understanding the transmission of knowledge due to its active community of players, precise behaviors, and long-term records of high-quality data. In this paper, we perform an analysis of chess in the context of cultural evolution, describing multiple cultural factors that affect move choice. We then build a population-level statistical model of move choice in chess, based on the Dirichlet-multinomial likelihood, to analyze cultural transmission over decades of recorded games played by leading players. For moves made in specific positions, we evaluate the relative effects of frequency-dependent bias, success bias, and prestige bias on the dynamics of move frequencies. We observe that negative frequency-dependent bias plays a role in the dynamics of certain moves, and that other moves are compatible with transmission under prestige bias or success bias. These apparent biases may reflect recent changes, namely the introduction of computer chess engines and online tournament broadcasts. Our analysis of chess provides insights into broader questions concerning how social learning biases affect cultural evolution.			arxiv	['Noah A. Rosenberg', 'Marcus W. Feldman']	65.0

Stockfish 14 NNUE -- an AI chess engine -- evaluates how efficient Karpov's sacrifices are. For comparative purposes, we provide a dataset on Karpov's Rook and Knight sacrifices to test whether Karpov achieves a similar level of accuracy. Our study has implications for human-AI interaction and how humans can better understand the strategies employed by black-box AI algorithms.

318	Optimal Dimensionality Reduction of Complex Dynamics: The Chess Game as Diffusion on a Free Energy Landscape	Sergei V. Krivov	2011-03-18 18:21:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3681v1	Dimensionality reduction is ubiquitous in analysis of complex dynamics. The conventional dimensionality reduction techniques, however, focus on reproducing the underlying configuration space, rather than the dynamics itself. The constructed low-dimensional space does not provide complete and accurate description of the dynamics. Here I describe how to perform dimensionality reduction while preserving the essential properties of the dynamics. The approach is illustrated by analyzing the chess game - the archetype of complex dynamics. A variable that provides complete and accurate description of chess dynamics is constructed. Winning probability is predicted by describing the game as a random walk on the free energy landscape associated with the variable. The approach suggests a possible way of obtaining a simple yet accurate description of many important complex phenomena. The analysis of the chess game shows that the approach can quantitatively describe the dynamics of processes where human decision-making plays a central role, e.g., financial and social dynamics.			arxiv	[]	69.0
319	Estimating Total Search Space Size for Specific Piece Sets in Chess	Azlan Iqbal	2018-02-27 07:35:55	http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00874v1	Automatic chess problem or puzzle composition typically involves generating and testing various different positions, sometimes using particular piece sets. Once a position has been generated, it is then usually tested for positional legality based on the game rules. However, it is useful to be able to estimate what the search space size for particular piece combinations is to begin with. So if a desirable chess problem was successfully generated by examining 'merely' 100,000 or so positions in a theoretical search space of about 100 billion, this would imply the composing approach used was quite viable and perhaps even impressive. In this article, I explain a method of calculating the size of this search space using a combinatorics and permutations approach. While the mathematics itself may already be established, a precise method and justification of applying it with regard to the chessboard and chess pieces has not been documented, to the best of our knowledge. Additionally, the method could serve as a useful starting point for further estimations of search space size which filter out positions for legality and rotation, depending on how the automatic composer is allowed to place pieces on the board (because this affects its total search space size).			arxiv	[]	70.0

We describe the design of an instrument for capturing and interpreting multimodal signals of humans engaged in solving challenging problems. We review results from a pilot experiment with human experts engaged in solving challenging problems in Chess that revealed an unexpected observation of rapid changes in emotion as players attempt to solve challenging problems. We propose a cognitive model that describes the process by which subjects select chess chunks for use in interpretation of the game situation and describe initial results from a second experiment designed to test this model.			arxiv	['James Crowley', 'Dominique Vaufreydaz', 'Raffaella Balzarini', 'Philippe Dessus']	71.0

Our results show that using an appropriate expert (or mentor), we can evolve a program that is on par with top tournament-playing chess programs, outperforming a two-time World Computer Chess Champion. This performance gain is achieved by evolving a program that mimics the behavior of a superior expert. The resulting evaluation function of the evolved program consists of a much smaller number of parameters than the expert's. The extended experimental results provided in this paper include a report of our successful participation in the 2008 World Computer Chess Championship. In principle, our expert-driven approach could be used in a wide range of problems for which appropriate experts are available.			arxiv	['Moshe Koppel', 'Nathan S. Netanyahu']	72.0

The evaluation function of the program is evolved by learning from databases of (human) grandmaster games. At first, the organisms are evolved to mimic the behavior of human grandmasters, and then these organisms are further improved upon by means of coevolution. The search mechanism is evolved by learning from tactical test suites. Our results show that the evolved program outperforms a two-time world computer chess champion and is at par with the other leading computer chess programs.			arxiv	['H.

323	A Computer Composes A Fabled Problem: Four Knights vs. Queen	Azlan Iqbal	2017-09-04 12:56:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00931v1	We explain how the prototype automatic chess problem composer, Chesthetica, successfully composed a rare and interesting chess problem using the new Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate (DSNS) computational creativity approach. This problem represents a greater challenge from a creative standpoint because the checkmate is not always clear and the method of winning even less so. Creating a decisive chess problem of this type without the aid of an omniscient 7-piece endgame tablebase (and one that also abides by several chess composition conventions) would therefore be a challenge for most human players and composers working on their own. The fact that a small computer with relatively low processing power and memory was sufficient to compose such a problem using the DSNS approach in just 10 days is therefore noteworthy. In this report we document the event and result in some detail. It lends additional credence to the DSNS as a viable new approach in the field of computational creativity. In particular, in areas where human-like creativity is required for targeted or specific problems with no clear path to the solution.			arxiv	[]	74.0

On one hand, the decision-making processes need to take into account many options. On the other hand, the design of the system's logical architecture must consider various dependability concerns such as safety, reliability, and security. Moreover, in case of high-assurance systems, the analysis of such concerns must be performed with rigorous methods. In this paper, we present the new development of CHESS, a cross-domain, model-driven, component-based, and open-source tool for the development of high-integrity systems. We focus on the new recently distributed version of CHESS, which supports extended model-based development and analyses for safety and security concerns. Finally, we present contributions of CHESS to several international research projects.			arxiv	['Silvia Mazzini', 'Pierluigi Pierini', 'Alberto Debiasi', 'Stefano Tonetta']	75.0
325	A Chain-Detection Algorithm for Two-Dimensional Grids	Paul Bonham	2016-10-12 01:34:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03573v1	We describe a general method of detecting valid chains or links of pieces on a two-dimensional grid. Specifically, using the example of the chess variant known as Switch-Side Chain-Chess (SSCC). Presently, no foolproof method of detecting such chains in any given chess position is known and existing graph theory, to our knowledge, is unable to fully address this problem either. We therefore propose a solution implemented and tested using the C++ programming language. We have been unable to find an incorrect result and therefore offer it as the most viable solution thus far to the chain-detection problem in this chess variant. The algorithm is also scalable, in principle, to areas beyond two-dimensional grids such as 3D analysis and molecular chemistry.			arxiv	['Azlan Iqbal']	76.0
326	Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm	David Silver	2017-12-05 18:45:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815v1	The game of chess is the most widely-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. In contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go, by tabula rasa reinforcement learning from games of self-play. In this paper, we generalise this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve, tabula rasa, superhuman performance in many challenging domains. Starting from random play, and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case.			arxiv	['Thomas Hubert', 'Julian Schrittwieser', 'Ioannis Antonoglou', 'Matthew Lai', 'Arthur Guez', 'Marc Lanctot', 'Laurent Sifre', 'Dharshan Kumaran', 'Thore Graepel', 'Timothy Lillicrap', 'Karen Simonyan', 'Demis Hassabis']	77.0
327	Playing Chess with Limited Look Ahead	Arman Maesumi	2020-07-04 16:02:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02130v1	We have seen numerous machine learning methods tackle the game of chess over the years. However, one common element in these works is the necessity of a finely optimized look ahead algorithm. The particular interest of this research lies with creating a chess engine that is highly capable, but restricted in its look ahead depth. We train a deep neural network to serve as a static evaluation function, which is accompanied by a relatively simple look ahead algorithm. We show that our static evaluation function has encoded some semblance of look ahead knowledge, and is comparable to classical evaluation functions. The strength of our chess engine is assessed by comparing its proposed moves against those proposed by Stockfish. We show that, despite strict restrictions on look ahead depth, our engine recommends moves of equal strength in roughly $83\%$ of our sample positions.			arxiv	[]	78.0
328	The Chess Transformer: Mastering Play using Generative Language Models	David Noever	2020-08-02 18:04:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04057v5	This work demonstrates that natural language transformers can support more generic strategic modeling, particularly for text-archived games. In addition to learning natural language skills, the abstract transformer architecture can generate meaningful moves on a chessboard. With further fine-tuning, the transformer learns complex gameplay by training on 2.8 million chess games in Portable Game Notation. After 30,000 training steps, OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-2) optimizes weights for 774 million parameters. This fine-tuned Chess Transformer generates plausible strategies and displays game formations identifiable as classic openings, such as English or the Slav Exchange. Finally, in live play, the novel model demonstrates a human-to-transformer interface that correctly filters illegal moves and provides a novel method to challenge the transformer's chess strategies. We anticipate future work will build on this transformer's promise, particularly in other strategy games where features can capture the underlying complex rule syntax from simple but expressive player annotations.			arxiv	['Matt Ciolino', 'Josh Kalin']	79.0
329	Chess as a Testbed for Language Model State Tracking	Shubham Toshniwal	2021-02-26 01:16:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13249v2	"Transformer language models have made tremendous strides in natural language understanding tasks. However, the complexity of natural language makes it challenging to ascertain how accurately these models are tracking the world state underlying the text. Motivated by this issue, we consider the task of language modeling for the game of chess. Unlike natural language, chess notations describe a simple, constrained, and deterministic domain. Moreover, we observe that the appropriate choice of chess notation allows for directly probing the world state, without requiring any additional probing-related machinery. We find that: (a) With enough training data, transformer language models can learn to track pieces and predict legal moves with high accuracy when trained solely on move sequences. (b) For small training sets providing access to board state information during training can yield significant improvements. (c) The success of transformer language models is dependent on access to the entire game history i.e. ""full attention"". Approximating this full attention results in a significant performance drop. We propose this testbed as a benchmark for future work on the development and analysis of transformer language models."			arxiv	['Sam Wiseman', 'Karen Livescu', 'Kevin Gimpel']	80.0

We find that they can serve as a tool for testing machine ability as well. Two of the leading chess engines, Stockfish and Leela Chess Zero (LCZero), employ significantly different methods during play. We use Plaskett's Puzzle, a famous endgame study from the late 1970s, to compare the two engines. Our experiments show that Stockfish outperforms LCZero on the puzzle. We examine the algorithmic differences between the engines and use our observations as a basis for carefully interpreting the test results. Drawing inspiration from how humans solve chess problems, we ask whether machines can possess a form of imagination. On the theoretical side, we describe how Bellman's equation may be applied to optimize the probability of winning. To conclude, we discuss the implications of our work on artificial intelligence (AI) and artificial general intelligence (AGI), suggesting possible avenues for future research.			arxiv	['Nick Polson', 'Alex Turk']	81.0
331	Acquisition of Chess Knowledge in AlphaZero	Thomas McGrath	2021-11-17 17:46:19	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09259v3	What is learned by sophisticated neural network agents such as AlphaZero? This question is of both scientific and practical interest. If the representations of strong neural networks bear no resemblance to human concepts, our ability to understand faithful explanations of their decisions will be restricted, ultimately limiting what we can achieve with neural network interpretability. In this work we provide evidence that human knowledge is acquired by the AlphaZero neural network as it trains on the game of chess. By probing for a broad range of human chess concepts we show when and where these concepts are represented in the AlphaZero network. We also provide a behavioural analysis focusing on opening play, including qualitative analysis from chess Grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik. Finally, we carry out a preliminary investigation looking at the low-level details of AlphaZero's representations, and make the resulting behavioural and representational analyses available online.			arxiv	['Andrei Kapishnikov', 'Nenad Tomašev', 'Adam Pearce', 'Demis Hassabis', 'Been Kim', 'Ulrich Paquet', 'Vladimir Kramnik']	82.0
332	Chess tableaux, powers of two and affine Lie algebras	Antoine Labelle	2022-11-19 04:26:10	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10584v3	Chess tableaux are a special kind of standard Young tableaux where, in the chessboard coloring of the Young diagram, even numbers always appear in white cells and odd numbers in black cells. If, for $\lambda$ a partition of $n$, $\text{Chess}(\lambda)$ denotes the number of chess tableaux of shape $\lambda$, then Chow, Eriksson and Fan observed that $\displaystyle\sum_{\lambda \vdash n} \text{Chess}(\lambda)^2$ is divisible by unusually large powers of $2$. In this paper, we give an explanation for this phenomenon, proving a lower bound of $n-O(\sqrt{n})$ for the $2$-adic valuation of this sum and a generalization of it. We do this by exploiting a connection with a certain representation of the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}$ on the vector space with basis indexed by partitions. Our result about chess tableaux then follows from a study of the basic representation of $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}$ with coefficients taken from the ring of rational numbers with odd denominators.			arxiv	['Stoyan Dimitrov']	83.0
333	Improving Chess Commentaries by Combining Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning Engines	Andrew Lee	2022-12-15 23:38:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08195v1	Despite many recent advancements in language modeling, state-of-the-art language models lack grounding in the real world and struggle with tasks involving complex reasoning. Meanwhile, advances in the symbolic reasoning capabilities of AI have led to systems that outperform humans in games like chess and Go (Silver et al., 2018). Chess commentary provides an interesting domain for bridging these two fields of research, as it requires reasoning over a complex board state and providing analyses in natural language. In this work we demonstrate how to combine symbolic reasoning engines with controllable language models to generate chess commentaries. We conduct experiments to demonstrate that our approach generates commentaries that are preferred by human judges over previous baselines.			arxiv	['David Wu', 'Emily Dinan', 'Mike Lewis']	84.0

However, there is a lack of systematic evaluation methods for self-adaptive and self-healing systems. We proposed CHESS, a novel approach to address this gap by evaluating self-adaptive and self-healing systems through fault injection based on chaos engineering (CE) [ arXiv:2208.13227 ]. The artifact presented in this paper provides an extensive overview of the use of CHESS through two microservice-based case studies: a smart office case study and an existing demo application called Yelb. It comes with a managing system service, a self-monitoring service, as well as five fault injection scenarios covering infrastructure faults and functional faults. Each of these components can be easily extended or replaced to adopt the CHESS approach to a new case study, help explore its promises and limitations, and identify directions for future research.

336	The Value of Chess Squares	Aditya Gupta	2023-07-08 20:17:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05330v2	We propose a neural network-based approach to calculate the value of a chess square-piece combination. Our model takes a triplet (Color, Piece, Square) as an input and calculates a value that measures the advantage/disadvantage of having this piece on this square. Our methods build on recent advances in chess AI, and can accurately assess the worth of positions in a game of chess. The conventional approach assigns fixed values to pieces $(\symking=\infty, \symqueen=9, \symrook=5, \symbishop=3, \symknight=3, \sympawn=1)$. We enhance this analysis by introducing marginal valuations. We use deep Q-learning to estimate the parameters of our model. We demonstrate our method by examining the positioning of Knights and Bishops, and also provide valuable insights into the valuation of pawns. Finally, we conclude by suggesting potential avenues for future research.			arxiv	['Shiva Maharaj', 'Nicholas Polson', 'Vadim Sokolov']	87.0

The study aims to predict the game outcome using machine learning techniques and develop an opening theme for each starting position. The first part of the analysis utilizes machine learning models to predict the game result based on certain moves in each position. The methodology involves segregating raw data from .pgn files into usable formats and creating datasets comprising approximately 500 games for each starting position. Three machine learning algorithms -- KNN Clustering, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Trees -- have been used to predict the game outcome. To establish an opening theme, the board is divided into five regions: center, white kingside, white queenside, black kingside, and black queenside. The data from games played by top engines in all 960 positions is used to track the movement of pieces in the opening. By analysing the change in the number of pieces in each region at specific moves, the report predicts the region towards which the game is developing. These models provide valuable insights into predicting game outcomes and understanding the opening theme in Chess 960.			arxiv	['Nishchal Dwivedi']	88.0

339	A study of memory effects in a chess database	Ana L. Schaigorodsky	2015-04-09 14:54:37	http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06611v2	A series of recent works studying a database of chronologically sorted chess games --containing 1.4 million games played by humans between 1998 and 2007-- have shown that the popularity distribution of chess game-lines follows a Zipf's law, and that time series inferred from the sequences of those game-lines exhibit long-range memory effects. The presence of Zipf's law together with long-range memory effects was observed in several systems, however, the simultaneous emergence of these two phenomena were always studied separately up to now. In this work, by making use of a variant of the Yule-Simon preferential growth model, introduced by Cattuto et al., we provide an explanation for the simultaneous emergence of Zipf's law and long-range correlations memory effects in a chess database. We find that Cattuto's Model (CM) is able to reproduce both, Zipf's law and the long-range correlations, including size-dependent scaling of the Hurst exponent for the corresponding time series. CM allows an explanation for the simultaneous emergence of these two phenomena via a preferential growth dynamics, including a memory kernel, in the popularity distribution of chess game-lines. This mechanism results in an aging process in the chess game-line choice as the database grows. Moreover, we find burstiness in the activity of subsets of the most active players, although the aggregated activity of the pool of players displays inter-event times without burstiness. We show that CM is not able to produce time series with bursty behavior providing evidence that burstiness is not required for the explanation of the long-range correlation effects in the chess database.			arxiv	['Juan I.

340	An Information Theoretic Analysis of Decision in Computer Chess	Alexandru Godescu	2011-12-09 16:50:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2144v1	The basis of the method proposed in this article is the idea that information is one of the most important factors in strategic decisions, including decisions in computer chess and other strategy games. The model proposed in this article and the algorithm described are based on the idea of a information theoretic basis of decision in strategy games . The model generalizes and provides a mathematical justification for one of the most popular search algorithms used in leading computer chess programs, the fractional ply scheme. However, despite its success in leading computer chess applications, until now few has been published about this method. The article creates a fundamental basis for this method in the axioms of information theory, then derives the principles used in programming the search and describes mathematically the form of the coefficients. One of the most important parameters of the fractional ply search is derived from fundamental principles. Until now this coefficient has been usually handcrafted or determined from intuitive elements or data mining. There is a deep, information theoretical justification for such a parameter. In one way the method proposed is a generalization of previous methods. More important, it shows why the fractional depth ply scheme is so powerful. It is because the algorithm navigates along the lines where the highest information gain is possible. A working and original implementation has been written and tested for this algorithm and is provided in the appendix. The article is essentially self-contained and gives proper background knowledge and references. The assumptions are intuitive and in the direction expected and described intuitively by great champions of chess.			arxiv	[]	91.0
341	Chessboard and chess piece recognition with the support of neural networks	Maciej A. Czyzewski	2017-08-13 12:34:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03898v3	Chessboard and chess piece recognition is a computer vision problem that has not yet been efficiently solved. However, its solution is crucial for many experienced players who wish to compete against AI bots, but also prefer to make decisions based on the analysis of a physical chessboard. It is also important for organizers of chess tournaments who wish to digitize play for online broadcasting or ordinary players who wish to share their gameplay with friends. Typically, such digitization tasks are performed by humans or with the aid of specialized chessboards and pieces. However, neither solution is easy or convenient. To solve this problem, we propose a novel algorithm for digitizing chessboard configurations. We designed a method that is resistant to lighting conditions and the angle at which images are captured, and works correctly with numerous chessboard styles. The proposed algorithm processes pictures iteratively. During each iteration, it executes three major sub-processes: detecting straight lines, finding lattice points, and positioning the chessboard. Finally, we identify all chess pieces and generate a description of the board utilizing standard notation. For each of these steps, we designed our own algorithm that surpasses existing solutions. We support our algorithms by utilizing machine learning techniques whenever possible. The described method performs extraordinarily well and achieves an accuracy over $99.5\%$ for detecting chessboard lattice points (compared to the $74\%$ for the best alternative), $95\%$ (compared to $60\%$ for the best alternative) for positioning the chessboard in an image, and almost $95\%$ for chess piece recognition.			arxiv	['Artur Laskowski', 'Szymon Wasik']	92.0

It has served to study human behavior from the perspective of a wide number of disciplines, from cognitive skills such as memory and learning, to aspects like innovation and decision making. Given that an extensive documentation of chess games played throughout history is available, it is possible to perform detailed and statistically significant studies about this sport. Here we use one of the most extensive chess databases in the world to construct two networks of chess players. One of the networks includes games that were played over-the-board and the other contains games played on the Internet. We study the main topological characteristics of the networks, such as degree distribution and correlations, transitivity and community structure. We complement the structural analysis by incorporating players' level of play as node metadata. Although both networks are topologically different, we show that in both cases players gather in communities according to their expertise and that an emergent rich-club structure, composed by the top-rated players, is also present.			arxiv	['Ana Laura Schaigorodsky', 'Juan Ignacio Perotti', 'Orlando Vito Billoni']	93.0
343	Exploring the Performance of Deep Residual Networks in Crazyhouse Chess	Sun-Yu Gordon Chi	2019-08-25 10:18:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09296v1	Crazyhouse is a chess variant that incorporates all of the classical chess rules, but allows users to drop pieces captured from the opponent as a normal move. Until 2018, all competitive computer engines for this board game made use of an alpha-beta pruning algorithm with a hand-crafted evaluation function for each position. Previous machine learning-based algorithms for just regular chess, such as NeuroChess and Giraffe, took hand-crafted evaluation features as input rather than a raw board representation. More recent projects, such as AlphaZero, reached massive success but required massive computational resources in order to reach its final strength. This paper describes the development of SixtyFour, an engine designed to compete in the chess variant of Crazyhouse with limited hardware. This specific variant poses a multitude of significant challenges due to its large branching factor, state-space complexity, and the multiple move types a player can make. We propose the novel creation of a neural network-based evaluation function for Crazyhouse.

Early versions of the network have attained a playing level comparable to a strong amateur on online servers.			arxiv	[]	94.0
344	CHESS: an Innovative Concept for High-Resolution, Far-UV Spectroscopy	Keri Hoadley	2020-08-14 21:19:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06575v1	The space ultraviolet (UV) is a critical astronomical observing window, where a multitude of atomic, ionic, and molecular signatures provide crucial insight into planetary, interstellar, stellar, intergalactic, and extragalactic objects. The next generation of large space telescopes require highly sensitive, moderate-to-high resolution UV spectrograph. However, sensitive observations in the UV are difficult, as UV optical performance and imaging efficiencies have lagged behind counterparts in the visible and infrared regimes. This has historically resulted in simple, low-bounce instruments to increase sensitivity. In this study, we present the design, fabrication, and calibration of a simple, high resolution, high throughput far-UV spectrograph - the Colorado High-resolution Echelle Stellar Spectrograph (CHESS). CHESS is a sounding rocket payload to demonstrate the instrument design for the next-generation UV space telescopes. We present tests and results on the performance of several state-of-the-art diffraction grating and detector technologies for far-UV astronomical applications that were flown aboard the first two iterations of CHESS. The CHESS spectrograph was used to study the atomic-to-molecular transitions within translucent cloud regions in the interstellar medium (ISM) through absorption spectroscopy. The first two flights looked at the sightlines towards alpha Virgo and epsilon Persei, and flight results are presented.			arxiv	['Kevin France', 'Nicholas Nell', 'Robert Kane', 'Brian Fleming', 'Allison Youngblood', 'Matthew Beasley']	95.0
345	Analysis of subsystems with rooks on a chess-board representing a partial Latin square (Part 2.)	Béla Jónás	2022-08-12 08:34:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06166v1	A partial Latin square of order $n$ can be represented by a $3$-dimensional chess-board of size $n\times n\times n$ with at most $n^2$ non-attacking rooks. In Latin squares, a subsystem and its most distant mate together have as many rooks as their capacity. That implies a simple capacity condition for the completion of partial Latin squares which is in fact the Cruse's necessary condition for characteristic matrices. Andersen-Hilton proved that, except for certain listed cases, a PLS of order $n$ can be completed if it contains only $n$ symbols. Andersen proved it for $n+1$ symbols, listing the cases to be excluded. Identifying the structures of the chess-board that can be overloaded with $n$ or $n+1$ rooks, it follows that a PLS derived from a chess-board with at most $n+1$ non-attacking rooks can be completed exactly if it satisfies the capacity condition. In a layer of a Latin square, two subsystems of a remote couple are in balance. Thus, a necessary condition for completion of a layer can be formulated, the balance condition. For an LSC, each 1-dimensional subspace of the chess-board contains exactly one rook. Consequently, for the PLSCs derived from partial Latin squares, we examine certain sets of 1-dimensional subspaces because they indicate the number of missing rooks.			arxiv	[]	96.0

From this description it can be shown that some of those problems exhibit chaotic behavior, an important fact in understanding the functioning of the related software. As a relatively simple example, it is shown that chess exhibits chaotic behavior in its configuration space. This implies that static evaluators in chess programs have intrinsic limitations.			arxiv	[]	98.0

Using the symbolic finite state method, developed by Thanatipanonda and Zeilberger, we prove that on a $3 \times n$ board, for almost all initial positions, White can checkmate Black in $\leq n+2$ moves, and that this upper bound is sharp. We also conjecture that for an arbitrary $m \times n$ board, with $m,n \geq 4$ (except for $(m,n)=(4,4)$ when it equals $7$), the number of needed moves is $\leq m+n$, and that this bound is also sharp.			arxiv	[]	102.0

In previous work we demonstrated how combining photographs of people and sequences taken from chess games between weak players can be used to generate chess problems or puzzles of higher aesthetic quality, on average, compared to alternative approaches. In this work we show experimentally that using larger images as opposed to smaller ones improves the output quality even further. The same is also true for using clearer or less corrupted images. The reasons why these things influence the DSNS process is presently not well-understood and debatable but the findings are nevertheless immediately applicable for obtaining better results.			arxiv	[]	105.0

We consider Gardner's minichess variant in which all pieces are set as in a standard chessboard (from Rook to King). This game has roughly 9x10^{18} legal positions and is comparable in this respect with checkers. We weakly solve this game, that is we prove its game-theoretic value and give a strategy to draw against best play for White and Black sides. Our approach requires surprisingly small computing power. We give a human readable proof. The way the result is obtained is generic and could be generalized to bigger chess settings or to other games.			arxiv	['Frederic Prost']	107.0

Upper bounds are obtained by solving entanglement problems, that is to find good Lovasz umbrellas, quantum state realizations of the graph. We observe that optimal states are always pure states. The rest is expository. One general interesting question is whether the Shannon capacity is always some n-th root of the independence number of the n'th power of the graph.			arxiv	[]	109.0
359	Modeling Precomputation In Games Played Under Computational Constraints	Thomas Orton	2021-05-19 14:06:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09145v1	Understanding the properties of games played under computational constraints remains challenging. For example, how do we expect rational (but computationally bounded) players to play games with a prohibitively large number of states, such as chess? This paper presents a novel model for the precomputation (preparing moves in advance) aspect of computationally constrained games. A fundamental trade-off is shown between randomness of play, and susceptibility to precomputation, suggesting that randomization is necessary in games with computational constraints. We present efficient algorithms for computing how susceptible a strategy is to precomputation, and computing an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium of our model. Numerical experiments measuring the trade-off between randomness and precomputation are provided for Stockfish (a well-known chess playing algorithm).			arxiv	[]	110.0

This number is obtained by restricting both bishops and pawns position and by a precise bound when no chessman has been captured. We improve this estimate and show that the number of diagrams is less than 4 x 10 37. To achieve this, we define a graph on the set of diagrams and a notion of class of pawn structure, leading to a method for bounding pawn positions with any number of men on the board.			arxiv	[]	112.0

The probabilistic properties of Elo's rating system have long been studied, and we provide an application of such methods. By applying a Brownian motion model of Stern as a simple tool we provide answers. Our research also has fundamental bearing on the choice of the $K$-factor used in Elo's system for GrandMaster (GM) chess play. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of policy issues involved with the choice of $K$-factor.			arxiv	['Shiva Maharaj', 'Nick Polson', 'Vadim Sokolov']	114.0

The competition provided a historical dataset of outcomes for chess games, and aimed to discover whether novel approaches can predict the outcomes of future games, more accurately than the well-known Elo rating system. The winning rating system, called Elo++ in the rest of the article, builds upon the Elo rating system. Like Elo, Elo++ uses a single rating per player and predicts the outcome of a game, by using a logistic curve over the difference in ratings of the players. The major component of Elo++ is a regularization technique that avoids overfitting these ratings. The dataset of chess games and outcomes is relatively small and one has to be careful not to draw ""too many conclusions"" out of the limited data. Many approaches tested in the competition showed signs of such an overfitting. The leader-board was dominated by attempts that did a very good job on a small test dataset, but couldn't generalize well on the private hold-out dataset. The Elo++ regularization takes into account the number of games per player, the recency of these games and the ratings of the opponents. Finally, Elo++ employs a stochastic gradient descent scheme for training the ratings, and uses only two global parameters (white's advantage and regularization constant) that are optimized using cross-validation."			arxiv	[]	116.0

In this paper, we describe three astronomy payloads developed (or in development) by the Ultraviolet Rocket Group at the University of Colorado. These far-ultraviolet (100 - 160 nm) spectrographic instruments are used to study a range of scientific topics, from gas in the interstellar medium (accessing diagnostics of material spanning five orders of magnitude in temperature in a single observation) to the energetic radiation environment of nearby exoplanetary systems. The three instruments, SLICE, CHESS, and SISTINE form a progression of instrument designs and component-level technology maturation. SLICE is a pathfinder instrument for the development of new data handling, storage, and telemetry techniques. CHESS and SISTINE are testbeds for technology and instrument design enabling high-resolution (R > 100,000) point source spectroscopy and high throughput imaging spectroscopy, respectively, in support of future Explorer, Probe, and Flagship-class missions. The CHESS and SISTINE payloads support the development and flight testing of large-format photon-counting detectors and advanced optical coatings: NASA's top two technology priorities for enabling a future flagship observatory (e.g., the LUVOIR Surveyor concept) that offers factors of roughly 50 - 100 gain in ultraviolet spectroscopy capability over the Hubble Space Telescope.

367	Explain Your Move: Understanding Agent Actions Using Specific and Relevant Feature Attribution	Nikaash Puri	2019-12-23 07:52:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12191v4	As deep reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to more tasks, there is a need to visualize and understand the behavior of learned agents. Saliency maps explain agent behavior by highlighting the features of the input state that are most relevant for the agent in taking an action. Existing perturbation-based approaches to compute saliency often highlight regions of the input that are not relevant to the action taken by the agent. Our proposed approach, SARFA (Specific and Relevant Feature Attribution), generates more focused saliency maps by balancing two aspects (specificity and relevance) that capture different desiderata of saliency. The first captures the impact of perturbation on the relative expected reward of the action to be explained. The second downweighs irrelevant features that alter the relative expected rewards of actions other than the action to be explained. We compare SARFA with existing approaches on agents trained to play board games (Chess and Go) and Atari games (Breakout, Pong and Space Invaders). We show through illustrative examples (Chess, Atari, Go), human studies (Chess), and automated evaluation methods (Chess) that SARFA generates saliency maps that are more interpretable for humans than existing approaches. For the code release and demo videos, see https://nikaashpuri.github.io/sarfa-saliency/.			arxiv	['Sukriti Verma', 'Piyush Gupta', 'Dhruv Kayastha', 'Shripad Deshmukh', 'Balaji Krishnamurthy', 'Sameer Singh']	118.0

One common question asked of such data is that of approximate search ($\rho-$nearest neighbors search). We present a hierarchical search algorithm for such data sets that takes advantage of particular geometric properties apparent in both astronomical and biological data sets, namely the metric entropy and fractal dimensionality of the data. We present CHESS (Clustered Hierarchical Entropy-Scaling Search), a search tool with virtually no loss in specificity or sensitivity, demonstrating a $13.6\times$ speedup over linear search on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's APOGEE data set and a $68\times$ speedup on the GreenGenes 16S metagenomic data set, as well as asymptotically fewer distance comparisons on APOGEE when compared to the FALCONN locality-sensitive hashing library. CHESS demonstrates an asymptotic complexity not directly dependent on data set size, and is in practice at least an order of magnitude faster than linear search by performing fewer distance comparisons. Unlike locality-sensitive hashing approaches, CHESS can work with any user-defined distance function. CHESS also allows for implicit data compression, which we demonstrate on the APOGEE data set.

369	A Novel Machine Learning Method for Preference Identification	Azlan Iqbal	2020-10-22 07:43:37	http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13517v2	Human preference or taste within any domain is usually a difficult thing to identify or predict with high probability. In the domain of chess problem composition, the same is true. Traditional machine learning approaches tend to focus on the ability of computers to process massive amounts of data and continuously adjust 'weights' within an artificial neural network to better distinguish between say, two groups of objects. Contrasted with chess compositions, there is no clear distinction between what constitutes one and what does not; even less so between a good one and a poor one. We propose a computational method that is able to learn from existing databases of 'liked' and 'disliked' compositions such that a new and unseen collection can be sorted with increased probability of matching a solver's preferences. The method uses a simple 'change factor' relating to the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) of each composition's starting position, coupled with repeated statistical analysis of sample pairs from both databases. Tested using the author's own collections of computer-generated chess problems, the experimental results showed that the method was able to sort a new and unseen collection of compositions such that, on average, over 70% of the preferred compositions were in the top half of the collection. This saves significant time and energy on the part of solvers as they are likely to find more of what they like sooner. The method may even be applicable to other domains such as image processing because it does not rely on any chess-specific rules but rather just a sufficient and quantifiable 'change' in representation from one object to the next.			arxiv	[]	120.0
370	Gambits: Theory and Evidence	Shiva Maharaj	2021-10-05 12:02:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02755v5	Gambits are central to human decision-making. Our goal is to provide a theory of Gambits. A Gambit is a combination of psychological and technical factors designed to disrupt predictable play. Chess provides an environment to study gambits and behavioral game theory. Our theory is based on the Bellman optimality path for sequential decision-making. This allows us to calculate the $Q$-values of a Gambit where material (usually a pawn) is sacrificed for dynamic play. On the empirical side, we study the effectiveness of a number of popular chess Gambits. This is a natural setting as chess Gambits require a sequential assessment of a set of moves (a.k.a. policy) after the Gambit has been accepted. Our analysis uses Stockfish 14.1 to calculate the optimal Bellman $Q$ values, which fundamentally measures if a position is winning or losing. To test whether Bellman's equation holds in play, we estimate the transition probabilities to the next board state via a database of expert human play. This then allows us to test whether the \emph{Gambiteer} is following the optimal path in his decision-making. Our methodology is applied to the popular Stafford and reverse Stafford (a.k.a. Boden-Kieretsky-Morphy) Gambit and other common ones including the Smith-Morra, Goring, Danish and Halloween Gambits. We build on research in human decision-making by proving an irrational skewness preference within agents in chess. We conclude with directions for future research.			arxiv	['Nicholas Polson', 'Christian Turk']	121.0
371	Distribution of rooks on a chess-board representing a Latin square partitioned by a subsystem	Béla Jónás	2022-08-08 13:18:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04113v1	A $d$-dimensional generalization of a Latin square of order $n$ can be considered as a chess-board of size $n\times n\times \ldots\times n$ ($d$ times), containing $n^d$ cells with $n^{d-1}$ non-attacking rooks. Each cell is identified by a $d$-tuple $(e_1,e_2,\ldots ,e_d)$ where $e_i \in \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}$. For $d = 3$ we prove that such a chess-board represents precisely one main class. A subsystem $T$ induced by a family of sets $<E_1,E_2,\ldots ,E_d>$ over $\{1,2,\ldots ,n\}$ is real if $E_i \subset \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}$ for each $i \in \{1,2,\ldots ,d\}$. The density of $T$ is the ratio of contained rooks to the number of cells in $T$. The distance between two subsystems is the minimum Hamming distance between cell pairs. Replacing $k$ sets of $<E_1,E_2,\ldots ,E_d>$ by their complements, a subsystem $U$ is obtained with distance $k$ between $T$ and $U$. All these subsystems, including $T$, form a partition of the chess-board. We prove that in such a partition, the number of rooks in a $U$ and the density of $U$ can be determined from the number of rooks in $T$ and the number of cells in $T$ and $U$ and the value of $(-1)^k$. We examine the subsystem couple $(T,U)$ in the $2$- and $3$-dimensional cases, where $U$ is the most distant unique subsystem from a real $T$. On the fly, a new identity of binomial coefficients is proved.			arxiv	[]	122.0

However, AI systems, like humans, make mistakes, have blind spots, hallucinate, and struggle to generalize to new situations. This work explores whether AI can benefit from creative decision-making mechanisms when pushed to the limits of its computational rationality. In particular, we investigate whether a team of diverse AI systems can outperform a single AI in challenging tasks by generating more ideas as a group and then selecting the best ones. We study this question in the game of chess, the so-called drosophila of AI. We build on AlphaZero (AZ) and extend it to represent a league of agents via a latent-conditioned architecture, which we call AZ_db. We train AZ_db to generate a wider range of ideas using behavioral diversity techniques and select the most promising ones with sub-additive planning. Our experiments suggest that AZ_db plays chess in diverse ways, solves more puzzles as a group and outperforms a more homogeneous team. Notably, AZ_db solves twice as many challenging puzzles as AZ, including the challenging Penrose positions. When playing chess from different openings, we notice that players in AZ_db specialize in different openings, and that selecting a player for each opening using sub-additive planning results in a 50 Elo improvement over AZ. Our findings suggest that diversity bonuses emerge in teams of AI agents, just as they do in teams of humans and that diversity is a valuable asset in solving computationally hard problems.			arxiv	['Vivek Veeriah', 'Shaobo Hou', 'Kevin Waugh', 'Matthew Lai', 'Edouard Leurent', 'Nenad Tomasev', 'Lisa Schut', 'Demis Hassabis', 'Satinder Singh']	124.0

We present some experiments in both chess and backgammon which demonstrate its utility and provide comparisons with TD(lambda) and another less radical variant, TD-directed(lambda). In particular, our chess program, ``KnightCap,'' used TDLeaf(lambda) to learn its evaluation function while playing on the Free Internet Chess Server (FICS, fics.onenet.net). It improved from a 1650 rating to a 2100 rating in just 308 games. We discuss some of the reasons for this success and the relationship between our results and Tesauro's results in backgammon.			arxiv	['Andrew Tridgell', 'Lex Weaver']	125.0
375	KnightCap: A chess program that learns by combining TD(lambda) with game-tree search	Jonathan Baxter	1999-01-10 03:21:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9901002v1	In this paper we present TDLeaf(lambda), a variation on the TD(lambda) algorithm that enables it to be used in conjunction with game-tree search. We present some experiments in which our chess program ``KnightCap'' used TDLeaf(lambda) to learn its evaluation function while playing on the Free Internet Chess Server (FICS, fics.onenet.net). The main success we report is that KnightCap improved from a 1650 rating to a 2150 rating in just 308 games and 3 days of play. As a reference, a rating of 1650 corresponds to about level B human play (on a scale from E (1000) to A (1800)), while 2150 is human master level. We discuss some of the reasons for this success, principle among them being the use of on-line, rather than self-play.			arxiv	['Andrew Tridgell', 'Lex Weaver']	126.0
376	The Chess conjecture	Rustam Sadykov	2003-01-31 15:30:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0301371v2	We prove that the homotopy class of a Morin mapping f: P^p --> Q^q with p-q odd contains a cusp mapping. This affirmatively solves a strengthened version of the Chess conjecture [DS Chess, A note on the classes [S_1^k(f)], Proc. Symp.

Soc. 124 (1998) 501-511] on the Hopf invariant one problem and Morin mappings, this implies that a manifold P^p with odd Euler characteristic does not admit Morin mappings into R^{2k+1} for p > 2k not equal to 1,3 or 7.			arxiv	[]	127.0
377	Zipf law in the popularity distribution of chess openings	B. Blasius	2007-04-20 13:38:20	http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2711v2	We perform a quantitative analysis of extensive chess databases and show that the frequencies of opening moves are distributed according to a power-law with an exponent that increases linearly with the game depth, whereas the pooled distribution of all opening weights follows Zipf's law with universal exponent. We propose a simple stochastic process that is able to capture the observed playing statistics and show that the Zipf law arises from the self-similar nature of the game tree of chess. Thus, in the case of hierarchical fragmentation the scaling is truly universal and independent of a particular generating mechanism. Our findings are of relevance in general processes with composite decisions.			arxiv	['R. Toenjes']	128.0
378	The $n$-Queens Problem in Higher Dimensions	Jeremiah Barr	2007-12-14 09:17:04	http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2309v1	A well-known chessboard problem is that of placing eight queens on the chessboard so that no two queens are able to attack each other. (Recall that a queen can attack anything on the same row, column, or diagonal as itself.) This problem is known to have been studied by Gauss, and can be generalized to an (n \times n) board, where (n \geq 4). We consider this problem in $d$-dimensional chess spaces, where (d \geq 3), and obtain the result that in higher dimensions, $n$ queens do not always suffice (in any arrangement) to attack all board positions. Our methods allow us to obtain the first lower bound on the number of queens that are necessary to attack all positions in a $d$-dimensional chess space of size $n$, and further to show that for any $k$, there are higher-dimensional chess spaces in which not all positions can be attacked by (n^k) queens.			arxiv	['Shrisha Rao']	129.0
379	A Methodology for Learning Players' Styles from Game Records	Mark Levene	2009-04-16 21:30:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2595v1	We describe a preliminary investigation into learning a Chess player's style from game records. The method is based on attempting to learn features of a player's individual evaluation function using the method of temporal differences, with the aid of a conventional Chess engine architecture. Some encouraging results were obtained in learning the styles of two recent Chess world champions, and we report on our attempt to use the learnt styles to discriminate between the players from game records by trying to detect who was playing white and who was playing black. We also discuss some limitations of our approach and propose possible directions for future research. The method we have presented may also be applicable to other strategic games, and may even be generalisable to other domains where sequences of agents' actions are recorded.			arxiv	['Trevor Fenner']	130.0
380	A streamlined approach to mapping the magnetic induction of skyrmionic materials	Jordan J. Chess	2016-08-21 21:11:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06000v2	Recently, Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) has helped researchers advance the emerging field of magnetic skyrmions. These magnetic quasi-particles, composed of topologically non-trivial magnetization textures, have a large potential for application as information carriers in low-power memory and logic devices. LTEM is one of a very few techniques for direct real space imaging of magnetic features at the nanoscale. For Fresnel-contrast LTEM, the transport of intensity equation (TIE) is the tool of choice for quantitative reconstruction of the local magnetic induction through the sample thickness. Typically this analysis requires collection of at least three images.Here we show that for uniform thin magnetic films which includes many skyrmionic samples, the magnetic induction can be quantitatively determined from a single defocused image using a simplified TIE approach.			arxiv	['Sergio A.

First, we propose an n-tuple network to extract features, since n-tuple networks require very little expert knowledge through its large numbers of features, while simulta-neously allowing easy access. Second, we propose a novel evalua-tion method that incorporates tapered eval into CT. Experiments show that with the same features and the same Chinese chess program, the automatically tuned comparison training feature weights achieved a win rate of 86.58% against the weights that were hand-tuned. The above trained version was then improved by adding additional features, most importantly n-tuple features. This improved version achieved a win rate of 81.65% against the trained version without additional features.			arxiv	['Jr-Chang Chen', 'I-Chen Wu', 'Tinghan Wei']	132.0

At special conditions, found in the present work, these patterns exhibit novel chess-board-like spatio-temporal structures which can be observed as the outcome of collision of two breathers. The infinitely extended chess-board-like patterns correspond to the continuous spectrum bands of the NLSE theory. More complicated patterns can be observed when the initial condition contains several localised periodic swells. These patterns can be observed in a variety of physical situations ranging from optics and hydrodynamics to Bose-Einstein condensates and plasma."			arxiv	['Zhan-Ying Yang', 'Wen-Li Yang', 'Nail Akhmediev']	133.0

Schaigorodsky	2013-07-02 15:30:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0729v3	In this paper we report the existence of long-range memory in the opening moves of a chronologically ordered set of chess games using an extensive chess database. We used two mapping rules to build discrete time series and analyzed them using two methods for detecting long-range correlations; rescaled range analysis and detrented fluctuation analysis. We found that long-range memory is related to the level of the players. When the database is filtered according to player levels we found differences in the persistence of the different subsets. For high level players, correlations are stronger at long time scales; whereas in intermediate and low level players they reach the maximum value at shorter time scales. This can be interpreted as a signature of the different strategies used by players with different levels of expertise. These results are robust against the assignation rules and the method employed in the analysis of the time series.			arxiv	['Juan I. Perotti', 'Orlando V. Billoni']	134.0

Our results show that using an appropriate mentor, we can evolve a program that is on par with top tournament-playing chess programs, outperforming a two-time World Computer Chess Champion. This performance gain is achieved by evolving a program with a smaller number of parameters in its evaluation function to mimic the behavior of a superior mentor which uses a more extensive evaluation function. In principle, our mentor-assisted approach could be used in a wide range of problems for which appropriate mentors are available.			arxiv	['Moshe Koppel', 'Nathan S. Netanyahu']	135.0
385	Simulating Human Grandmasters: Evolution and Coevolution of Evaluation Functions	Eli David	2017-11-18 10:16:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06840v1	This paper demonstrates the use of genetic algorithms for evolving a grandmaster-level evaluation function for a chess program. This is achieved by combining supervised and unsupervised learning. In the supervised learning phase the organisms are evolved to mimic the behavior of human grandmasters, and in the unsupervised learning phase these evolved organisms are further improved upon by means of coevolution. While past attempts succeeded in creating a grandmaster-level program by mimicking the behavior of existing computer chess programs, this paper presents the first successful attempt at evolving a state-of-the-art evaluation function by learning only from databases of games played by humans. Our results demonstrate that the evolved program outperforms a two-time World Computer Chess Champion.			arxiv	['H. Jaap van den Herik', 'Moshe Koppel', 'Nathan S. Netanyahu']	136.0
386	Nonattacking Queens in a Rectangular Strip	Seth Chaiken	2011-05-25 16:56:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5087v1	The function that counts the number of ways to place nonattacking identical chess or fairy chess pieces in a rectangular strip of fixed height and variable width, as a function of the width, is a piecewise polynomial which is eventually a polynomial and whose behavior can be described in some detail. We deduce this by converting the problem to one of counting lattice points outside an affinographic hyperplane arrangement, which Forge and Zaslavsky solved by means of weighted integral gain graphs. We extend their work by developing both generating functions and a detailed analysis of deletion and contraction for weighted integral gain graphs. For chess pieces we find the asymptotic probability that a random configuration is nonattacking, and we obtain exact counts of nonattacking configurations of small numbers of queens, bishops, knights, and nightriders.			arxiv	['Christopher R.

Hanusa	2019-01-07 16:56:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01917v2	We apply a one-dimensional discrete dynamical system originally considered by Arnol'd reminiscent of mathematical billiards to the study of two-move riders, a type of fairy chess piece. In this model, particles travel through a bounded convex region along line segments of one of two fixed slopes. We apply this dynamical system to characterize the vertices of the inside-out polytope arising from counting placements of nonattacking chess pieces and also to give a bound for the period of the counting quasipolynomial. The analysis focuses on points of the region that are on trajectories that contain a corner or on cycles of full rank, or are crossing points thereof. As a consequence, we give a simple proof that the period of the bishops' counting quasipolynomial is 2, and provide formulas bounding periods of counting quasipolynomials for many two-move riders including all partial nightriders. We draw parallels to the theory of mathematical billiards and pose many new open questions.			arxiv	['Arvind V. Mahankali']	138.0
388	Search in Imperfect Information Games	Martin Schmid	2021-11-10 19:06:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05884v1	From the very dawn of the field, search with value functions was a fundamental concept of computer games research. Turing's chess algorithm from 1950 was able to think two moves ahead, and Shannon's work on chess from $1950$ includes an extensive section on evaluation functions to be used within a search. Samuel's checkers program from 1959 already combines search and value functions that are learned through self-play and bootstrapping. TD-Gammon improves upon those ideas and uses neural networks to learn those complex value functions -- only to be again used within search. The combination of decision-time search and value functions has been present in the remarkable milestones where computers bested their human counterparts in long standing challenging games -- DeepBlue for Chess and AlphaGo for Go. Until recently, this powerful framework of search aided with (learned) value functions has been limited to perfect information games. As many interesting problems do not provide the agent perfect information of the environment, this was an unfortunate limitation. This thesis introduces the reader to sound search for imperfect information games.			arxiv	[]	139.0
389	Improving Ranking Quality and Fairness in Swiss-System Chess Tournaments	Pascal Sauer	2021-12-20 13:31:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10522v2	The International Chess Federation (FIDE) imposes a voluminous and complex set of player pairing criteria in Swiss-system chess tournaments and endorses computer programs that are able to calculate the prescribed pairings. The purpose of these formalities is to ensure that players are paired fairly during the tournament and that the final ranking corresponds to the players' true strength order. We contest the official FIDE player pairing routine by presenting alternative pairing rules. These can be enforced by computing maximum weight matchings in a carefully designed graph. We demonstrate by extensive experiments that a tournament format using our mechanism 1) yields fairer pairings in the rounds of the tournament and 2) produces a final ranking that reflects the players' true strengths better than the state-of-the-art FIDE pairing system.			arxiv	['Ágnes Cseh', 'Pascal Lenzner']	140.0
390	Quantifying human performance in chess	Sandeep Chowdhary	2022-07-15 23:13:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07780v1	From sports to science, the recent availability of large-scale data has allowed to gain insights on the drivers of human innovation and success in a variety of domains. Here we quantify human performance in the popular game of chess by leveraging a very large dataset comprising of over 120 million games between almost 1 million players. We find that individuals encounter hot streaks of repeated success, longer for beginners than for expert players, and even longer cold streaks of unsatisfying performance. Skilled players can be distinguished from the others based on their gaming behaviour. Differences appear from the very first moves of the game, with experts tending to specialize and repeat the same openings while beginners explore and diversify more. However, experts experience a broader response repertoire, and display a deeper understanding of different variations within the same line. Over time, the opening diversity of a player tends to decrease, hinting at the development of individual playing styles. Nevertheless, we find that players are often not able to recognize their most successful openings. Overall, our work contributes to quantifying human performance in competitive settings, providing a first large-scale quantitative analysis of individual careers in chess, helping unveil the determinants separating elite from beginner performance.			arxiv	['Iacopo Iacopini', 'Federico Battiston']	141.0

Language models, can help gain insight into a variety of interesting problems such as unsupervised learning rules of a game, detecting player behavior patterns, player attribution, and ultimately learning the game to beat state of the art. In this study, we applied BERT models, first to the simple Nim game to analyze its performance in the presence of noise in a setup of a few-shot learning architecture. We analyzed the model performance via three virtual players, namely Nim Guru, Random player, and Q-learner. In the second part, we applied the game learning language model to the chess game, and a large set of grandmaster games with exhaustive encyclopedia openings. Finally, we have shown that model practically learns the rules of the chess game and can survive games against Stockfish at a category-A rating level.			arxiv	['Erhan Guven']	142.0
392	On the Smoothness and Regularity of the Chess Billiard Flow and the Poincaré Problem	Sally Zhu	2022-10-12 23:18:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13384v1	The Poincar\'e problem is a model of two-dimensional internal waves in stable-stratified fluid. The chess billiard flow, a variation of a typical billiard flow, drives the formation behind and describes the evolution of these internal waves, and its trajectories can be represented as rotations around the boundary of a given domain. We find that for sufficiently irrational rotation in the square, or when the rotation number $r(\lambda)$ is Diophantine, the regularity of the solution $u(t)$ of the evolution problem correlates directly to the regularity of the forcing function $f(x)$. Additionally, we show that when $f$ is smooth, then $u$ is also smooth. These results extend studies that have examined singularity points, or the lack of regularity, in rational rotations of the chess billiard flow. We also present numerical simulations in various geometries that analyze plateau formation and fractal dimension in $r(\lambda)$ and conjecture an extension of our results. Our results can be applied in modeling two dimensional oceanic waves, and they also relate the classical quantum correspondence to fluid study.			arxiv	['Zhenhao Li']	143.0

Ismail	2023-02-27 16:40:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13937v3	"In this note, I introduce a new framework called n-person games with partial knowledge, in which players have only limited knowledge about the aspects of the game -- including actions, outcomes, and other players. For example, playing an actual game of chess is a game of partial knowledge. To analyze these games, I introduce a set of new concepts and mechanisms for measuring the intelligence of players, with a focus on the interplay between human- and machine-based decision-making. Specifically, I introduce two main concepts: firstly, the Game Intelligence (GI) mechanism, which quantifies a player's demonstrated intelligence in a game by considering not only the game's outcome but also the ""mistakes"" made during the game according to the reference machine's intelligence. Secondly, I define gaming-proofness, a practical and computational concept of strategy-proofness. The GI mechanism provides a practicable way to assess players and can potentially be applied to a wide range of games, from chess and backgammon to AI systems. To illustrate the GI mechanism, I apply it to an extensive dataset comprising over a million moves made by top chess Grandmasters."			arxiv	[]	144.0

This paper probes the performance of ChatGPT, a sophisticated language model by OpenAI in tackling such complex reasoning tasks, using chess as a case study. Through robust metrics examining both the legality and quality of moves, we assess ChatGPT's understanding of the chessboard, adherence to chess rules, and strategic decision-making abilities. Our evaluation identifies limitations within ChatGPT's attention mechanism that affect its formal language comprehension and uncovers the model's underdeveloped self-regulation abilities. Our study also reveals ChatGPT's propensity for a coherent strategy in its gameplay and a noticeable uptick in decision-making assertiveness when the model is presented with a greater volume of natural language or possesses a more lucid understanding of the state of the chessboard. These findings contribute to the growing exploration of language models' abilities beyond natural language processing, providing valuable information for future research towards models demonstrating human-like cognitive abilities.			arxiv	['Chih-Chung Hsueh', 'Richard Tzong-Han Tsai']	145.0

Ribeiro	2012-12-12 12:02:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2787v1	The complexity of chess matches has attracted broad interest since its invention. This complexity and the availability of large number of recorded matches make chess an ideal model systems for the study of population-level learning of a complex system. We systematically investigate the move-by-move dynamics of the white player's advantage from over seventy thousand high level chess matches spanning over 150 years. We find that the average advantage of the white player is positive and that it has been increasing over time. Currently, the average advantage of the white player is ~0.17 pawns but it is exponentially approaching a value of 0.23 pawns with a characteristic time scale of 67 years. We also study the diffusion of the move dependence of the white player's advantage and find that it is non-Gaussian, has long-ranged anti-correlations and that after an initial period with no diffusion it becomes super-diffusive. We find that the duration of the non-diffusive period, corresponding to the opening stage of a match, is increasing in length and exponentially approaching a value of 15.6 moves with a characteristic time scale of 130 years. We interpret these two trends as a resulting from learning of the features of the game. Additionally, we find that the exponent {\alpha} characterizing the super-diffusive regime is increasing toward a value of 1.9, close to the ballistic regime. We suggest that this trend is due to the increased broadening of the range of abilities of chess players participating in major tournaments.			arxiv	['R. S. Mendes', 'E. K.

396	Aligning Superhuman AI with Human Behavior: Chess as a Model System	Reid McIlroy-Young	2020-06-02 18:12:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01855v3	As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly intelligent---in some cases, achieving superhuman performance---there is growing potential for humans to learn from and collaborate with algorithms. However, the ways in which AI systems approach problems are often different from the ways people do, and thus may be uninterpretable and hard to learn from. A crucial step in bridging this gap between human and artificial intelligence is modeling the granular actions that constitute human behavior, rather than simply matching aggregate human performance. We pursue this goal in a model system with a long history in artificial intelligence: chess. The aggregate performance of a chess player unfolds as they make decisions over the course of a game. The hundreds of millions of games played online by players at every skill level form a rich source of data in which these decisions, and their exact context, are recorded in minute detail. Applying existing chess engines to this data, including an open-source implementation of AlphaZero, we find that they do not predict human moves well. We develop and introduce Maia, a customized version of Alpha-Zero trained on human chess games, that predicts human moves at a much higher accuracy than existing engines, and can achieve maximum accuracy when predicting decisions made by players at a specific skill level in a tuneable way. For a dual task of predicting whether a human will make a large mistake on the next move, we develop a deep neural network that significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Taken together, our results suggest that there is substantial promise in designing artificial intelligence systems with human collaboration in mind by first accurately modeling granular human decision-making.			arxiv	['Siddhartha Sen', 'Jon Kleinberg', 'Ashton Anderson']	147.0
397	Statistical analysis of chess games: space control and tipping points	Marc Barthelemy	2023-04-22 14:54:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11425v2	Moves in chess games are usually analyzed on a case-by-case basis by professional players, but thanks to the availability of large game databases, we can envision another approach of the game. Here, we indeed adopt a very different point of view, and analyze moves in chess games from a statistical point of view. We first focus on spatial properties and the location of pieces and show that the number of possible moves during a game is positively correlated with its outcome. We then study heatmaps of pieces and show that the spatial distribution of pieces varies less between human players than with engines (such as Stockfish): engines seem to use pieces in a very different way as human did for centuries. These heatmaps also allow us to construct a distance between players that characterizes how they use their pieces. In a second part, we focus on the best move and the second best move found by Stockfish and study the difference $\Delta$ of their evaluation. We found different regimes during a chess game. In a `quiet' regime, $\Delta$ is small, indicating that many paths are possible for both players. In contrast, there are also `volatile' regimes characterized by a `tipping point', for which $\Delta$ becomes large. At these tipping points, the outcome could then switch completely depending on the move chosen. We also found that for a large number of games, the distribution of $\Delta$ can be fitted by a power law $P(\Delta)\sim \Delta^{-\beta}$ with an exponent that seems to be universal (for human players and engines) and around $\beta\approx 1.8$. The probability to encounter a tipping point in a game is therefore far from being negligible. Finally, we conclude by mentioning possible directions of research for a quantitative understanding of chess games such as the structure of the pawn chain, the interaction graph between pieces, or a quantitative definition of critical points.			arxiv	[]	148.0
398	The CHESS chemical Herschel surveys of star forming regions: Peering into the protostellar shock L1157-B1. I. Shock chemical complexity	C. Codella	2010-06-09 17:42:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1864v1	We present the first results of the unbiased survey of the L1157-B1 bow shock, obtained with HIFI in the framework of the key program Chemical Herschel surveys of star forming regions (CHESS). The L1157 outflow is driven by a low-mass Class 0 protostar and is considered the prototype of the so-called chemically active outflows. The bright blue-shifted bow shock B1 is the ideal laboratory for studying the link between the hot (around 1000-2000 K) component traced by H2 IR-emission and the cold (around 10-20 K) swept-up material. The main aim is to trace the warm gas chemically enriched by the passage of a shock and to infer the excitation conditions in L1157-B1. A total of 27 lines are identified in the 555-636 GHz region, down to an average 3 sigma level of 30 mK. The emission is dominated by CO(5-4) and H2O(110-101) transitions, as discussed by Lefloch et al. (2010). Here we report on the identification of lines from NH3, H2CO, CH3OH, CS, HCN, and HCO+. The comparison between the profiles produced by molecules released from dust mantles (NH3, H2CO, CH3OH) and that of H2O is consistent with a scenario in which water is also formed in the gas-phase in high-temperature regions where sputtering or grain-grain collisions are not efficient. The high excitation range of the observed tracers allows us to infer, for the first time for these species, the existence of a warm (> 200 K) gas component coexisting in the B1 bow structure with the cold and hot gas detected from ground.			arxiv	['B.

399	A Discrete Evolutionary Model for Chess Players' Ratings	Trevor Fenner	2011-03-08 13:51:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1530v2	The Elo system for rating chess players, also used in other games and sports, was adopted by the World Chess Federation over four decades ago. Although not without controversy, it is accepted as generally reliable and provides a method for assessing players' strengths and ranking them in official tournaments. It is generally accepted that the distribution of players' rating data is approximately normal but, to date, no stochastic model of how the distribution might have arisen has been proposed. We propose such an evolutionary stochastic model, which models the arrival of players into the rating pool, the games they play against each other, and how the results of these games affect their ratings. Using a continuous approximation to the discrete model, we derive the distribution for players' ratings at time $t$ as a normal distribution, where the variance increases in time as a logarithmic function of $t$. We validate the model using published rating data from 2007 to 2010, showing that the parameters obtained from the data can be recovered through simulations of the stochastic model. The distribution of players' ratings is only approximately normal and has been shown to have a small negative skew. We show how to modify our evolutionary stochastic model to take this skewness into account, and we validate the modified model using the published official rating data.			arxiv	['Mark Levene', 'George Loizou']	150.0

In fact, religiosity is one of the most important sociological aspects of populations. Languages are also a characteristics of the human kind. New religions, new languages appear though others disappear. All religions and languages evolve when they adapt to the society developments. On the other hand, the number of adherents of a given religion, the number of persons speaking a language is not fixed. Several questions can be raised. E.g. from a macroscopic point of view : How many religions/languages exist at a given time? What is their distribution? What is their life time? How do they evolve?. From a microscopic view point: can one invent agent based models to describe macroscopic aspects? Does it exist simple evolution equations? It is intuitively accepted, but also found through from statistical analysis of the frequency distribution that an attachment process is the primary cause of the distribution evolution : usually the initial religion/language is that of the mother. Later on, changes can occur either due to heterogeneous agent interaction processes or due to external field constraints, - or both. Such cases can be illustrated with historical facts and data. It is stressed that characteristic time scales are different, and recalled that external fields are very relevant in the case of religions, rending the study more interesting within a mechanistic approach			arxiv	[]	151.0
401	A More Human Way to Play Computer Chess	Kieran Greer	2015-03-14 18:47:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04333v5	This paper suggests a forward-pruning technique for computer chess that uses 'Move Tables', which are like Transposition Tables, but for moves not positions. They use an efficient memory structure and has put the design into the context of long and short-term memories. The long-term memory updates a play path with weight reinforcement, while the short-term memory can be immediately added or removed. With this, 'long branches' can play a short path, before returning to a full search at the resulting leaf nodes. Re-using an earlier search path allows the tree to be forward-pruned, which is known to be dangerous, because it removes part of the search process. Additional checks are therefore made and moves can even be re-added when the search result is unsatisfactory. Automatic feature analysis is now central to the algorithm, where key squares and related squares can be generated automatically and used to guide the search process. Using this analysis, if a search result is inferior, it can re-insert un-played moves that cover these key squares only. On the tactical side, a type of move that the forward-pruning will fail on is recognised and a pattern-based solution to that problem is suggested. This has completed the theory of an earlier paper and resulted in a more human-like approach to searching for a chess move. Tests demonstrate that the obvious blunders associated with forward pruning are no longer present and that it can compete at the top level with regard to playing strength.			arxiv	[]	152.0
402	On the ranking of a Swiss system chess team tournament	László Csató	2015-07-08 11:44:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05045v5	The paper suggests a family of paired comparison-based scoring procedures for ranking the participants of a Swiss system chess team tournament. We present the challenges of ranking in Swiss system, the features of individual and team competitions as well as the failures of the official rankings based on lexicographical order. The tournament is represented as a ranking problem such that the linearly-solvable row sum (score), generalized row sum, and least squares methods have favourable axiomatic properties. Two chess team European championships are analysed as case studies. Final rankings are compared by their distances and visualized with multidimensional scaling (MDS). Differences to the official ranking are revealed by the decomposition of the least squares method. Rankings are evaluated by prediction power, retrodictive performance, and stability. The paper argues for the use of least squares method with a results matrix favouring match points on the basis of its relative insensitivity to the choice between match and board points, retrodictive accuracy, and robustness.			arxiv	[]	153.0
403	Assessing Human Error Against a Benchmark of Perfection	Ashton Anderson	2016-06-15 20:00:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04956v1	An increasing number of domains are providing us with detailed trace data on human decisions in settings where we can evaluate the quality of these decisions via an algorithm. Motivated by this development, an emerging line of work has begun to consider whether we can characterize and predict the kinds of decisions where people are likely to make errors. To investigate what a general framework for human error prediction might look like, we focus on a model system with a rich history in the behavioral sciences: the decisions made by chess players as they select moves in a game. We carry out our analysis at a large scale, employing datasets with several million recorded games, and using chess tablebases to acquire a form of ground truth for a subset of chess positions that have been completely solved by computers but remain challenging even for the best players in the world. We organize our analysis around three categories of features that we argue are present in most settings where the analysis of human error is applicable: the skill of the decision-maker, the time available to make the decision, and the inherent difficulty of the decision. We identify rich structure in all three of these categories of features, and find strong evidence that in our domain, features describing the inherent difficulty of an instance are significantly more powerful than features based on skill or time.			arxiv	['Jon Kleinberg', 'Sendhil Mullainathan']	154.0
404	On the Complexity of Reconnaissance Blind Chess	Jared Markowitz	2018-11-07 19:20:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03119v2	This paper provides a complexity analysis for the game of reconnaissance blind chess (RBC), a recently-introduced variant of chess where each player does not know the positions of the opponent's pieces a priori but may reveal a subset of them through chosen, private sensing actions. In contrast to many commonly studied imperfect information games like poker, an RBC player does not know what the opponent knows or has chosen to learn, exponentially expanding the size of the game's information sets (i.e., the number of possible game states that are consistent with what a player has observed). Effective RBC sensing and moving strategies must account for the uncertainty of both players, an essential element of many real-world decision-making problems. Here we evaluate RBC from a game theoretic perspective, tracking the proliferation of information sets from the perspective of selected canonical bot players in tournament play. We show that, even for effective sensing strategies, the game sizes of RBC compare to those of Go while the average size of a player's information set throughout an RBC game is much greater than that of a player in Heads-up Limit Hold 'Em. We compare these measures of complexity among different playing algorithms and provide cursory assessments of the various sensing and moving strategies.			arxiv	['Ryan W. Gardner', 'Ashley J.

405	Multimodal Observation and Interpretation of Subjects Engaged in Problem Solving	Thomas Guntz	2017-10-12 12:59:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04486v1	In this paper we present the first results of a pilot experiment in the capture and interpretation of multimodal signals of human experts engaged in solving challenging chess problems. Our goal is to investigate the extent to which observations of eye-gaze, posture, emotion and other physiological signals can be used to model the cognitive state of subjects, and to explore the integration of multiple sensor modalities to improve the reliability of detection of human displays of awareness and emotion. We observed chess players engaged in problems of increasing difficulty while recording their behavior. Such recordings can be used to estimate a participant's awareness of the current situation and to predict ability to respond effectively to challenging situations. Results show that a multimodal approach is more accurate than a unimodal one. By combining body posture, visual attention and emotion, the multimodal approach can reach up to 93% of accuracy when determining player's chess expertise while unimodal approach reaches 86%. Finally this experiment validates the use of our equipment as a general and reproducible tool for the study of participants engaged in screen-based interaction and/or problem solving.			arxiv	['Raffaella Balzarini', 'Dominique Vaufreydaz', 'James L.

406	Mastering Atari, Go, Chess and Shogi by Planning with a Learned Model	Julian Schrittwieser	2019-11-19 13:58:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265v2	Constructing agents with planning capabilities has long been one of the main challenges in the pursuit of artificial intelligence. Tree-based planning methods have enjoyed huge success in challenging domains, such as chess and Go, where a perfect simulator is available. However, in real-world problems the dynamics governing the environment are often complex and unknown. In this work we present the MuZero algorithm which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics. MuZero learns a model that, when applied iteratively, predicts the quantities most directly relevant to planning: the reward, the action-selection policy, and the value function. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games - the canonical video game environment for testing AI techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled - our new algorithm achieved a new state of the art. When evaluated on Go, chess and shogi, without any knowledge of the game rules, MuZero matched the superhuman performance of the AlphaZero algorithm that was supplied with the game rules.			arxiv	['Ioannis Antonoglou', 'Thomas Hubert', 'Karen Simonyan', 'Laurent Sifre', 'Simon Schmitt', 'Arthur Guez', 'Edward Lockhart', 'Demis Hassabis', 'Thore Graepel', 'Timothy Lillicrap', 'David Silver']	157.0
407	Detecting Individual Decision-Making Style: Exploring Behavioral Stylometry in Chess	Reid McIlroy-Young	2022-08-02 11:18:16	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01366v1	The advent of machine learning models that surpass human decision-making ability in complex domains has initiated a movement towards building AI systems that interact with humans. Many building blocks are essential for this activity, with a central one being the algorithmic characterization of human behavior. While much of the existing work focuses on aggregate human behavior, an important long-range goal is to develop behavioral models that specialize to individual people and can differentiate among them. To formalize this process, we study the problem of behavioral stylometry, in which the task is to identify a decision-maker from their decisions alone. We present a transformer-based approach to behavioral stylometry in the context of chess, where one attempts to identify the player who played a set of games. Our method operates in a few-shot classification framework, and can correctly identify a player from among thousands of candidate players with 98% accuracy given only 100 labeled games. Even when trained on amateur play, our method generalises to out-of-distribution samples of Grandmaster players, despite the dramatic differences between amateur and world-class players. Finally, we consider more broadly what our resulting embeddings reveal about human style in chess, as well as the potential ethical implications of powerful methods for identifying individuals from behavioral data.			arxiv	['Russell Wang', 'Siddhartha Sen', 'Jon Kleinberg', 'Ashton Anderson']	158.0
408	ChessGPT: Bridging Policy Learning and Language Modeling	Xidong Feng	2023-06-15 15:35:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09200v2	When solving decision-making tasks, humans typically depend on information from two key sources: (1) Historical policy data, which provides interaction replay from the environment, and (2) Analytical insights in natural language form, exposing the invaluable thought process or strategic considerations. Despite this, the majority of preceding research focuses on only one source: they either use historical replay exclusively to directly learn policy or value functions, or engaged in language model training utilizing mere language corpus. In this paper, we argue that a powerful autonomous agent should cover both sources. Thus, we propose ChessGPT, a GPT model bridging policy learning and language modeling by integrating data from these two sources in Chess games. Specifically, we build a large-scale game and language dataset related to chess. Leveraging the dataset, we showcase two model examples ChessCLIP and ChessGPT, integrating policy learning and language modeling. Finally, we propose a full evaluation framework for evaluating language model's chess ability. Experimental results validate our model and dataset's effectiveness. We open source our code, model, and dataset at https://github.com/waterhorse1/ChessGPT.			arxiv	['Yicheng Luo', 'Ziyan Wang', 'Hongrui Tang', 'Mengyue Yang', 'Kun Shao', 'David Mguni', 'Yali Du', 'Jun Wang']	159.0
409	Bridging the Human-AI Knowledge Gap: Concept Discovery and Transfer in AlphaZero	Lisa Schut	2023-10-25 06:49:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16410v1	Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have made remarkable progress, attaining super-human performance across various domains. This presents us with an opportunity to further human knowledge and improve human expert performance by leveraging the hidden knowledge encoded within these highly performant AI systems. Yet, this knowledge is often hard to extract, and may be hard to understand or learn from. Here, we show that this is possible by proposing a new method that allows us to extract new chess concepts in AlphaZero, an AI system that mastered the game of chess via self-play without human supervision. Our analysis indicates that AlphaZero may encode knowledge that extends beyond the existing human knowledge, but knowledge that is ultimately not beyond human grasp, and can be successfully learned from. In a human study, we show that these concepts are learnable by top human experts, as four top chess grandmasters show improvements in solving the presented concept prototype positions. This marks an important first milestone in advancing the frontier of human knowledge by leveraging AI; a development that could bear profound implications and help us shape how we interact with AI systems across many AI applications.			arxiv	['Nenad Tomasev', 'Tom McGrath', 'Demis Hassabis', 'Ulrich Paquet', 'Been Kim']	160.0

CHESS is a far ultraviolet (FUV) rocket-borne instrument designed to study the atomic-to-molecular transitions within translucent cloud regions in the interstellar medium (ISM). CHESS is an objective f/12.4 echelle spectrograph with resolving power $>$ 100,000 over the band pass 1000 $-$ 1600 {\AA}. The spectrograph was designed to employ an R2 echelle grating with ""low"" line density. We compare the FUV performance of experimental echelle etching processes (lithographically by LightSmyth, Inc. and etching via electron-beam technology by JPL Microdevices Laboratory) with traditional, mechanically-ruled gratings (Bach Research, Inc. and Richardson Gratings). The cross-dispersing grating, developed and ruled by Horiba Jobin-Yvon, is a holographically-ruled, ""low"" line density, powered optic with a toroidal surface curvature. Both gratings were coated with aluminum and lithium fluoride (Al+LiF) at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Results from final efficiency and reflectivity measurements for the optical components of CHESS-2 are presented. CHESS-2 utilizes a 40mm-diameter cross-strip anode readout microchannel plate (MCP) detector fabricated by Sensor Sciences, Inc., to achieve high spatial resolution with high count rate capabilities (global rates $>$ 1 MHz). We present pre-flight laboratory spectra and calibration results. CHESS-2 launched on 21 February 2016 aboard NASA/CU sounding rocket mission 36.297 UG. We observed the intervening ISM material along the sightline to $\epsilon$ Per and present initial characterization of the column densities, temperature, and kinematics of atomic and molecular species in the observation."			arxiv	['Kevin France', 'Nicholas Kruczek', 'Brian Fleming', 'Nicholas Nell', 'Robert Kane', 'Jack Swanson', 'James Green', 'Nicholas Erickson', 'Jacob Wilson']	163.0

414	Learning to play the Chess Variant Crazyhouse above World Champion Level with Deep Neural Networks and Human Data	Johannes Czech	2019-08-19 09:31:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06660v2	Deep neural networks have been successfully applied in learning the board games Go, chess and shogi without prior knowledge by making use of reinforcement learning. Although starting from zero knowledge has been shown to yield impressive results, it is associated with high computationally costs especially for complex games. With this paper, we present CrazyAra which is a neural network based engine solely trained in supervised manner for the chess variant crazyhouse. Crazyhouse is a game with a higher branching factor than chess and there is only limited data of lower quality available compared to AlphaGo. Therefore, we focus on improving efficiency in multiple aspects while relying on low computational resources. These improvements include modifications in the neural network design and training configuration, the introduction of a data normalization step and a more sample efficient Monte-Carlo tree search which has a lower chance to blunder. After training on 569,537 human games for 1.5 days we achieve a move prediction accuracy of 60.4%. During development, versions of CrazyAra played professional human players. Most notably, CrazyAra achieved a four to one win over 2017 crazyhouse world champion Justin Tan (aka LM Jann Lee) who is more than 400 Elo higher rated compared to the average player in our training set. Furthermore, we test the playing strength of CrazyAra on CPU against all participants of the second Crazyhouse Computer Championships 2017, winning against twelve of the thirteen participants. Finally, for CrazyAraFish we continue training our model on generated engine games. In ten long-time control matches playing Stockfish 10, CrazyAraFish wins three games and draws one out of ten matches.			arxiv	['Moritz Willig', 'Alena Beyer', 'Kristian Kersting', 'Johannes Fürnkranz']	165.0

419	Amazons is PSPACE-complete	Robert A. Hearn	2005-02-02 18:55:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0502013v1	Amazons is a board game which combines elements of Chess and Go. It has become popular in recent years, and has served as a useful platform for both game-theoretic study and AI games research. Buro showed that simple Amazons endgames are NP-equivalent, leaving the complexity of the general case as an open problem. We settle this problem, by showing that deciding the outcome of an n x n Amazons position is PSPACE-hard. We give a reduction from one of the PSPACE-complete two-player formula games described by Schaefer. Since the number of moves in an Amazons game is polynomially bounded (unlike Chess and Go), Amazons is in PSPACE. It is thus on a par with other two-player, bounded-move, perfect-information games such as Hex, Othello, and Kayles. Our construction also provides an alternate proof that simple Amazons endgames are NP-equivalent. Our reduction uses a number of amazons polynomial in the input formula length; a remaining open problem is the complexity of Amazons when only a constant number of amazons is used.			arxiv	[]	170.0

Gaifullin	2009-04-27 17:42:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.4222v1	In this paper we construct and study a new 15-vertex triangulation $X$ of the complex projective plane $\CP^2$. The automorphism group of $X$ is isomorphic to $S_4\times S_3$. We prove that the triangulation $X$ is the minimal by the number of vertices triangulation of $\CP^2$ admitting a chess colouring of four-dimensional simplices. We provide explicit parametrizations for simplices of $X$ and show that the automorphism group of $X$ can be realized as a group of isometries of the Fubini--Study metric. We provide a 33-vertex subdivision $\bX$ of the triangulation $X$ such that the classical moment mapping $\mu:\CP^2\to\Delta^2$ is a simplicial mapping of the triangulation $\bX$ onto the barycentric subdivision of the triangle $\Delta^2$. We study the relationship of the triangulation $X$ with complex crystallographic groups.			arxiv	[]	171.0

A mathematical model of the partial depth scheme is outlined and a formula for the partial depth added for each ply is calculated from the principles of the model. An implementation of alpha-beta with partial depth is given. The method is tested using an experimental strategy having as objective to show the effect of allocation of a higher amount of search resources on areas of the search tree with higher information. The search proceeds in the direction of lines with higher information gain. The effects on search performance of allocating higher search resources on lines with higher information gain are tested experimentaly and conclusive results are obtained. In order to isolate the effects of the partial depth scheme no other heuristic is used.			arxiv	[]	172.0
422	Dynamic Move Chains -- a Forward Pruning Approach to Tree Search in Computer Chess	Kieran Greer	2014-03-04 13:07:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0778v1	This paper proposes a new mechanism for pruning a search game-tree in computer chess. The algorithm stores and then reuses chains or sequences of moves, built up from previous searches. These move sequences have a built-in forward-pruning mechanism that can radically reduce the search space. A typical search process might retrieve a move from a Transposition Table, where the decision of what move to retrieve would be based on the position itself. This algorithm stores move sequences based on what previous sequences were better, or caused cutoffs. This is therefore position independent and so it could also be useful in games with imperfect information or uncertainty, where the whole situation is not known at any one time. Over a small set of tests, the algorithm was shown to clearly out-perform Transposition Tables, both in terms of search reduction and game-play results.			arxiv	[]	173.0

The corresponding directed graph has only one directed cycle and only five terminal positions. It remains open: (i) if the number $n$ of the players can be reduced from $4$ to $3$, (ii) if the number $p$ of the terminals can be reduced from $5$ to $4$, and most important, (iii) whether it is possible to get a similar example in which the outcome $c$ corresponding to all (possibly, more than one) directed cycles is worse than every terminal for each player. Yet, it is known that (j) $n$ cannot be reduced to $2$, (jj) $p$ cannot be reduced to $3$, and (jjj) there can be no similar example in which each player makes a decision in a unique position.

The new sextant is comprised of six double-bend achromats (DBAs) with combined-function dipole-quadrupoles. Although the DBA design is widely utilized and well understood, the constraints for the CESR modifications make the CHESS-U lattice unique.

It can compress the introduction or description of a person or another named entity into a terse, poignant formulation and can best be explained by an example: When Norwegian world champion Magnus Carlsen is described as ""the Mozart of chess"", it is Vossian Antonomasia we are dealing with. The pattern is simple: A source (Mozart) is used to describe a target (Magnus Carlsen), the transfer of meaning is reached via a modifier (""of chess""). This phenomenon has been discussed before (as 'metaphorical antonomasia' or, with special focus on the source object, as 'paragons'), but no corpus-based approach has been undertaken as yet to explore its breadth and variety. We are looking into a full-text newspaper corpus (The New York Times, 1987-2007) and describe a new method for the automatic extraction of Vossian Antonomasia based on Wikidata entities.

427	Maharaja Nim, Wythoff's Queen meets the Knight	Urban Larsson	2012-07-03 17:49:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0765v1	New combinatorial games are introduced, of which the most pertinent is Maharaja Nim. The rules extend those of the well-known impartial game of Wythoff Nim in which two players take turn in moving a single Queen of Chess on a large board, attempting to be the first to put her in the lower left corner. Here, in addition to the classical rules a player may also move the Queen as the Knight of Chess moves. We prove that the second player's winning positions of Maharaja Nim are close to the ones of Wythoff Nim, namely they are within a bounded distance to the lines with slope $\frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$ respectively. For a close relative to Maharaja Nim, where the Knight's jumps are of the form $(2,3)$ and $(3,2)$ (rather than $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$), we also demonstrate polynomial time complexity to the decision problem of the outcome of a given position.			arxiv	['Johan Wästlund']	178.0
428	Learning Self-Game-Play Agents for Combinatorial Optimization Problems	Ruiyang Xu	2019-03-08 21:38:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03674v2	Recent progress in reinforcement learning (RL) using self-game-play has shown remarkable performance on several board games (e.g., Chess and Go) as well as video games (e.g., Atari games and Dota2). It is plausible to consider that RL, starting from zero knowledge, might be able to gradually approximate a winning strategy after a certain amount of training. In this paper, we explore neural Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search (neural MCTS), an RL algorithm which has been applied successfully by DeepMind to play Go and Chess at a super-human level. We try to leverage the computational power of neural MCTS to solve a class of combinatorial optimization problems. Following the idea of Hintikka's Game-Theoretical Semantics, we propose the Zermelo Gamification (ZG) to transform specific combinatorial optimization problems into Zermelo games whose winning strategies correspond to the solutions of the original optimization problem. The ZG also provides a specially designed neural MCTS. We use a combinatorial planning problem for which the ground-truth policy is efficiently computable to demonstrate that ZG is promising.			arxiv	['Karl Lieberherr']	179.0

This can be attributed to the fact that we do not experience quantum mechanics on a tangible level in our daily lives. Games can provide an environment in which people can experience the strange behavior of the quantum world in a fun and mentally engaging way. Games could also offer an interesting test bed for near term quantum devices because they can be tailored to support varying amounts of quantum behavior through simple rule changes, which can be useful when dealing with limited resources. This paper explores the design of a variant of Chess which is built on top of unitary dynamics and includes non-trivial quantum effects such as superposition, entanglement, and interference. A movement ruleset is introduced which allows players to create superposition, entanglement, and interference effects. A measurement rule is also introduced which helps limit the size of the superposition, so the game remains tractable for a classical computer, and also helps make the game more comprehensible for a player.			arxiv	[]	180.0
430	Decisions and Performance Under Bounded Rationality: A Computational Benchmarking Approach	Dainis Zegners	2020-05-26 11:39:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12638v2	This paper presents a novel approach to analyze human decision-making that involves comparing the behavior of professional chess players relative to a computational benchmark of cognitively bounded rationality. This benchmark is constructed using algorithms of modern chess engines and allows investigating behavior at the level of individual move-by-move observations, thus representing a natural benchmark for computationally bounded optimization. The analysis delivers novel insights by isolating deviations from this benchmark of bounded rationality as well as their causes and consequences for performance. The findings document the existence of several distinct dimensions of behavioral deviations, which are related to asymmetric positional evaluation in terms of losses and gains, time pressure, fatigue, and complexity. The results also document that deviations from the benchmark do not necessarily entail worse performance. Faster decisions are associated with more frequent deviations from the benchmark, yet they are also associated with better performance. The findings are consistent with an important influence of intuition and experience, thereby shedding new light on the recent debate about computational rationality in cognitive processes.			arxiv	['Uwe Sunde', 'Anthony Strittmatter']	181.0

Voice recordings were taken from 50 people (23 men and 27 women). While recording the sound, 29 words from each person were used which are determined as necessary for playing the game. Mel Frequency Coefficients (MFCC) and Gammatone Cepstral Coefficients (GTCC) qualification methods were used. In addition, k-NN, Naive Bayes and Neural Network classification methods were used for classification. Two different classification procedures were applied, namely, person-based and general. While the performance rate in person-based classification ranged from 75% to 98%, a performance over 84% was achieved in general classification.			arxiv	['Yakup Kutlu']	182.0
432	When Rooks Miss: Probability through Chess	Steven J. Miller	2021-05-10 14:24:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04398v1	A famous (and hard) chess problem asks what is the maximum number of safe squares possible in placing $n$ queens on an $n\times n$ board. We examine related problems from placing $n$ rooks. We prove that as $n\to\infty$, the probability rapidly tends to 1 that the fraction of safe squares from a random placement converges to $1/e^2$. Our interest in the problem is showing how to view the involved algebra to obtain the simple, closed form limiting fraction. In particular, we see the power of many of the key concepts in probability: binary indicator variables, linearity of expectation, variances and covariances, Chebyshev's inequality, and Stirling's formula.			arxiv	['Haoyu Sheng', 'Daniel Turek']	183.0
433	An Upper Bound on the State-Space Complexity of Brandubh	Kiernan Compy	2021-06-09 19:37:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05353v1	Before chess came to Northern Europe there was Tafl, a family of asymmetric strategy board games associated strongly with the Vikings. The purpose of this paper is to study the combinatorial state-space complexity of an Irish variation of Tafl called Brandubh. Brandubh was chosen because of its asymmetric goals for the two players, but also its overall complexity well below that of chess, which should make it tractable for strong solving. Brandubh's rules and characteristics are used to gain an understanding of the overall state-space complexity of the game. State-spaces will consider valid piece positions, a generalized rule set, and accepted final state conditions. From these states the upper bound for the complexity of strongly solving Brandubh is derived. Great effort has been placed on thoroughly accounting for all potential states and excluding invalid ones for the game. Overall, the upper bound complexity for solving the game is around 10^14 states, between that of connect four and draughts (checkers).			arxiv	['Alana Evey', 'Hunter McCullough', 'Lindsay Allen', 'Aaron S.

Move-by-move data provide exceptionally detailed and precise information about decision times and decision quality, based on a comparison of actual decisions to a computational benchmark of best moves constructed using the artificial intelligence of a chess engine. The results reveal that faster decisions are associated with better performance. The findings are consistent with the predictions of procedural decision models like drift-diffusion-models in which decision makers sequentially acquire information about decision alternatives with uncertain valuations.			arxiv	['Dainis Zegners', 'Anthony Strittmatter']	186.0

We gathered games of professional Shogi players from 1968 to 2019. The major findings are: (1) diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) reduces innate ability, which reduces the performance gap among same-age players; (2) players winning rates declined consistently from 20 years and as they get older; (3) AI accelerated the ageing declination of the probability of winning, which increased the performance gap among different aged players; (4) the effects of AI on the ageing declination and the probability of winning are observed for high innate skill players but not for low innate skill ones. This implies that the diffusion of AI hastens players retirement from active play, especially for those with high innate abilities. Thus, AI is a substitute for innate ability in brain-work productivity.			arxiv	['Ryohei Hayashi']	187.0
437	Word Play for Playing Othello (Reverses)	Samantha E. Miller Noever	2022-07-18 17:13:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08766v1	Language models like OpenAI's Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT-2/3) capture the long-term correlations needed to generate text in a variety of domains (such as language translators) and recently in gameplay (chess, Go, and checkers). The present research applies both the larger (GPT-3) and smaller (GPT-2) language models to explore the complex strategies for the game of Othello (or Reverses). Given the game rules for rapid reversals of fortune, the language model not only represents a candidate predictor of the next move based on previous game moves but also avoids sparse rewards in gameplay. The language model automatically captures or emulates championship-level strategies. The fine-tuned GPT-2 model generates Othello games ranging from 13-71% completion, while the larger GPT-3 model reaches 41% of a complete game. Like previous work with chess and Go, these language models offer a novel way to generate plausible game archives, particularly for comparing opening moves across a larger sample than humanly possible to explore. A primary contribution of these models magnifies (by two-fold) the previous record for player archives (120,000 human games over 45 years from 1977-2022), thus supplying the research community with more diverse and original strategies for sampling with other reinforcement learning techniques.			arxiv	['David Noever']	188.0
438	Supervised and Reinforcement Learning from Observations in Reconnaissance Blind Chess	Timo Bertram	2022-08-03 12:50:19	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02029v1	In this work, we adapt a training approach inspired by the original AlphaGo system to play the imperfect information game of Reconnaissance Blind Chess. Using only the observations instead of a full description of the game state, we first train a supervised agent on publicly available game records. Next, we increase the performance of the agent through self-play with the on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm Proximal Policy Optimization. We do not use any search to avoid problems caused by the partial observability of game states and only use the policy network to generate moves when playing. With this approach, we achieve an ELO of 1330 on the RBC leaderboard, which places our agent at position 27 at the time of this writing. We see that self-play significantly improves performance and that the agent plays acceptably well without search and without making assumptions about the true game state.			arxiv	['Johannes Fürnkranz', 'Martin Müller']	189.0

Landau called this ""relative Wertbemessung"", which translates to relative score. The basic idea from linear algebra behind this scoring system was rediscovered and reused in many contexts since 1895; in particular, it is a central ingredient in Google's PageRank."			arxiv	['Günter M.

The main challenge associated with self-learned agents in the form of deep neural networks, is their black-box nature: it is impossible for humans to interpret deep neural networks. Therefore, humans cannot directly interpret the actions of deep neural network based agents, or foresee their robustness in different scenarios. In this work, we demonstrate a method for probing which concepts self-learning agents internalise in the course of their training. For demonstration, we use a chess playing agent in a fast and light environment developed specifically to be suitable for research groups without access to enormous computational resources or machine learning models.			arxiv	['Inga Strümke']	191.0
441	The Swiss Gambit	Ágnes Cseh	2023-02-21 10:56:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10595v1	In each round of a Swiss-system tournament, players of similar score are paired against each other. An intentional early loss therefore might lead to weaker opponents in later rounds and thus to a better final tournament result - a phenomenon known as the Swiss Gambit. To the best of our knowledge it is an open question whether this strategy can actually work. This paper provides answers based on an empirical agent-based analysis for the most prominent application area of the Swiss-system format, namely chess tournaments. We simulate realistic tournaments by employing the official FIDE pairing system for computing the player pairings in each round. We show that even though gambits are widely possible in Swiss-system chess tournaments, profiting from them requires a high degree of predictability of match results. Moreover, even if a Swiss Gambit succeeds, the obtained improvement in the final ranking is limited. Our experiments prove that counting on a Swiss Gambit is indeed a lot more of a risky gambit than a reliable strategy to improve the final rank.			arxiv	['Pascal Führlich', 'Pascal Lenzner']	192.0

The paper introduces several collaboration models for programming alongside an AI, including the guidance model, the sketch model, and the inverted control model, and suggests that universities should prepare future programmers for a more efficient and productive programming environment augmented with AI. We hope to contribute to the important discussion about the diverse ways whereby humans and AI can work together in programming in the next decade, how universities should handle these changes and some legal implications surrounding this topic.			arxiv	['Bruno Pereira Cipriano']	193.0
443	Chess-board Acoustic Crystals with Momentum-space Nonsymmorphic Symmetries	Yanqiu Wang	2023-05-11 23:11:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07174v1	Spatial symmetries appearing in both real and momentum space are of fundamental significance to crystals. However, in the conventional framework, every space group in real space, either symmorphic or nonsymmorphic, corresponds to a symmorphic dual in momentum space. Our experiment breaks the framework by showing that in a 2D acoustic crystal with chess-board pattern of $\pi$ and 0 fluxes, mirror reflections are manifested nonsymmorphically as glide reflections in momentum space. These momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries stem from projective, rather than ordinary, representations of the real-space symmetries due to the peculiar flux pattern. Moreover, our experiment demonstrates that the glide reflection can reduce the topological type of the Brillouin zone from the torus to the Klein bottle, resulting in novel topological phases with new topological invariants. Since crystalline topologies are based on momentum-space symmetries, our work paves the way for utilizing engineerable gauge fluxes over artificial crystals to extend the current topological classifications into the broader regime of momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries.			arxiv	['Chen Zhang', 'Z.

Theoretical models of aging predict hazard curves that monotonically increase in time, in discrepancy with the peculiar ups and downs observed in empirically. Here we introduce the concept of co-aging, where the demographic trajectories of multiple cohorts couple together, and show that co-aging dynamics can account for the anomalous hazard curves exhibited by some species. In our model, multiple interdependency networks inflict damage on one other proportional to their number of functional nodes. We then fit our model predictions to three datasets describing (1) co-aging worm-pathogen populations (2) competing tree species. Lastly, we gather the mortality statistics of (3) machine-against-machine chess games to demonstrate that co-aging dynamics is not exclusive to biological systems.			arxiv	['Dervis C. Vural']	195.0

Ismail	2023-12-20 01:47:55	http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12700v1	In this note, I introduce Estimated Performance Rating (PR$^e$), a novel system for evaluating player performance in sports and games. PR$^e$ addresses a key limitation of the Tournament Performance Rating (TPR) system, which is undefined for zero or perfect scores in a series of games. PR$^e$ is defined as the rating that solves an optimization problem related to scoring probability, making it applicable for any performance level. The main theorem establishes that the PR$^e$ of a player is equivalent to the TPR whenever the latter is defined. I then apply this system to historically significant win-streaks in association football, tennis, and chess. Beyond sports, PR$^e$ has broad applicability in domains where Elo ratings are used, from college rankings to the evaluation of large language models.			arxiv	[]	196.0

Making use of the full HIFI spectrum of OMC-2 FIR 4 obtained in CHESS, we detected several ground-state lines from OH+, H2O+, HF, and CH+, all of them seen in absorption against the dust continuum emission of the protostar's envelope. The lines peak at a velocity of 9 km/s, which is blue-shifted by 2 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity of OMC-2 FIR 4 (V = 11.4 km/s). We derived column densities for each species, as well as an upper limit to the column density of the undetected H3O+. In order to model and characterise the foreground cloud, we used the Meudon PDR code to run a homogeneous grid of models that spans a reasonable range of densities, visual extinctions, cosmic ray ionisation rates and far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation fields. The results of our modelling indicate that the foreground cloud is composed of predominantly neutral diffuse gas (n(H) = 100 cm-3) and is heavily irradiated by an external source of FUV that most likely arises from the nearby Trapezium OB association. The cloud is 6 pc thick and bears many similarities with the so-called C+ interface between Orion-KL and the Trapezium cluster, 2 pc south of OMC-2 FIR 4. We conclude that the foreground cloud we detected is an extension of the C+ interface seen in the direction of Orion KL, and interpret it to be the remains of the parental cloud of OMC-1, which extends from OMC-1 up to OMC-2.			arxiv	['Mihkel Kama', 'Cecilia Ceccarelli', 'Carsten Dominik', 'Emmanuel Caux', 'Asunción Fuente', 'Tomás Alonso-Albi']	197.0
447	Learning Models of Individual Behavior in Chess	Reid McIlroy-Young	2020-08-23 18:24:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10086v3	AI systems that can capture human-like behavior are becoming increasingly useful in situations where humans may want to learn from these systems, collaborate with them, or engage with them as partners for an extended duration. In order to develop human-oriented AI systems, the problem of predicting human actions -- as opposed to predicting optimal actions -- has received considerable attention. Existing work has focused on capturing human behavior in an aggregate sense, which potentially limits the benefit any particular individual could gain from interaction with these systems. We extend this line of work by developing highly accurate predictive models of individual human behavior in chess. Chess is a rich domain for exploring human-AI interaction because it combines a unique set of properties: AI systems achieved superhuman performance many years ago, and yet humans still interact with them closely, both as opponents and as preparation tools, and there is an enormous corpus of recorded data on individual player games. Starting with Maia, an open-source version of AlphaZero trained on a population of human players, we demonstrate that we can significantly improve prediction accuracy of a particular player's moves by applying a series of fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, our personalized models can be used to perform stylometry -- predicting who made a given set of moves -- indicating that they capture human decision-making at an individual level. Our work demonstrates a way to bring AI systems into better alignment with the behavior of individual people, which could lead to large improvements in human-AI interaction.			arxiv	['Russell Wang', 'Siddhartha Sen', 'Jon Kleinberg', 'Ashton Anderson']	198.0

Previous research has developed parallel versions of MCTS, exploiting today's multiprocessing architectures. These studies focused on versions of MCTS for the discrete case. Our work builds upon existing parallelization strategies and extends them to continuous domains. In particular, leaf parallelization and root parallelization are studied and two final selection strategies that are required to handle continuous states in root parallelization are proposed. The evaluation of the resulting parallelized continuous MCTS is conducted using a challenging cooperative multi-agent system trajectory planning task in the domain of automated vehicles.			arxiv	['Christoph Hörtnagl', 'J.

This is a step towards establishing Simplified Boardgames as a comparison class for General Game Playing agents. To generate playable, human readable, and balanced chess-like games we use an adaptive evolutionary algorithm with the fitness function based on simulated playouts. In future, we plan to use the proposed method to diversify and extend the set of GGP tournament games by those with fully automatically generated rules.			arxiv	['Marek Szykuła']	210.0

461	A note on the empirical comparison of RBG and Ludii	Jakub Kowalski	2019-10-01 11:24:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00309v2	We present an experimental comparison of the efficiency of three General Game Playing systems in their current versions: Regular Boardgames (RBG 1.0), Ludii~0.3.0, and a Game Description Language (GDL) propnet. We show that in general, RBG is currently the fastest GGP system. For example, for chess, we demonstrate that RBG is about 37 times faster than Ludii, and Ludii is about 3 times slower than a GDL propnet. Referring to the recent comparison [An Empirical Evaluation of Two General Game Systems: Ludii and RBG, CoG 2019], we show evidences that the benchmark presented there contains a number of significant flaws that lead to wrong conclusions.			arxiv	['Maksymilian Mika', 'Jakub Sutowicz', 'Marek Szykuła']	212.0
462	Finding optimal strategies in sequential games with the novel selection monad	Johannes Hartmann	2021-05-26 12:33:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12514v1	The recently discovered monad, Tx = Selection (x -> r) -> r, provides an elegant way to finnd optimal strategies in sequential games. During this thesis, a library was developed which provides a set of useful functions using the selection monad to compute optimal games and AIs for sequential games. In order to explore the selection monads ability to support these AI implementations, three example case studies were developed using Haskell: The two-player game Connect Four, a Sudoku solver and a simplified version of Chess. These case studies show how to elegantly implement a game AI. Furthermore, a performance analysis of these case studies was done, identifying the major points where performance can be increased.			arxiv	[]	213.0

We motivated and applied a SOTA actor-critic method Proximal Policy Optimization with Generalized Advantage Estimation. Our initial task centered around training the agent against a random agent. Once we obtained reasonable performance, we then adopted a version of iterative policy improvement adopted by AlphaGo to pit the agent against increasingly stronger versions of itself, and evaluate the resulting performance gain. The final agent achieves a near (.97) perfect win rate against a random agent. We also explore the effects of pretraining the network using a collection of positions obtained via self-play.			arxiv	['Robert Tan']	214.0

A win rewards a player with 1 points, a draw with 1/2 point, and a loss with 0 points. We are interested in the distribution of the scores associated with ranks of $n$ players after ${\displaystyle {n \choose 2}}$ games, i.e. the distribution of the maximal score, second maximum, and so on. The exact distribution for a general $n$ seems impossible to obtain; we obtain a limit distribution.			arxiv	[]	215.0

Unlike a monolithic approach, the hydrodynamics and electromagnetic field are handled by separate solvers, all developed within the Center for Hypersonics and Entry Systems Studies (CHESS) at the University of Illinois. Hydrodynamics is modeled using HEGEL , a finite volume solver for non-equilibrium plasmas. This solver is interfaced with the PLATO library, which is responsible for evaluating all plasma-related quantities (e.g., thermodynamic and transport properties). The electric field is handled by FLUX , a finite element solver. Coupling is realized using the PRE CICE open-source library. Applications are here presented and discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling strategy.			arxiv	['Sanjeev Kumar', 'Marco Panesi']	219.0
469	Solving Abalone on Small Boards	Joseph Gutstadt	2023-08-06 20:54:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03208v1	Abalone is a 2-player board game with perfect information. The game is played on a 5x5x5 hexagonal grid and ends when a player pushes 6 of their opponents' pieces off the board. Abalone is similar to games like chess and Go in that all three games have high branching factors, making it difficult for a computer to determine the outcome of a game. However, solving smaller, simplified versions of Abalone can offer insight into how to play the full-size game optimally. In this paper, we strongly solve a variation of Abalone played on a 2x2x2 hexagonal board. We also weakly solve an Abalone variation on a 2x2x3 hexagonal board.			arxiv	['Kirsten Hogenson', 'John Koerner']	220.0

472	Upper limit for the D2H+ ortho-to-para ratio in the prestellar core 16293E (CHESS)	C. Vastel	2012-10-02 15:23:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0804v2	The H3+ ion plays a key role in the chemistry of dense interstellar gas clouds where stars and planets are forming. The low temperatures and high extinctions of such clouds make direct observations of H3+ impossible, but lead to large abundances of H2D+ and D2H+, which are very useful probes of the early stages of star and planet formation. The ground-state rotational ortho-D2H+ 111-000 transition at 1476.6 GHz in the prestellar core 16293E has been searched for with the Herschel/HIFI instrument, within the CHESS (Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions) Key Program. The line has not been detected at the 21 mK km/s level (3 sigma integrated line intensity). We used the ortho-H2D+ 110-111 transition and para-D2H+ 110-101 transition detected in this source to determine an upper limit on the ortho-to-para D2H+ ratio as well as the para-D2H+/ortho-H2D+ ratio from a non-LTE analysis. The comparison between our chemical modeling and the observations suggests that the CO depletion must be high (larger than 100), with a density between 5e5 and 1e6 cm-3. Also the upper limit on the ortho-D2H+ line is consistent with a low gas temperature (~ 11 K) with a ortho-to-para ratio of 6 to 9, i.e. 2 to 3 times higher than the value estimated from the chemical modeling, making it impossible to detect this high frequency transition with the present state of the art receivers.			arxiv	['P.

473	How Relevant Are Chess Composition Conventions?	Azlan Iqbal	2013-09-12 06:00:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3039v2	Composition conventions are guidelines used by human composers in composing chess problems. They are particularly significant in composition tournaments. Examples include, not having any check in the first move of the solution and not dressing up the board with unnecessary pieces. Conventions are often associated or even directly conflated with the overall aesthetics or beauty of a composition. Using an existing experimentally-validated computational aesthetics model for three-move mate problems, we analyzed sets of computer-generated compositions adhering to at least 2, 3 and 4 comparable conventions to test if simply conforming to more conventions had a positive effect on their aesthetics, as is generally believed by human composers. We found slight but statistically significant evidence that it does, but only to a point. We also analyzed human judge scores of 145 three-move mate problems composed by humans to see if they had any positive correlation with the computational aesthetic scores of those problems. We found that they did not. These seemingly conflicting findings suggest two main things. First, the right amount of adherence to composition conventions in a composition has a positive effect on its perceived aesthetics. Second, human judges either do not look at the same conventions related to aesthetics in the model used or emphasize others that have less to do with beauty as perceived by the majority of players, even though they may mistakenly consider their judgements beautiful in the traditional, non-esoteric sense. Human judges may also be relying significantly on personal tastes as we found no correlation between their individual scores either.			arxiv	[]	224.0

In this article, we give very simple always winning strategies for the first player if n is 4 or odd. The additionally (in the source package) provided computer program QPGAME3 has been used to check that there are successful strategies for the first player if n is 6 or 8, and for the second player if n is 10, 12, 14, or 16.

475	A New Paradigm for Minimax Search	Aske Plaat	2014-04-05 20:05:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1515v1	This paper introduces a new paradigm for minimax game-tree search algo- rithms. MT is a memory-enhanced version of Pearls Test procedure. By changing the way MT is called, a number of best-first game-tree search algorithms can be simply and elegantly constructed (including SSS*). Most of the assessments of minimax search algorithms have been based on simulations. However, these simulations generally do not address two of the key ingredients of high performance game-playing programs: iterative deepening and memory usage. This paper presents experimental data from three game-playing programs (checkers, Othello and chess), covering the range from low to high branching factor. The improved move ordering due to iterative deepening and memory usage results in significantly different results from those portrayed in the literature. Whereas some simulations show Alpha-Beta expanding almost 100% more leaf nodes than other algorithms [12], our results showed variations of less than 20%. One new instance of our framework (MTD-f) out-performs our best alpha- beta searcher (aspiration NegaScout) on leaf nodes, total nodes and execution time. To our knowledge, these are the first reported results that compare both depth-first and best-first algorithms given the same amount of memory			arxiv	['Jonathan Schaeffer', 'Wim Pijls', 'Arie de Bruin']	226.0

As part of the CHESS (Chemical Herschel Survey of Star Forming Regions) Key Programme, AFGL 2591 was observed by the Herschel/HIFI instrument. The spectral survey covered a frequency range from 480 up to 1240 GHz as well as single lines from 1267 to 1901 GHz (i.e. CO, HCl, NH3, OH and [CII]). Rotational and population diagram methods were used to calculate column densities, excitation temperatures and the emission extents of the observed molecules associated with AFGL 2591. The analysis was supplemented with several lines from ground-based JCMT spectra. From the HIFI spectral survey analysis a total of 32 species were identified (including isotopologues). In spite of the fact that lines are mostly quite week, 268 emission and 16 absorption lines were found (excluding blends). Molecular column densities range from 6e11 to 1e19 cm-2 and excitation temperatures range from 19 to 175 K. One can distinguish cold (e.g. HCN, H2S, NH3 with temperatures below 70 K) and warm species (e.g. CH3OH, SO2) in the protostellar envelope.			arxiv	['F. F. S. van der Tak', 'F. P. Helmich', 'L.

The placement strategies adopted by Weiqi players are often used to analog the philosophy of human wars. Contrary to the western chess, Weiqi games are less studied by academics partially because Weiqi is popular only in East Asia, especially in China, Japan and Korea. Here, we propose to construct a directed tree using a database of extensive Weiqi games and perform a quantitative analysis of the Weiqi tree. We find that the popularity distribution of Weiqi openings with a same number of moves is distributed according to a power law and the tail exponent increases with the number of moves. Intriguingly, the superposition of the popularity distributions of Weiqi openings with the number of moves no more than a given number also has a power-law tail in which the tail exponent increases with the number of moves, and the superposed distribution approaches to the Zipf law. These findings are the same as for chess and support the conjecture that the popularity distribution of board game openings follows the Zipf law with a universal exponent. We also find that the distribution of out-degrees has a power-law form, the distribution of branching ratios has a very complicated pattern, and the distribution of uniqueness scores defined by the path lengths from the root vertex to the leaf vertices exhibits a unimodal shape. Our work provides a promising direction for the study of the decision making process of Weiqi playing from the angle of directed branching tree.			arxiv	['Ming-Xia Li', 'Wei-Xing Zhou']	228.0

The method involves mechanical geometry as well as an optimized deployment algorithm. The geometry is found to be simple for mechanical implementation. The algorithm initially assigns the IFUs to the target objects and then devises the movement sequence based on the current and the desired IFU positions. The reconfiguration time using the suitable actuators which runs at 20 cm/s is found to be a maximum of 25 seconds for the circular DOTIFS focal plane (180 mm diameter). The Geometry Algorithm Combination (GAC) has been tested on several million mock target configurations with object-to-IFU ({\tau} ) ratio varying from 0.25 to 16. The MRC method is found to-be efficient in target acquisition in terms of field revisit and deployment time without any collision or entanglement of the fiber bundles. The efficiency of the technique does not get affected by the increase in number density of target objects. The technique is compared with other available methods based on sky coverage, flexibility and overhead time. The proposed geometry and algorithm combination is found to have an advantage in all of the aspects.			arxiv	['A. N.

479	An Algorithm for Automatically Updating a Forsyth-Edwards Notation String Without an Array Board Representation	Azlan Iqbal	2020-09-02 09:13:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03193v2	We present an algorithm that correctly updates the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) chessboard character string after any move is made without the need for an intermediary array representation of the board. In particular, this relates to software that have to do with chess, certain chess variants and possibly even similar board games with comparable position representation. Even when performance may be equal or inferior to using arrays, the algorithm still provides an accurate and viable alternative to accomplishing the same thing, or when there may be a need for additional or side processing in conjunction with arrays. Furthermore, the end result (i.e. an updated FEN string) is immediately ready for export to any other internal module or external program, unlike with an intermediary array which needs to be first converted into a FEN string for export purposes. The algorithm is especially useful when there are no existing array-based modules to represent a visual board as it can do without them entirely. We provide examples that demonstrate the correctness of the algorithm given a variety of positions involving castling, en passant and pawn promotion.			arxiv	[]	230.0

Caravaca	2016-10-06 17:53:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02029v3	The ability to separately identify the Cherenkov and scintillation light components produced in scintillating mediums holds the potential for a major breakthrough in neutrino detection technology, allowing development of a large, low-threshold, directional detector with a broad physics program. The CHESS (CHErenkov / Scintillation Separation) experiment employs an innovative detector design with an array of small, fast photomultiplier tubes and state-of-the-art electronics to demonstrate the reconstruction of a Cherenkov ring in a scintillating medium based on photon hit time and detected photoelectron density. This paper describes the physical properties and calibration of CHESS along with first results. The ability to reconstruct Cherenkov rings is demonstrated in a water target, and a time precision of 338 +/- 12 ps FWHM is achieved. Monte Carlo based predictions for the ring imaging sensitivity with a liquid scintillator target predict an efficiency for identifying Cherenkov hits of 94 +/- 1% and 81 +/- 1% in pure linear alkyl benzene (LAB) and LAB loaded with 2 g/L of PPO, respectively, with a scintillation contamination of 12 +/- 1% and 26 +/- 1%.			arxiv	['F.

In this study, We train a version of the GPT-2 on a corpora of historical chess games, and then ""launch"" clusters of synthetic agents into the model, using text strings to create context and orientation. We compare the trajectories contained in the text generated by the agents/model and compare that to the known ground truth of the chess board, move legality, and historical patterns of play. We find that the percentages of moves by piece using the model are substantially similar from human patterns. We further find that the model creates an accurate latent representation of the chessboard, and that it is possible to plot trajectories of legal moves across the board using this knowledge."			arxiv	['Antonio Bucchiarone']	232.0

Recently Reinforcement Learning algorithms for hedging under realistic market conditions have attracted significant interest. While research in the derivatives area mostly focused on variations of $Q$-learning, in artificial intelligence Monte Carlo Tree Search is the recognized state-of-the-art method for various planning problems, such as the games of Hex, Chess, Go,... This article introduces Monte Carlo Tree Search as a method to solve the stochastic optimal control problem behind the pricing and hedging tasks. As compared to $Q$-learning it combines Reinforcement Learning with tree search techniques. As a consequence Monte Carlo Tree Search has higher sample efficiency, is less prone to over-fitting to specific market models and generally learns stronger policies faster. In our experiments we find that Monte Carlo Tree Search, being the world-champion in games like Chess and Go, is easily capable of maximizing the utility of investor's terminal wealth without setting up an auxiliary mathematical framework.			arxiv	[]	233.0
483	On Evaluating Self-Adaptive and Self-Healing Systems using Chaos Engineering	Moeen Ali Naqvi	2022-08-28 14:38:57	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13227v1	With the growing adoption of self-adaptive systems in various domains, there is an increasing need for strategies to assess their correct behavior. In particular self-healing systems, which aim to provide resilience and fault-tolerance, often deal with unanticipated failures in critical and highly dynamic environments. Their reactive and complex behavior makes it challenging to assess if these systems execute according to the desired goals. Recently, several studies have expressed concern about the lack of systematic evaluation methods for self-healing behavior. In this paper, we propose CHESS, an approach for the systematic evaluation of self-adaptive and self-healing systems that builds on chaos engineering. Chaos engineering is a methodology for subjecting a system to unexpected conditions and scenarios. It has shown great promise in helping developers build resilient microservice architectures and cyber-physical systems. CHESS turns this idea around by using chaos engineering to evaluate how well a self-healing system can withstand such perturbations. We investigate the viability of this approach through an exploratory study on a self-healing smart office environment. The study helps us explore the promises and limitations of the approach, as well as identify directions where additional work is needed. We conclude with a summary of lessons learned.			arxiv	['Sehrish Malik', 'Merve Astekin', 'Leon Moonen']	234.0
484	Evaluating Superhuman Models with Consistency Checks	Lukas Fluri	2023-06-16 17:26:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09983v3	If machine learning models were to achieve superhuman abilities at various reasoning or decision-making tasks, how would we go about evaluating such models, given that humans would necessarily be poor proxies for ground truth? In this paper, we propose a framework for evaluating superhuman models via consistency checks. Our premise is that while the correctness of superhuman decisions may be impossible to evaluate, we can still surface mistakes if the model's decisions fail to satisfy certain logical, human-interpretable rules. We instantiate our framework on three tasks where correctness of decisions is hard to evaluate due to either superhuman model abilities, or to otherwise missing ground truth: evaluating chess positions, forecasting future events, and making legal judgments. We show that regardless of a model's (possibly superhuman) performance on these tasks, we can discover logical inconsistencies in decision making. For example: a chess engine assigning opposing valuations to semantically identical boards; GPT-4 forecasting that sports records will evolve non-monotonically over time; or an AI judge assigning bail to a defendant only after we add a felony to their criminal record.			arxiv	['Daniel Paleka', 'Florian Tramèr']	235.0
485	Is mathematics a game?	Klaas Landsman	2023-11-21 09:41:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12478v1	"We re-examine the old question to what extent mathematics may be compared to a game. Under the spell of Wittgenstein, we propose that the more refined object of comparison is a ""motley of language games"", the nature of which was (implicitly) clarified by Hilbert: via different language games, axiomatization lies at the basis of both the rigour and the applicability of mathematics. In the ""formalist"" game, mathematics resembles chess via a clear conceptual dictionary. Accepting this resemblance: like positions in chess, mathematical sentences cannot be true or false; true statements in mathematics are about sentences, namely that they are theorems (if they are). In principle, the certainty of mathematics resides in proofs, but to this end, in practice these must be ""surveyable"". Hilbert and Wittgenstein proposed almost oppositie criteria for surveyability; we try to overcome their difference by invoking computer-verified proofs. The ""applied""' language game is based on Hilbert's axiomatization program for physics (and other scientific disciplines), refined by Wittgenstein's idea that theorems are yardsticks to which empirical phenomena may be compared, and further improved by invoking elements of van Fraassen's constructive empiricism. From this perspective, in an appendix we also briefly review the varying roles and structures of axioms, definitions, and proofs in mathematics. Our view is not meant as a philosophy of mathematics by itself, but as a coat rack analogous to category theory, onto which various (traditional and new) philosophies of mathematics (such as formalism, intuitionism, structuralism, deductivism, and the philosophy of mathematical practice) may be attached and may even peacefully support each other."			arxiv	['Kirti Singh']	236.0

We use morphological star/galaxy separation, an SDSS quasar catalog, an optical color-magnitude cut, and X-ray data quality tests to create our catalog, the ChaMP Extended Stellar Survey (ChESS), from a sample of 2121 matched ChaMP/SDSS sources. Our cuts retain 92% of the spectroscopically confirmed stars while excluding 99.6% of the 684 spectoscopically confirmed extragalactic sources. Fewer than 3% of the sources in our final catalog are previously identified stellar X-ray emitters; we expect ~10% of the catalog is composed by giants, and identify seven giant stars and three cataclysmic variables. We derive distances, X-ray and bolometric luminosities for these stars, revealing that this catalog fills the gap between the nearby stars identified by the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and the more distant stars detected in deep Chandra and XMM-Newton surveys. For 36 newly identified X-ray emitting M stars we calculate L_(Halpha)/L_(bol). L_(H\alpha)/L_(bol) and L_(X)/L_(bol) are linearly related below L_(X)/L_(bol) ~ 3 x 10^(-4), while L_(Halpha)/L_(bol) appears to turn over at larger L_(X)/L_(bol) values. Stars with reliable SDSS photometry have an ~0.1 mag blue excess in (u-g), likely due to increased chromospheric continuum emission. Photometric metallicity estimates suggest the sample is split between the young and old disk populations of the Galaxy; the lowest activity sources belong to the old disk population, a clear signature of the decay of magnetic activity with age. Future papers will present analyses of source variability and comparisons of this catalog to models of stellar activity in the Galactic disk.			arxiv	['M. A. Agueros', 'P. J. Green', 'D.

487	The CHESS survey of the L1157-B1 shock: the dissociative jet shock as revealed by Herschel--PACS	Milena Benedettini	2012-02-07 15:58:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1451v1	"Outflows generated by protostars heavily affect the kinematics and chemistry of the hosting molecular cloud through strong shocks that enhance the abundance of some molecules. L1157 is the prototype of chemically active outflows, and a strong shock, called B1, is taking place in its blue lobe between the precessing jet and the hosting cloud. We present the Herschel-PACS 55--210 micron spectra of the L1157-B1 shock, showing emission lines from CO, H2O, OH, and [OI]. The spatial resolution of the PACS spectrometer allows us to map the warm gas traced by far-infrared (FIR) lines with unprecedented detail. The rotational diagram of the high-Jup CO lines indicates high-excitation conditions (Tex ~ 210 +/- 10 K). We used a radiative transfer code to model the hot CO gas emission observed with PACS and in the CO (13-12) and (10-9) lines measured by Herschel-HIFI. We derive 200<Tkin<800 K and n>10^5 cm-3. The CO emission comes from a region of about 7 arcsec located at the rear of the bow shock where the [OI] and OH emission also originate. Comparison with shock models shows that the bright [OI] and OH emissions trace a dissociative J-type shock, which is also supported by a previous detection of [FeII] at the same position. The inferred mass-flux is consistent with the ""reverse"" shock where the jet is impacting on the L1157-B1 bow shock. The same shock may contribute significantly to the high-Jup CO emission."			arxiv	['Gemma Busquet', 'Bertrand Lefloch', 'Claudio Codella', 'Silvie Cabrit', 'Cecilia Ceccarelli', 'Teresa Giannini', 'Brunella Nisini', 'Magda Vasta', 'Jose Cernicharo', 'Andrea Lorenzani', 'Anna Maria di Giorgio', 'the CHESS team']	238.0
488	The CHESS survey of the L1157-B1 shock region: CO spectral signatures of jet-driven bowshocks	B. Lefloch	2012-08-20 23:40:04	http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4140v1	The unprecedented sensitivity of Herschel coupled with the high resolution of the HIFI spectrometer permits studies of the intensity-velocity relationship I(v) in molecular outflows, over a higher excitation range than possible up to now. In the course of the CHESS Key Program, we have observed toward the bright bowshock region L1157-B1 the CO rotational transitions between J=5-4 and J=16-15 with HIFI, and the J=1-0, 2-1 and 3-2 with the IRAM-30m and the CSO telescopes. We find that all the line profiles I_{CO}(v) are well fit by a linear combination of three exponential laws exp(-|v/v_0|) with v_0= 12.5, 4.4 and 2.5km/s. The first component dominates the CO emission at J_up > 13, as well as the high-excitation lines of SiO and H2O. The second component dominates for 3 < J_up < 10 and the third one for J_up < 2. We show that these exponentials are the signature of quasi-isothermal shocked gas components: the impact of the jet against the L1157-B1 bowshock (T= 210K), the walls of the outflow cavity associated with B1 (T= 64K) and the older cavity L1157-B2 (T= 23K), respectively. Analysis of the CO line flux in the Large-Velocity Gradient approximation further shows that the emission arises from dense gas (n(H2) > 1e5-1e6 cm-3) close to LTE up to J=20. We find that the CO J=2-1 intensity-velocity relation observed in various other molecular outflows is satisfactorily fit by similar exponential laws, which may hold an important clue to their entrainment process.			arxiv	['S.

489	The Herschel/HIFI spectral survey of OMC-2 FIR 4 (CHESS): An overview of the 480 to 1902 GHz range	M. Kama	2013-05-28 09:17:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6421v1	Broadband spectral surveys of protostars offer a rich view of the physical, chemical and dynamical structure and evolution of star-forming regions. The Herschel Space Observatory opened up the terahertz regime to such surveys, giving access to the fundamental transitions of many hydrides and to the high-energy transitions of many other species. A comparative analysis of the chemical inventories and physical processes and properties of protostars of various masses and evolutionary states is the goal of the Herschel CHEmical Surveys of Star forming regions (CHESS) key program. This paper focusses on the intermediate-mass protostar, OMC-2 FIR 4. We obtained a spectrum of OMC-2 FIR 4 in the 480 to 1902 GHz range with the HIFI spectrometer onboard Herschel and carried out the reduction, line identification, and a broad analysis of the line profile components, excitation, and cooling. We detect 719 spectral lines from 40 species and isotopologs. The line flux is dominated by CO, H2O, and CH3OH. The line profiles are complex and vary with species and upper level energy, but clearly contain signatures from quiescent gas, a broad component likely due to an outflow, and a foreground cloud. We find abundant evidence for warm, dense gas, as well as for an outflow in the field of view. Line flux represents 2% of the 7 L_Sol luminosity detected with HIFI in the 480 to 1250 GHz range. Of the total line flux, 60% is from CO, 13% from H2O and 9% from CH3OH. A comparison with similar HIFI spectra of other sources is set to provide much new insight into star formation regions, a case in point being a difference of two orders of magnitude in the relative contribution of sulphur oxides to the line cooling of Orion KL and OMC-2 FIR 4.			arxiv	['A.

490	Ryuo Nim: A Variant of the classical game of Wythoff Nim	Ryohei Miyadera	2017-11-04 08:03:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01411v1	The authors introduce the impartial game of the generalized Ry\=u\=o Nim, a variant of the classical game of Wythoff Nim. In the latter game, two players take turns in moving a single queen on a large chessboard, attempting to be the first to put her in the upper left corner, position $(0,0)$. Instead of the queen used in Wythoff Nim, we use the generalized Ry\=u\=o for a given natural number $p$. The generalized Ry\=u\=o for $p$ can be moved horizontally and vertically, as far as one wants. It also can be moved diagonally from $(x,y)$ to $(x-s,y-t)$, where $s,t$ are non-negative integers such that $1 \leq s \leq x, 1 \leq t \leq y \textit{and} s+t \leq p-1$. When $p$ is $3$, the generalized Ry\=u\=o for $p$ is a Ry\=u\=o, i.e., a promoted hisha piece of Japanese chess. A Ry\=u\=o combines the power of the rook and the king in Western chess. The generalized Ry\=u\=o Nim for $p$ is mathematically the same as the Nim with two piles of counters in which a player may take any number from either heap, and a player may also simultaneously remove $s$ counters from either of the piles and $t$ counters from the other, where $s+t \leq p-1$ and $p$ is a given natural number. The Grundy number of the generalized Ry\=u\=o Nim for $p$ is given by $\bmod(x+y,p) + p(\lfloor \frac{x}{p} \rfloor \oplus \lfloor \frac{y}{p}\rfloor)$. The authors also study the generalized Ry\=u\=o Nim for $p$ with a pass move. The generalized Ry\=u\=o Nim for $p$ without a pass move has simple formulas for Grundy numbers. This is not the case after the introduction of a pass move, but it still has simple formulas for the previous player's positions. We also study the Ry\=u\=o Nim that restricted the diagonal and side movement. Moreover, we extended the Ry\=u\=o Nim dimension to the $n$-dimension.			arxiv	['Yuki Tokuni', 'Yushi Nakaya', 'Masanori Fukui', 'Tomoaki Abuku', 'Koki Suetsugu']	241.0
491	Revisiting the Temperature of the Diffuse ISM with CHESS Sounding Rocket Observations	Nicholas Kruczek	2019-05-09 17:59:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03781v1	Measuring the temperature and abundance patterns of clouds in the interstellar medium (ISM) provides an observational basis for models of the physical conditions within the clouds, which play an important role in studies of star and planet formation. The Colorado High-resolution Echelle Stellar Spectrograph (CHESS) is a far ultraviolet rocket-borne instrument designed to study the atomic-to-molecular transitions within diffuse molecular and translucent cloud regions. The final two flights of the instrument observed $\beta^{1}$ Scorpii ($\beta$ Sco) and $\gamma$ Arae. We present flight results of interstellar molecular hydrogen (H$_{\rm 2}$) excitation on the sightlines, including measurements of the column densities and temperatures. These results are compared to previous values that were measured using the damping wings of low J$^{\prime \prime}$ H$_{\rm 2}$ absorption features (Savage et al. 1977). For $\beta$ Sco, we find that the derived column density of the J$^{\prime \prime}$ = 1 rotational level differs by a factor of 2-3 when compared to the previous observations. We discuss the discrepancies between the two measurements and show that the source of the difference is due to the opacity of higher rotational levels contributing to the J$^{\prime \prime}$ = 1 absorption wing, increasing the inferred column density in the previous work. We extend this analysis to 9 $Copernicus$ and 13 $FUSE$ spectra to explore the interdependence of the column densities of different rotational levels and how the H$_{\rm 2}$ kinetic temperature is influenced by these relationships. We find a revised average gas kinetic temperature of the diffuse molecular ISM of T$_{01}$ = 68 $\pm$ 13 K, 12% lower than the value found previously.			arxiv	['Kevin France', 'Keri Hoadley', 'Brian Fleming', 'Nicholas Nell']	242.0
492	The reconstruction of Ni and Rh (001) surfaces upon Carbon, Nitrogen, or Oxygen adsorption	Dario Alfe`	1998-12-02 12:23:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9812038v1	Nickel and Rhodium (001) surfaces display a similar - as from STM images - clock reconstruction when half a monolayer of C/Ni, N/Ni or O/Rh is adsorbed; no reconstruction is observed instead for O/Ni. Adsorbate atoms sit at the center of the black squares of a chess-board, $c(2\times 2)$, pattern and two different reconstructions are actually compatible with the observed STM images - showing a $(2\times 2)p4g$ pattern - according to whether a rotation of the black or white squares occurs. We report on a first - principles study of the structure of X/Ni(001) and X/Rh(001) surfaces (X=C,N,O) at half a monolayer coverage, performed using density-functional theory. Our findings are in agreement with all available experimental information and shed new light on the mechanisms responsible for the reconstructions. We show that the same substrate may display different reconstructions - or no reconstruction - upon adsorption of different atomic species, depending on the relative importance of the chemical and steric factors which determine the reconstruction.			arxiv	['Stefano de Gironcoli', 'Stefano Baroni']	243.0
493	Kondo effect in multielectron quantum dots at high magnetic fields	C. Tejedor	2000-03-15 12:00:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0003261v2	We present a general description of low temperature transport through a quantum dot with any number of electrons at filling factor $1<\nu <2$. We provide a general description of a novel Kondo effect which is turned on by application of an appropriate magnetic field. The spin-flip scattering of carriers by the quantum dot only involves two states of the scatterer which may have a large spin. This process is described by spin-flip Hubbard operators, which change the angular momentum, leading to a Kondo Hamiltonian. We obtain antiferromagnetic exchange couplings depending on tunneling amplitudes and correlation effects. Since Kondo temperature has an exponential dependence on exchange couplings, quantitative variations of the parameters in different regimes have important experimental consequences. In particular, we discuss the {\it chess board} aspect of the experimental conductance when represented in a grey scale as a function of both the magnetic field and the gate potential affecting the quantum dot.			arxiv	['L.

494	Self-consistent approach for thermodynamics of a simplified pseudospin-electron model	I. V. Stasyuk	2000-10-22 09:35:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0010334v1	We present the method of the self-consistent calculation of thermodynamical and correlation functions. This approach is based on the GRPA (generalized random phase approximation) scheme with the inclusion of the mean field corrections. Investigation of a pseudospin-electron model (PEM) within the framework of the presented method shows that interaction between the electron and pseudospin subsystems leads to the possibility of either first or second order phase transitions between different uniform phases (bistability) as well as between the uniform and the chess-board ones. In the regime n=const, an instability with respect to phase separation in the electron and pseudospin subsystems can take place.			arxiv	['A. M. Shvaika', 'K. V. Tabunshchyk']	245.0
495	On the sign-imbalance of partition shapes	Jonas Sjöstrand	2003-09-15 09:19:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0309231v3	Let the sign of a standard Young tableau be the sign of the permutation you get by reading it row by row from left to right, like a book. A conjecture by Richard Stanley says that the sum of the signs of all SYTs with n squares is 2^[n/2]. We present a stronger theorem with a purely combinatorial proof using the Robinson-Schensted correspondence and a new concept called chess tableaux. We also prove a sharpening of another conjecture by Stanley concerning weighted sums of squares of sign-imbalances. The proof is built on a remarkably simple relation between the sign of a permutation and the signs of its RS-corresponding tableaux.			arxiv	[]	246.0
496	Social Learning Methods in Board Games	Vukosi N. Marivate	2008-10-20 07:04:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3474v1	This paper discusses the effects of social learning in training of game playing agents. The training of agents in a social context instead of a self-play environment is investigated. Agents that use the reinforcement learning algorithms are trained in social settings. This mimics the way in which players of board games such as scrabble and chess mentor each other in their clubs. A Round Robin tournament and a modified Swiss tournament setting are used for the training. The agents trained using social settings are compared to self play agents and results indicate that more robust agents emerge from the social training setting. Higher state space games can benefit from such settings as diverse set of agents will have multiple strategies that increase the chances of obtaining more experienced players at the end of training. The Social Learning trained agents exhibit better playing experience than self play agents. The modified Swiss playing style spawns a larger number of better playing agents as the population size increases.			arxiv	['Tshilidzi Marwala']	247.0

Kallah is an old African game, its rules are simple but the strategies to be used are very complex to implement. Of course, they are based on a strongly mathematical basis as in the film ""Rain-Man"" where one can see that gambling can be payed with strategies based on mathematical theories. The Artificial Intelligence gives the possibility ""of thinking"" to a machine and, therefore, allows it to make decisions. In our work, we use it to give the means to the computer choosing its best movement."			arxiv	[]	248.0

In this paper we present a new indexing approach, FastLMFI for local maximal frequent patterns (itemset) propagation and maximal patterns superset checking. Experimental results on different sparse and dense datasets show that our work is better than the previous well known progressive focusing technique. We have also integrated our superset checking approach with an existing state of the art maximal itemsets algorithm Mafia, and compare our results with current best maximal itemsets algorithms afopt-max and FP (zhu)-max. Our results outperform afopt-max and FP (zhu)-max on dense (chess and mushroom) datasets on almost all support thresholds, which shows the effectiveness of our approach.			arxiv	['Abdul Rauf Baig']	249.0
499	Open Problems in Universal Induction & Intelligence	Marcus Hutter	2009-07-04 08:45:22	http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0746v1	Specialized intelligent systems can be found everywhere: finger print, handwriting, speech, and face recognition, spam filtering, chess and other game programs, robots, et al. This decade the first presumably complete mathematical theory of artificial intelligence based on universal induction-prediction-decision-action has been proposed. This information-theoretic approach solidifies the foundations of inductive inference and artificial intelligence. Getting the foundations right usually marks a significant progress and maturing of a field. The theory provides a gold standard and guidance for researchers working on intelligent algorithms. The roots of universal induction have been laid exactly half-a-century ago and the roots of universal intelligence exactly one decade ago. So it is timely to take stock of what has been achieved and what remains to be done. Since there are already good recent surveys, I describe the state-of-the-art only in passing and refer the reader to the literature. This article concentrates on the open problems in universal induction and its extension to universal intelligence.			arxiv	[]	250.0
