1	1st China Chess King Competition, featuring Ding Liren, Wei Yi, Wang Hao, Yu Yangyi	Unknown	2024-01-05 20:46:25	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18zh46m/1st_china_chess_king_competition_featuring_ding/	Current world champion Ding Liren is making an appearance, along with other Super GMs at the Rapid tournament in Chengdu, China. Model is Swiss, 8 rounds, time format 15+10. Round 1 on 2024/01/06 at 9:30 Time zone is not specified, but the Chinese stream countdown in the link below ends approx 10 hours from now, which is 8 am CET (11 pm PST, 2 am EST). Link to tournament (tournament page doesn't exist): https://chess-results.com/tnr873917.aspx?lan=1&turdet=YES Link to Chinese stream (I hope it is a stream, I used Google Translate): https://wx.vzan.com/live/page/1855545085?v=1704356671000 Is there an English-speaking chess streamer that plans to cover this tournament? I would love to watch Ding back in action after such a long hiatus, and Rapid is one of the most exciting formats out there.	15.0	t3_18zh46m	reddit

8	GM Pia Cramling is a Delightful Commentator	Unknown	2024-01-05 18:59:04	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18zeil6/gm_pia_cramling_is_a_delightful_commentator/	Over the past few weeks, I've been watching Pia's commentary of her daughter Anna's games in the Rilton ELO tournament ([VODs here](https://www.youtube.com/@AnnaCramlingExtra/videos)). Maybe this is old news, but this was my first time watching, and she's been a *spectacular* host. I don't remember the last time I've been so engaged in a chess tournament, even though I know very little about Anna. Pia is super engaged and excited, seemingly able to talk endlessly for hours on end, all while smiling. Her passion for the game is infectious and makes me want to play! Sure, part of this is probably that she's commentating games for her daughter, but she's clearly also invested for the love of chess. As for her analysis, as (EDIT for clarity: *I* am) someone who's not the greatest player, her commentary feels like the perfect level of depth for me. She doesn't dumb down her analysis - far from it - but she does take the time to explain aspects of a position that might not be so obvious to me. She goes deep into variations while still keeping tabs on overarching strategic ideas, and helps me get into the mindset of the players. Can we get her commentate some other events? I feel like she'd bring a cool perspective to other tournaments!	36.0	t3_18zeil6	reddit

10	Winning a 15|10 feels so much better than winning a blitz.	Unknown	2024-01-06 17:45:58	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1905gbu/winning_a_1510_feels_so_much_better_than_winning/	I am very new to chess and was only playing 5 minute blitz games. I would win maybe 1/10 games or so and it was frustrating me beyond belief since my blitz rating literally can‚Äôt get any lower (100 elo). I am learning the London system and studying a lot but still could not win anything. I took this subs advice and played my first slower game which was a 15|10. I ended up winning on move 38 with a Nf7#. (Game posted below if you want to check it out) I literally screamed after the game was over! Yes there were some moves I can improve on and I didn‚Äôt play perfect, but it felt way more rewarding than winning a 3 or 5 min blitz. Anyway, just thought I would share this with you guys. As a husband, father of 4, and someone who is dedicated to work, I don‚Äôt have time to participate in the local chess club, and none of my friends are into chess, so you all are the only ones who will understand and I can brag to (even though it wasn‚Äôt much). The game: 1. d4 e5 2. c3 Bd6 3. dxe5 Bxe5 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. e3 a5 6. Bd3 Qf6 7. e4 d6 8. Nbd2 Bg4 9. h3 Nh6 10. hxg4 Nxg4 11. Nc4 Nxf2 12. Kxf2 g5 13. g4 b5 14. Bxg5 Qg6 15. b4 Bxc3 16. Rc1 bxc4 17.

16	Chess-GPT, 1000x smaller than GPT-4, plays 1500 ELO chess. We can visualize its internal board state, and it accurately estimates the ELO rating of the players in a game.	Unknown	2024-01-06 17:22:32	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1904wm2/chessgpt_1000x_smaller_than_gpt4_plays_1500_elo/	"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct's ELO rating of 1800 is chess seemed magical. But it's not! A 100-1000x smaller parameter LLM given a few million games of chess will learn to play at ELO 1500. This model is only trained to predict the next character in PGN strings (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 ‚Ä¶) and is never explicitly given the state of the board or the rules of chess. Despite this, in order to better predict the next character, it learns to compute the state of the board at any point of the game, and learns a diverse set of rules, including check, checkmate, castling, en passant, promotion, pinned pieces, etc. In addition, to better predict the next character it also learns to estimate latent variables such as the ELO rating of the players in the game. &#x200B; We can visualize the internal board state of the model as it's predicting the next character. For example, in this heatmap, we have the white pawn location on the left, a binary probe output in the middle, and a gradient of probe confidence on the right. We can see the model is extremely confident that no white pawns are on either back rank. &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/0z3pvc74suac1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=54aed04c77416fa3a9384cf5ef03c61f3de2a633 I am very curious how this model learns to play well. My first idea is that it just has very good ""intuition"" about what a good move is and how to evaluate if a move is good. The second idea is that it is actually considering a range of moves, and then its opponents potential responses to those moves. Does anyone know about how well people can play purely off of intuition, without thinking about their opponent's response?

Unknown	2024-01-06 17:45:35	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1905fzz/does_practicing_chess_puzzles_actually_help/	I want to improve my game but I've been stuck at the same elo for months now. I picked up chess in 2020 around the time of the first pogchamps and all I've really done is play on [chess.com](https://chess.com/). I haven't practiced chess in any other way, not even puzzles. Despite that I've reached 1700+ elo in all formats (rapid, blitz and bullet) and peaked near 1800. Tbh I don't even play rapid, literally all I've done is grind blitz and bullet everyday (10k-15k games across all my accounts and all time controls) and my rapid naturally improved as I got better at blitz. The only openings I play are the italian, but mostly I just try to develop my pieces into the center and half the games I try to castle on the opposite side and attack. I feel like I've hit a wall and got to the point where I should practice and put in some work to see improvement. I hate doing puzzles because they are not fun to do at all. To sit there and think about the entire sequence of moves and possible enemy moves... it's just not my cup of tea. Honestly I still enjoy the game and will keep playing 3+0 even if I don't improve. I was just curious whether practicing puzzles are worthwhile if my goal is to improve my skills. Thanks.	3.0	t3_1905fzz	reddit

34	How would you rank the most prestigious chess tournaments?	 BOBBY FISCHER FANBOY	2024-01-06 11:33:30	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18zy50b/how_would_you_rank_the_most_prestigious_chess/	"Since most of the chess world cannot really decide on what the most prestigious active chess events really are (I use the adjective ""active"" to distinguish from discontinued/defunct chess events such as the Zonals/Interzonals, Linares, Dortmund, etc.), I thought it would be interesting to hold a discussion on the same topic. My personal (super subjective) top ten list would go something like: 1.) The World Chess Championship (cuz like 95% of the time it's a contest between the strongest and second strongest player in the world) 2.) The Candidates Tournament (second to the World Championship because it's the only tournament where the world champion isn't allowed to play, but most of the strongest players in the world are) 3.) The FIDE World Cup (path to most candidates events) 4.) The Grand Swiss (same as the CWC, path to most candidates events) 5.) The Grand Prix (feels like a less flashy version of the two tournaments above) 6.) Wijk aan Zee (I place it this high because of the historical context... literally every world champion since Botvinnik has participated in at least one Wijk aan Zee before (except the elusive Bobby Fischer), and, as Bent Larsen himself said, ""Normal people have to see Naples before they die... but a chess grandmaster has to win Wijk aan Zee first."") 7.) Fischer Random World Championship (here I'm just repping Fischer and Carlsen's takes of enjoying intuitive chess over prep and engine memorization) 8.) The Chess Olympiad (it's a team tournament so kinda hard to fit it in here, but I think #8 is its rightful spot) 9.) The Sinquefield Cup (they have often had incredibly strong tournaments, sometimes with all the top players attending, starting from #1) 10.) World Rapid/Blitz Championships (the funnest ones to watch, but not necessarily the most prestigious/coveted... still pretty important tho) Honourable mentions would be the GCT (multiple tournaments), Tal Memorial, Capablanca Memorial, SCC (held by [chess.com](https://chess.com)) and Norway Chess.

A good tactics/puzzle book for someone my level. I have 1001 Chess Tactics from Games of Every Day Players by Brennan and Carson which I felt was too easy, 1001 Chess Exercises for Club Players by Erwich was too difficult (can get maybe 20% of the puzzles right). 2. A good resource for openings? I know this isn't the most important thing but I feel like learning the principles behind the opening, what you're trying to achieve, and where you want the pieces to end up would help my positional playing. I've tried some chessable courses on the Ruy Lopez but they all focus on clusters of sidelines off of one main line which isn't really necessary for a low intermediate player like me.	1.0	t3_1903x6j	reddit

43	Chess Rules Need To Change: My Thesis and Follow Up to My Previous Post	Unknown	2024-01-06 18:11:37	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/19062it/chess_rules_need_to_change_my_thesis_and_follow/	"So I made a post today and I don't think anyone actually read my comments in there, and are just repeating the same thing over and over while failing to see the question from my angle. Not helpful. For that reason I am getting rid of the image of the hypothetical position to help you to read my thoughts. So let me try to explain better: Part 1: Ok. First, I want you to drop everything you know about the rules and think about this conceptually. Approach this as if you are making the rules, imagine you are developing the game and need to create these rules. First guiding questions: **1. What is check?** Check is when your king is in danger of being captured on the next move. Can we agree to this? **2. Absolute pins** Black cannot move his rook due to the absolute pin, this would be an illegal move. Right? Can we all agree that the rules say you cannot move a piece if that means your king is put in check. Moving a piece out of an absolute pin is not allowed. Ok now that we have established black cannot move his rook because that would be an illegal move, does that mean my king is in check? Or in other words, if the move that captures my king is illegal and cannot be played, does that mean my king is in danger? I say no under the rules of chess that we have today. Since black cannot legally move his rook on the next move, that means my king is not in danger of being captured on the next move. Therefore, my king is not in check. I encourage you to take a minute and think about that. I feel like people just looked at the picture and went ""yes"" because they think of how the rules are and now how they are conceptually. And I agree, as the rules are now, my king is in check, but it does not make sense is the point I am making. **Another way of putting it:**If the move that would capture your king is an illegal move that cannot be played, is your king actually in check? It is paradoxical, because the move that that makes you king in danger is illegal and cannot be played, but you're in check because your king could be captured...but it cant be captured because the piece cant move to capture your king. It makes no sense to me. Now part 2 of my post and why I think the rules need to change: I think in chess you should be able to ignore checks and capture kings as a means to end the game. Obviously if you ignore check then you lose on the next move. Why? Because it fixes this paradox. If black could ignore an absolute pin then yes, my king is in danger. But as the rules stands right now, if black were to move his rook to capture my king...well that is illegal since he put his own king in check. For this reason I think we need to reevaluate the rules to allow king captures and the ability to ignore checks. Under that circumstance, then yes, my king is actually in danger of being captured. Ok now that you‚Äôve read the point I‚Äôm trying to make, [here](https://imgur.com/a/5HoFmuo) is the image of the hypothetical position I am referring to. Now obviously white just captures the rook with check and it‚Äôs a draw. But think what would happen if that bishop was doing something else too at the time and it wouldn‚Äôt be beneficial to capture the rook. Again this is hypothetical, and this position is simplified down to illustrate my point."	3.0	t3_19062it	reddit

47	Can the game of chess have similarities to overtraining in physical exercise, if done too often? I felt mentally exhausted a while back.	Unknown	2024-01-06 08:06:53	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18zv41h/can_the_game_of_chess_have_similarities_to/	I've noticed if I play chess really often i.e. 8-12 games a day on chess.com for weeks on end or more, I burn out. I recently went on a 189 day streak and then I started losing and losing badly. I did really well in the beginning, mellowed out and stagnated in the middle, then plummeted. After not playing for a month because I got fed up with it, I came back and played a game. Then the winning streaks returned and I went up to 1300 when I ended at like 1050 (I lost a lot of games...). This reminds me of overtraining in sports. I can't run long distances 7 days a week as that will prevent healing from injuries and allowing the body time to rest and build muscle. I can't benchpress everyday because that'll just lead to torn muscles, injuries, and a sharp decline in strength. Could the sme be told for chess or did I just hit a skill wall in the match making?

Unknown	2024-01-06 09:31:59	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18zwd1v/chess_puzzle_for_scavenger_hunt_does_it_make_sense/	Dear chess community, I need your help. I want to create a puzzle for my chess-loving friend but I've never played chess. ChatGPT has helped me, can you check if the puzzle makes sense? (Please don't care about language, it will be in another language anyway.) Also, how could I get a 4-digit-code in the end? A king ruled over the magical land of [city] whose destiny was determined by the pieces on an ancient chessboard. His queen, a noble and wise woman, proudly sat by his side. However, the kingdom was in danger, and the king called his loyal horse-riding knights to gather and protect the land. The knights, with their shiny armor, stood ready to fend off attacks from enemy pieces. Yet, tall towers, proud and majestic, formed the defensive line. Only with the correct positioning of the soldiers could the kingdom be saved. The story contains the keys to position the chess pieces on the board. Pay attention to the hierarchy and roles of the pieces to discover the magical pattern that opens the doors to the next puzzle. Solution: The king ruled over the land - Place the white king on the square e1. The queen, a noble and wise woman, proudly sat by his side - Place the white queen on the square d1. The loyal knights on horseback - Place the white knights on squares b1 and g1. Tall towers, proud and majestic, formed the defensive line - Place the white rooks on squares a1 and h1. The soldiers, ready to fend off attacks from enemy pieces - Place the white pawns on squares a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2.	2.0	t3_18zwd1v	reddit

79	Are people developing deeper theory for moves like 1a/h4/3, or ..a/h5/6, due to Magnus and Hikaru?	~1300 FIDE	2024-01-04 20:56:13	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18ynp1f/are_people_developing_deeper_theory_for_moves/	"When Magnus and Hikaru play online blitz, they often like to play ""ridiculous"" first moves, such as starting with a flank pawn push (a or h, 3, 4, 5, or 6). Often this pays off greatly for them, likely because their opponents don't know the proper moves. I've thus been wondering if the titled Tuesday champions playing like this, has led to someone developing serious theory for these flank pawn pushes? My instinct would be to play principaled in these situations, but with engine analysis there could be better ways to ask the questionable moves what their purposes are. Historically I guess that these moves have not seen much theory, since noone would deign to play them, but most GMs can be fairly certain to see one of these four moves when meeting the top players online, and I guess that would be enough to warrant some theory for the master players? I don't think I've ever seen an opening book or course on these moves, so does anyone know if that has been created recently? I'm not necessarily interested in playing these moves, but if is an area with highly underdeveloped theory, it seems like the perfect place for Carlsen and Hikaru to get openings named after themselves?"	13.0	t3_18ynp1f	reddit

101	On the Impact of Information Technologies on Society: an Historical Perspective through the Game of Chess	Frederic Prost	2012-03-15 18:17:04	http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3434v1	The game of chess as always been viewed as an iconic representation of intellectual prowess. Since the very beginning of computer science, the challenge of being able to program a computer capable of playing chess and beating humans has been alive and used both as a mark to measure hardware/software progresses and as an ongoing programming challenge leading to numerous discoveries. In the early days of computer science it was a topic for specialists. But as computers were democratized, and the strength of chess engines began to increase, chess players started to appropriate to themselves these new tools. We show how these interactions between the world of chess and information technologies have been herald of broader social impacts of information technologies. The game of chess, and more broadly the world of chess (chess players, literature, computer softwares and websites dedicated to chess, etc.), turns out to be a surprisingly and particularly sharp indicator of the changes induced in our everyday life by the information technologies. Moreover, in the same way that chess is a modelization of war that captures the raw features of strategic thinking, chess world can be seen as small society making the study of the information technologies impact easier to analyze and to grasp.			arxiv	[]	1.0

By jointly training the neural chess engine and the generation models for different categories, the models become more effective.

The only difference with respect to the classical variant of Chess-game is that each rook after its having been captured by enemy chess piece in the proccess of gaming is not to be eliminated from the current game, but this rook is assumed being under virtual repairing during next N-steps (the required number of N is discussed in the current research). Then afterwards, such rook will be introduced in game again during maximal N-steps if only the chessboard square (on which it was captured previously) has not been occupied at previous step. In this case, Phoenix-Chess can be classified as game without predictable horizon of planning, so this kind of game should be considered as Chess-like games with incomplete information.			arxiv	['Millana Ershkova']	4.0

This function is pre-trained on the sentiment of commentary associated with the training moves and is used to guide and optimize the agent's game-playing decision making. The contributions of this research are three-fold: we build and put forward both a classifier which extracts commentary describing the quality of Chess moves in vast commentary datasets, and a Sentiment Analysis model trained on Chess commentary to accurately predict the quality of said moves, to then use those predictions to evaluate the optimal next move of a Chess agent. Both classifiers achieve over 90 % classification accuracy. Lastly, we present a Chess engine, SentiMATE, which evaluates Chess moves based on a pre-trained sentiment evaluation function. Our results exhibit strong evidence to support our initial hypothesis - ""Can Natural Language Processing be used to train a novel and sample efficient evaluation function in Chess Engines?"" - as we integrate our evaluation function into modern Chess engines and play against agents with traditional Chess move evaluation functions, beating both random agents and a DeepChess implementation at a level-one search depth - representing the number of moves a traditional Chess agent (employing the alpha-beta search algorithm) looks ahead in order to evaluate a given chess state."			arxiv	['Isaac Bentata Chocron', 'Nicholas McCarthy']	6.0

State-of-the-art engines now provide an authoritative judgement that can be used in many applications like cheating detection, intrinsic ratings computation, skill assessment, or the study of human decision-making. A key issue for the research community is to gather a large dataset of chess games together with the judgement of chess engines. Unfortunately the analysis of each move takes lots of times. In this paper, we report our effort to analyse almost 5 millions chess games with a computing grid. During summer 2015, we processed 270 millions unique played positions using the Stockfish engine with a quite high depth (20). We populated a database of 1+ tera-octets of chess evaluations, representing an estimated time of 50 years of computation on a single machine. Our effort is a first step towards the replication of research results, the supply of open data and procedures for exploring new directions, and the investigation of software engineering/scalability issues when computing billions of moves.			arxiv	['Fran√ßois Esnault']	8.0

It requires entry of moves into a chess engine which is, cumbersome and error prone. We present ARChessAnalyzer, a complete pipeline from live image capture of a physical chess game, to board and piece recognition, to move analysis and finally to Augmented Reality (AR) overlay of the chess diagram position and move on the physical board. ARChessAnalyzer is like a scene analyzer - it uses an ensemble of traditional image and vision techniques to segment the scene (ie the chess game) and uses Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict the segmented pieces and combine it together to analyze the game. This paper advances the state of the art in the first of its kind end to end integration of robust detection and segmentation of the board, chess piece detection using the fine-tuned AlexNet CNN and chess engine analyzer in a handheld device app. The accuracy of the entire chess position prediction pipeline is 93.45\% and takes 3-4.5sec from live capture to AR overlay. We also validated our hypothesis that ARChessAnalyzer, is faster at analysis than manual entry for all board positions for valid outcomes. Our hope is that the instantaneous feedback this app provides will help chess learners worldwide at all levels improve their game.			arxiv	[]	9.0
110	Learning to Play Chess from Textbooks (LEAP): a Corpus for Evaluating Chess Moves based on Sentiment Analysis	Haifa Alrdahi	2023-10-31 08:26:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20260v1	Learning chess strategies has been investigated widely, with most studies focussing on learning from previous games using search algorithms. Chess textbooks encapsulate grandmaster knowledge, explain playing strategies and require a smaller search space compared to traditional chess agents. This paper examines chess textbooks as a new knowledge source for enabling machines to learn how to play chess -- a resource that has not been explored previously. We developed the LEAP corpus, a first and new heterogeneous dataset with structured (chess move notations and board states) and unstructured data (textual descriptions) collected from a chess textbook containing 1164 sentences discussing strategic moves from 91 games. We firstly labelled the sentences based on their relevance, i.e., whether they are discussing a move. Each relevant sentence was then labelled according to its sentiment towards the described move. We performed empirical experiments that assess the performance of various transformer-based baseline models for sentiment analysis. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of employing transformer-based sentiment analysis models for evaluating chess moves, with the best performing model obtaining a weighted micro F_1 score of 68%. Finally, we synthesised the LEAP corpus to create a larger dataset, which can be used as a solution to the limited textual resource in the chess domain.			arxiv	['Riza Batista-Navarro']	10.0

Evans	2013-02-18 18:14:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4377v2	We investigate the transfinite game values arising in infinite chess, providing both upper and lower bounds on the supremum of these values---the omega one of chess---with two senses depending on whether one considers only finite positions or also positions with infinitely many pieces. For lower bounds, we present specific infinite positions with transfinite game values of omega, omega^2, omega^2 times k, and omega^3. By embedding trees into chess, we show that there is a computable infinite chess position that is a win for white if the players are required to play according to a deterministic computable strategy, but which is a draw without that restriction. Finally, we prove that every countable ordinal arises as the game value of a position in infinite three-dimensional chess, and consequently the omega one of infinite three-dimensional chess is as large as it can be, namely, true omega one.			arxiv	['Joel David Hamkins']	12.0

Opening Theory is one of the pillars of chess and requires years of study to be mastered. Here we exploit the ""wisdom of the crowd"" in an online chess platform to answer questions that, traditionally, only chess experts could tackle. We first define the relatedness network of chess openings that quantifies how similar two openings are to play. In this network, we spot communities of nodes corresponding to the most common opening choices and their mutual relationships, information which is hard to obtain from the existing classification of openings. Moreover, we use the relatedness network to forecast the future openings players will start to play and we back-test these predictions, obtaining performances considerably higher than those of a random predictor. Finally, we use the Economic Fitness and Complexity algorithm to measure how difficult to play openings are and how skilled in openings players are. This study not only gives a new perspective on chess analysis but also opens the possibility of suggesting personalized opening recommendations using complex network theory."			arxiv	['Vito DP Servedio']	13.0
113	Chess Pure Strategies are Probably Chaotic	M. Chaves	1998-08-21 19:13:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9808001v1	It is odd that chess grandmasters often disagree in their analysis of positions, sometimes even of simple ones, and that a grandmaster can hold his own against an powerful analytic machine such as Deep Blue. The fact that there must exist pure winning strategies for chess is used to construct a control strategy function. It is then shown that chess strategy is equivalent to an autonomous system of differential equations, and conjectured that the system is chaotic. If true the conjecture would explain the forenamed peculiarities and would also imply that there cannot exist a static evaluator for chess.			arxiv	[]	14.0

In this paper the `Chess-board Extraction by Subtraction and Summation' (ChESS) feature detector, designed to exclusively respond to chess-board vertices, is presented. The method proposed is robust against noise, poor lighting and poor contrast, requires no prior knowledge of the extent of the chess-board pattern, is computationally very efficient, and provides a strength measure of detected features. Such a detector has significant application both in the key field of camera calibration, as well as in Structured Light 3D reconstruction. Evidence is presented showing its robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in comparison to other commonly used detectors both under simulation and in experimental 3D reconstruction of flat plate and cylindrical objects			arxiv	['Joan Lasenby']	16.0
116	Innovation and Nested Preferential Growth in Chess Playing Behavior	Juan I. Perotti	2013-09-02 09:29:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0336v2	Complexity develops via the incorporation of innovative properties. Chess is one of the most complex strategy games, where expert contenders exercise decision making by imitating old games or introducing innovations. In this work, we study innovation in chess by analyzing how different move sequences are played at the population level. It is found that the probability of exploring a new or innovative move decreases as a power law with the frequency of the preceding move sequence. Chess players also exploit already known move sequences according to their frequencies, following a preferential growth mechanism. Furthermore, innovation in chess exhibits Heaps' law suggesting similarities with the process of vocabulary growth. We propose a robust generative mechanism based on nested Yule-Simon preferential growth processes that reproduces the empirical observations. These results, supporting the self-similar nature of innovations in chess are important in the context of decision making in a competitive scenario, and extend the scope of relevant findings recently discovered regarding the emergence of Zipf's law in chess.			arxiv	['Hang-Hyun Jo', 'Ana L.

Without any a priori knowledge, in particular without any knowledge regarding the rules of chess, a deep neural network is trained using a combination of unsupervised pretraining and supervised training. The unsupervised training extracts high level features from a given position, and the supervised training learns to compare two chess positions and select the more favorable one. The training relies entirely on datasets of several million chess games, and no further domain specific knowledge is incorporated. The experiments show that the resulting neural network (referred to as DeepChess) is on a par with state-of-the-art chess playing programs, which have been developed through many years of manual feature selection and tuning. DeepChess is the first end-to-end machine learning-based method that results in a grandmaster-level chess playing performance.			arxiv	['Nathan S. Netanyahu', 'Lior Wolf']	18.0

This work presents the re-implementation of the concept detection methodology applied to AlphaZero in McGrath et al. (2022), by using large, open-source chess models with comparable performance. We obtain results similar to those achieved on AlphaZero, while relying solely on open-source resources. We also present a novel explainable AI (XAI) method, which is guaranteed to highlight exhaustively and exclusively the information used by the explained model. This method generates visual explanations tailored to domains characterised by discrete input spaces, as is the case for chess. Our presented method has the desirable property of controlling the information flow between any input vector and the given model, which in turn provides strict guarantees regarding what information is used by the trained model during inference. We demonstrate the viability of our method by applying it to standard 8x8 chess, using large open-source chess models.			arxiv	['Inga Str√ºmke']	19.0

Current approaches use a pipeline of separate, independent, modules such as chessboard detection, square localization, and piece classification. Instead, we follow the deep learning philosophy and explore an end-to-end approach to directly predict the configuration from the image, thus avoiding the error accumulation of the sequential approaches and eliminating the need for intermediate annotations. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset, Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), that consists of 10,800 real photographs and their corresponding annotations. In contrast to existing datasets that are synthetically rendered and have only limited angles, ChessReD has photographs captured from various angles using smartphone cameras; a sensor choice made to ensure real-world applicability. Our approach in chess recognition on the introduced challenging benchmark dataset outperforms related approaches, successfully recognizing the chess pieces' configuration in 15.26% of ChessReD's test images. This accuracy may seem low, but it is ~7x better than the current state-of-the-art and reflects the difficulty of the problem. The code and data are available through: https://github.com/ThanosM97/end-to-end-chess-recognition.			arxiv	['Jan van Gemert']	20.0
120	Assessing Game Balance with AlphaZero: Exploring Alternative Rule Sets in Chess	Nenad Toma≈°ev	2020-09-09 15:49:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04374v2	It is non-trivial to design engaging and balanced sets of game rules. Modern chess has evolved over centuries, but without a similar recourse to history, the consequences of rule changes to game dynamics are difficult to predict. AlphaZero provides an alternative in silico means of game balance assessment. It is a system that can learn near-optimal strategies for any rule set from scratch, without any human supervision, by continually learning from its own experience. In this study we use AlphaZero to creatively explore and design new chess variants. There is growing interest in chess variants like Fischer Random Chess, because of classical chess's voluminous opening theory, the high percentage of draws in professional play, and the non-negligible number of games that end while both players are still in their home preparation. We compare nine other variants that involve atomic changes to the rules of chess. The changes allow for novel strategic and tactical patterns to emerge, while keeping the games close to the original. By learning near-optimal strategies for each variant with AlphaZero, we determine what games between strong human players might look like if these variants were adopted. Qualitatively, several variants are very dynamic. An analytic comparison show that pieces are valued differently between variants, and that some variants are more decisive than classical chess. Our findings demonstrate the rich possibilities that lie beyond the rules of modern chess.			arxiv	['Ulrich Paquet', 'Demis Hassabis', 'Vladimir Kramnik']	21.0

Generalizing a known result on so-called Richman games, we show that for a natural class of games including bidding chess, each position can be assigned rational upper and lower values corresponding to the limit proportion of money that Black (say) needs in order to force a win and to avoid losing, respectively. We have computed these values for all three-piece endgames, and in all cases, the upper and lower values coincide. Already with three pieces, the game is quite complex, and the values have denominators of up to 138 digits.			arxiv	['Johan W√§stlund']	30.0

The reflexmate is a derivative of the selfmate in which White compels Black to checkmate with the added condition that if either player can checkmate, they must do that (when this condition applies only to Black, it is a semi-reflexmate). We slightly modify the reduction of EXPTIME-hardness of Chess and apply the reduction to these Chess problems. It is proved that selfmate, reflexmate, and semi-reflexmate are all EXPTIME-complete.			arxiv	[]	32.0

However, the rules for playing it are rather complex since there are different types of pieces and the ways they are allowed to move depend upon the type of the piece. In this paper we discuss alternative paradigms that can be used for modelling the rule of the chess game using VDM++ and show what we believe is the best model. It is also illustrated how this model can be connected to a standard textual notation for the moves in a chess game. This can be used to combine the formal model to a more convenient interface.			arxiv	['Peter Gorm Larsen']	33.0
132	The Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate: A New Approach to Computational Creativity	Azlan Iqbal	2015-07-25 03:00:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07058v2	We introduce a new artificial intelligence (AI) approach called, the 'Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate' (DSNS). It uses selected attributes from objects in various domains (e.g. chess problems, classical music, renowned artworks) and recombines them in such a way as to generate new attributes that can then, in principle, be used to create novel objects of creative value to humans relating to any one of the source domains. This allows some of the burden of creative content generation to be passed from humans to machines. The approach was tested in the domain of chess problem composition. We used it to automatically compose numerous sets of chess problems based on attributes extracted and recombined from chess problems and tournament games by humans, renowned paintings, computer-evolved abstract art, photographs of people, and classical music tracks. The quality of these generated chess problems was then assessed automatically using an existing and experimentally-validated computational chess aesthetics model. They were also assessed by human experts in the domain. The results suggest that attributes collected and recombined from chess and other domains using the DSNS approach can indeed be used to automatically generate chess problems of reasonably high aesthetic quality. In particular, a low quality chess source (i.e. tournament game sequences between weak players) used in combination with actual photographs of people was able to produce three-move chess problems of comparable quality or better to those generated using a high quality chess source (i.e. published compositions by human experts), and more efficiently as well. Why information from a foreign domain can be integrated and functional in this way remains an open question for now. The DSNS approach is, in principle, scalable and applicable to any domain in which objects have attributes that can be represented using real numbers.			arxiv	['Matej Guid', 'Simon Colton', 'Jana Krivec', 'Shazril Azman', 'Boshra Haghighi']	34.0

The visual attention model described in this article has been created to generate saliency maps that capture hierarchical and spatial features of chessboard, in order to predict the probability fixation for individual pixels Using a skip-layer architecture of an autoencoder, with a unified decoder, we are able to use multiscale features to predict saliency of part of the board at different scales, showing multiple relations between pieces. We have used scan path and fixation data from players engaged in solving chess problems, to compute 6600 saliency maps associated to the corresponding chess piece configurations. This corpus is completed with synthetically generated data from actual games gathered from an online chess platform. Experiments realized using both scan-paths from chess players and the CAT2000 saliency dataset of natural images, highlights several results. Deep features, pretrained on natural images, were found to be helpful in training visual attention prediction for chess. The proposed neural network architecture is able to generate meaningful saliency maps on unseen chess configurations with good scores on standard metrics. This work provides a baseline for future work on visual attention prediction in similar contexts.			arxiv	['Thomas Guntz', 'James Crowley', 'Dominique Vaufreydaz']	35.0

135	Comparing Typical Opening Move Choices Made by Humans and Chess Engines	Mark Levene	2006-10-11 10:26:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0610060v1	The opening book is an important component of a chess engine, and thus computer chess programmers have been developing automated methods to improve the quality of their books. For chess, which has a very rich opening theory, large databases of high-quality games can be used as the basis of an opening book, from which statistics relating to move choices from given positions can be collected. In order to find out whether the opening books used by modern chess engines in machine versus machine competitions are ``comparable'' to those used by chess players in human versus human competitions, we carried out analysis on 26 test positions using statistics from two opening books one compiled from humans' games and the other from machines' games. Our analysis using several nonparametric measures, shows that, overall, there is a strong association between humans' and machines' choices of opening moves when using a book to guide their choices.			arxiv	['Judit Bar-Ilan']	37.0

Unlike previous attempts using machine learning only to perform parameter-tuning on hand-crafted evaluation functions, Giraffe's learning system also performs automatic feature extraction and pattern recognition. The trained evaluation function performs comparably to the evaluation functions of state-of-the-art chess engines - all of which containing thousands of lines of carefully hand-crafted pattern recognizers, tuned over many years by both computer chess experts and human chess masters. Giraffe is the most successful attempt thus far at using end-to-end machine learning to play chess.			arxiv	[]	39.0
138	Complexity of Retrograde and Helpmate Chess Problems: Even Cooperative Chess is Hard	Josh Brunner	2020-10-19 07:32:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09271v1	"We prove PSPACE-completeness of two classic types of Chess problems when generalized to n-by-n boards. A ""retrograde"" problem asks whether it is possible for a position to be reached from a natural starting position, i.e., whether the position is ""valid"" or ""legal"" or ""reachable"". Most real-world retrograde Chess problems ask for the last few moves of such a sequence; we analyze the decision question which gets at the existence of an exponentially long move sequence. A ""helpmate"" problem asks whether it is possible for a player to become checkmated by any sequence of moves from a given position. A helpmate problem is essentially a cooperative form of Chess, where both players work together to cause a particular player to win; it also arises in regular Chess games, where a player who runs out of time (flags) loses only if they could ever possibly be checkmated from the current position (i.e., the helpmate problem has a solution). Our PSPACE-hardness reductions are from a variant of a puzzle game called Subway Shuffle."			arxiv	['Erik D. Demaine', 'Dylan Hendrickson', 'Julian Wellman']	40.0
139	Intransitively winning chess players positions	Alexander Poddiakov	2022-12-11 05:55:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11069v1	Positions of chess players in intransitive (rock-paper-scissors) relations are considered. Namely, position A of White is preferable (it should be chosen if choice is possible) to position B of Black, position B of Black is preferable to position C of White, position C of White is preferable to position D of Black, but position D of Black is preferable to position A of White. Intransitivity of winningness of positions of chess players is considered to be a consequence of complexity of the chess environment -- in contrast with simpler games with transitive positions only. The space of relations between winningness of positions of chess players is non-Euclidean. The Zermelo-von Neumann theorem is complemented by statements about possibility vs. impossibility of building pure winning strategies based on the assumption of transitivity of positions of chess players. Questions about the possibility of intransitive positions of players in other positional games are raised.			arxiv	[]	41.0
140	The mate-in-n problem of infinite chess is decidable	Dan Brumleve	2012-01-26 18:26:57	http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5597v4	Infinite chess is chess played on an infinite edgeless chessboard. The familiar chess pieces move about according to their usual chess rules, and each player strives to place the opposing king into checkmate. The mate-in-n problem of infinite chess is the problem of determining whether a designated player can force a win from a given finite position in at most n moves. A naive formulation of this problem leads to assertions of high arithmetic complexity with 2n alternating quantifiers---there is a move for white, such that for every black reply, there is a counter-move for white, and so on. In such a formulation, the problem does not appear to be decidable; and one cannot expect to search an infinitely branching game tree even to finite depth. Nevertheless, the main theorem of this article, confirming a conjecture of the first author and C. D. A. Evans, establishes that the mate-in-n problem of infinite chess is computably decidable, uniformly in the position and in n. Furthermore, there is a computable strategy for optimal play from such mate-in-n positions. The proof proceeds by showing that the mate-in-n problem is expressible in what we call the first-order structure of chess, which we prove (in the relevant fragment) is an automatic structure, whose theory is therefore decidable. Indeed, it is definable in Presburger arithmetic. Unfortunately, this resolution of the mate-in-n problem does not appear to settle the decidability of the more general winning-position problem, the problem of determining whether a designated player has a winning strategy from a given position, since a position may admit a winning strategy without any bound on the number of moves required. This issue is connected with transfinite game values in infinite chess, and the exact value of the omega one of chess is not known.			arxiv	['Joel David Hamkins', 'Philipp Schlicht']	42.0
141	Measuring the Non-Transitivity in Chess	Ricky Sanjaya	2021-10-22 12:15:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11737v1	It has long been believed that Chess is the \emph{Drosophila} of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Studying Chess can productively provide valid knowledge about complex systems. Although remarkable progress has been made on solving Chess, the geometrical landscape of Chess in the strategy space is still mysterious. Judging on AI-generated strategies, researchers hypothesised that the strategy space of Chess possesses a spinning top geometry, with the upright axis representing the \emph{transitive} dimension (e.g., A beats B, B beats C, A beats C), and the radial axis representing the \emph{non-transitive} dimension (e.g., A beats B, B beats C, C beats A). However, it is unclear whether such a hypothesis holds for real-world strategies. In this paper, we quantify the non-transitivity in Chess through real-world data from human players. Specifically, we performed two ways of non-transitivity quantifications -- Nash Clustering and counting the number of Rock-Paper-Scissor cycles -- on over one billion match data from Lichess and FICS. Our findings positively indicate that the strategy space occupied by real-world Chess strategies demonstrates a spinning top geometry, and more importantly, there exists a strong connection between the degree of non-transitivity and the progression of a Chess player's rating. In particular, high degrees of non-transitivity tend to prevent human players from making progress on their Elo rating, whereas progressions are easier to make at the level of ratings where the degree of non-transitivity is lower. Additionally, we also investigate the implication of the degree of non-transitivity for population-based training methods. By considering \emph{fixed-memory Fictitious Play} as a proxy, we reach the conclusion that maintaining large-size and diverse populations of strategies is imperative to training effective AI agents in solving Chess types of games.			arxiv	['Jun Wang', 'Yaodong Yang']	43.0
142	Determining Chess Game State From an Image	Georg W√∂lflein	2021-04-30 13:02:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14963v2	Identifying the configuration of chess pieces from an image of a chessboard is a problem in computer vision that has not yet been solved accurately. However, it is important for helping amateur chess players improve their games by facilitating automatic computer analysis without the overhead of manually entering the pieces. Current approaches are limited by the lack of large datasets and are not designed to adapt to unseen chess sets. This paper puts forth a new dataset synthesised from a 3D model that is an order of magnitude larger than existing ones. Trained on this dataset, a novel end-to-end chess recognition system is presented that combines traditional computer vision techniques with deep learning. It localises the chessboard using a RANSAC-based algorithm that computes a projective transformation of the board onto a regular grid. Using two convolutional neural networks, it then predicts an occupancy mask for the squares in the warped image and finally classifies the pieces. The described system achieves an error rate of 0.23% per square on the test set, 28 times better than the current state of the art. Further, a few-shot transfer learning approach is developed that is able to adapt the inference system to a previously unseen chess set using just two photos of the starting position, obtaining a per-square accuracy of 99.83% on images of that new chess set. The code, dataset, and trained models are made available online.			arxiv	['Ognjen Arandjeloviƒá']	44.0
143	Fairer Chess: A Reversal of Two Opening Moves in Chess Creates Balance Between White and Black	Steven J. Brams	2021-08-05 12:14:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02547v2	Unlike tic-tac-toe or checkers, in which optimal play leads to a draw, it is not known whether optimal play in chess ends in a win for White, a win for Black, or a draw. But after White moves first in chess, if Black has a double move followed by a double move of White and then alternating play, play is more balanced because White does not always tie or lead in moves. Symbolically, Balanced Alternation gives the following move sequence: After White's (W) initial move, first Black (B) and then White each have two moves in a row (BBWW), followed by the alternating sequence, beginning with W, which altogether can be written as WB/BW/WB/WB/WB... (the slashes separate alternating pairs of moves). Except for reversal of the 3rd and 4th moves from WB to BW, this is the standard chess sequence. Because Balanced Alternation lies between the standard sequence, which favors White, and a comparable sequence that favors Black, it is highly likely to produce a draw with optimal play, rendering chess fairer. This conclusion is supported by a computer analysis of chess openings and how they would play out under Balanced Alternation.			arxiv	['Mehmet S. Ismail']	45.0

This book gives a complete introduction into the technical inner workings of such engines. The book is split into four main chapters -- excluding chapter 1 (introduction) and chapter 6 (conclusion): Chapter 2 introduces neural networks and covers all the basic building blocks that are used to build deep networks such as those used by AlphaZero. Contents include the perceptron, back-propagation and gradient descent, classification, regression, multilayer perceptron, vectorization techniques, convolutional networks, squeeze and excitation networks, fully connected networks, batch normalization and rectified linear units, residual layers, overfitting and underfitting. Chapter 3 introduces classical search techniques used for chess engines as well as those used by AlphaZero. Contents include minimax, alpha-beta search, and Monte Carlo tree search. Chapter 4 shows how modern chess engines are designed. Aside from the ground-breaking AlphaGo, AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero we cover Leela Chess Zero, Fat Fritz, Fat Fritz 2 and Efficiently Updatable Neural Networks (NNUE) as well as Maia. Chapter 5 is about implementing a miniaturized AlphaZero. Hexapawn, a minimalistic version of chess, is used as an example for that. Hexapawn is solved by minimax search and training positions for supervised learning are generated. Then as a comparison, an AlphaZero-like training loop is implemented where training is done via self-play combined with reinforcement learning. Finally, AlphaZero-like training and supervised training are compared.			arxiv	[]	46.0
145	A New Approach to Draw Detection by Move Repetition in Computer Chess Programming	Vladan Vuckovic	2004-06-21 13:42:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0406038v1	We will try to tackle both the theoretical and practical aspects of a very important problem in chess programming as stated in the title of this article - the issue of draw detection by move repetition. The standard approach that has so far been employed in most chess programs is based on utilising positional matrices in original and compressed format as well as on the implementation of the so-called bitboard format. The new approach that we will be trying to introduce is based on using variant strings generated by the search algorithm (searcher) during the tree expansion in decision making. We hope to prove that this approach is more efficient than the standard treatment of the issue, especially in positions with few pieces (endgames). To illustrate what we have in mind a machine language routine that implements our theoretical assumptions is attached. The routine is part of the Axon chess program, developed by the authors. Axon, in its current incarnation, plays chess at master strength (ca. 2400-2450 Elo, based on both Axon vs computer programs and Axon vs human masters in over 3000 games altogether).			arxiv	['Djordje Vidanovic']	47.0
146	New directions in enumerative chess problems	Noam D. Elkies	2005-08-31 15:31:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0508645v1	Normally a chess problem must have a unique solution, and is deemed unsound even if there are alternatives that differ only in the order in which the same moves are played. In an enumerative chess problem, the set of moves in the solution is (usually) unique but the order is not, and the task is to count the feasible permutations via an isomorphic problem in enumerative combinatorics. Almost all enumerative chess problems have been ``series-movers'', in which one side plays an uninterrupted series of moves, unanswered except possibly for one move by the opponent at the end. This can be convenient for setting up enumeration problems, but we show that other problem genres also lend themselves to composing enumerative problems. Some of the resulting enumerations cannot be shown (or have not yet been shown) in series-movers. This article is based on a presentation given at the banquet in honor of Richard Stanley's 60th birthday, and is dedicated to Stanley on this occasion.			arxiv	[]	48.0
147	Chess, Chance and Conspiracy	Mark R. Segal	2007-08-29 14:06:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.3961v1	Chess and chance are seemingly strange bedfellows. Luck and/or randomness have no apparent role in move selection when the game is played at the highest levels. However, when competition is at the ultimate level, that of the World Chess Championship (WCC), chess and conspiracy are not strange bedfellows, there being a long and colorful history of accusations levied between participants. One such accusation, frequently repeated, was that all the games in the 1985 WCC (Karpov vs Kasparov) were fixed and prearranged move by move. That this claim was advanced by a former World Champion, Bobby Fischer, argues that it ought be investigated. That the only published, concrete basis for this claim consists of an observed run of particular moves, allows this investigation to be performed using probabilistic and statistical methods. In particular, we employ imbedded finite Markov chains to evaluate run statistic distributions. Further, we demonstrate how both chess computers and game data bases can be brought to bear on the problem.			arxiv	[]	49.0

Playing chess is one such task. It was one of the first games which was `solved' using AI. With the advent of deep learning, chess playing agents can surpass human ability with relative ease. However algorithms using deep learning must learn millions of parameters. This work looks at the game of chess through the lens of genetic algorithms. We train a genetic player from scratch using only a handful of learnable parameters. We use Multi-Niche Crowding to optimize positional Value Tables (PVTs) which are used extensively in chess engines to evaluate the goodness of a position.

The library is based on a flexible and efficient expansion in terms of Chebyshev polynomials and presently features the calculation of the density matrix, the calculation of matrix powers for arbitrary powers, and the extraction of eigenvalues in a selected interval. CheSS is able to exploit the sparsity of the matrices and scales linearly with respect to the number of nonzero entries, making it well-suited for large-scale calculations. The approach is particularly adapted for setups leading to small spectral widths of the involved matrices and outperforms alternative methods in this regime. By coupling CheSS to the DFT code BigDFT, we show that such a favorable setup is indeed possible in practice. In addition, the approach based on Chebyshev polynomials can be massively parallelized, and CheSS exhibits excellent scaling up to thousands of cores even for relatively small matrix sizes."			arxiv	['William Dawson', 'Michael Wagner', 'Damien Caliste', 'Takahito Nakajima', 'Luigi Genovese']	51.0

151	Are Chess Discussions Racist? An Adversarial Hate Speech Data Set	Rupak Sarkar	2020-11-20 08:50:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10280v1	"On June 28, 2020, while presenting a chess podcast on Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura, Antonio Radi\'c's YouTube handle got blocked because it contained ""harmful and dangerous"" content. YouTube did not give further specific reason, and the channel got reinstated within 24 hours. However, Radi\'c speculated that given the current political situation, a referral to ""black against white"", albeit in the context of chess, earned him this temporary ban. In this paper, via a substantial corpus of 681,995 comments, on 8,818 YouTube videos hosted by five highly popular chess-focused YouTube channels, we ask the following research question: \emph{how robust are off-the-shelf hate-speech classifiers to out-of-domain adversarial examples?} We release a data set of 1,000 annotated comments where existing hate speech classifiers misclassified benign chess discussions as hate speech. We conclude with an intriguing analogy result on racial bias with our findings pointing out to the broader challenge of color polysemy."			arxiv	['Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh']	53.0

This problem is of much interest for tournament organizers and amateur or professional players to broadcast their over-the-board (OTB) games online or analyze them using chess engines. Previous work has shown promising results, but the recognition accuracy and the latency of state-of-the-art techniques still need further enhancements to allow their practical and affordable deployment. We have investigated how to implement them on an Nvidia Jetson Nano single-board computer effectively. Our first contribution has been accelerating the chessboard's detection algorithm. Subsequently, we have analyzed different Convolutional Neural Networks for chess piece classification and how to map them efficiently on our embedded platform. Notably, we have implemented a functional framework that automatically digitizes a chess position from an image in less than 1 second, with 92% accuracy when classifying the pieces and 95% when detecting the board.			arxiv	['Alberto Antonio del Barrio Garc√≠a', 'Manuel Prieto Mat√≠as']	54.0
153	Complexity of Solo Chess with Unlimited Moves	Josh Brunner	2023-02-02 20:40:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01405v1	We analyze Solo Chess puzzles, where the input is an $n \times n$ board containing some standard Chess pieces of the same color, and the goal is to make a sequence of capture moves to reduce down to a single piece. Prior work analyzes this puzzle for a single piece type when each piece is limited to make at most two capture moves (as in the Solo Chess puzzles on chess.com). By contrast, we study when each piece can make an unlimited number of capture moves. We show that any single piece type can be solved in polynomial time in a general model of piece types, while any two standard Chess piece types are NP-complete. We also analyze the restriction (as on chess.com) that one piece type is unique and must be the last surviving piece, showing that in this case some pairs of piece types become tractable while others remain hard.			arxiv	['Lily Chung', 'Michael Coulombe', 'Erik D.

The paper suggests that pairwise comparison matrices perform well in similar ranking problems. Some features of the proposed method are illustrated by the results of the 18th European Team Chess Championship.

This paper proposes a possibly practical means of using machine learning to create two classes of narrow AI oracles that would provide chess advice: those aligned with the player's interest, and those that want the player to lose and give deceptively bad advice. The player would be uncertain which type of oracle it was interacting with. As the oracles would be vastly more intelligent than the player in the domain of chess, experience with these oracles might help us prepare for future artificial general intelligence oracles.			arxiv	['Roman Yampolskiy', 'Olle Haggstrom', 'Stuart Armstrong']	59.0

This is motivated by a chess problem. In an enumerative chess problem, the set of moves in the solution is (usually) unique, but the order is not. The task of counting the feasible permutations may be accomplished by solving an equivalent problem in enumerative combinatorics. Almost all such problems have been of a special type known as series movers. In this thesis we use generalized hypergeometric functions to enumerate SYT of battery shapes, and thus solve a chess problem posed by Buchanan.			arxiv	[]	60.0

159	A Popperian Falsification of Artificial Intelligence -- Lighthill Defended	Steven Meyer	2017-04-23 21:16:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08111v3	The area of computation called artificial intelligence (AI) is falsified by describing a previous 1972 falsification of AI by British mathematical physicist James Lighthill. How Lighthill's arguments continue to apply to current AI is explained. It is argued that AI should use the Popperian scientific method in which it is the duty of scientists to attempt to falsify theories and if theories are falsified to replace or modify them. The paper describes the Popperian method and discusses Paul Nurse's application of the method to cell biology that also involves questions of mechanism and behavior. It is shown how Lighthill's falsifying arguments especially combinatorial explosion continue to apply to modern AI. Various skeptical arguments against the assumptions of AI mostly by physicists especially against Hilbert's philosophical programme that defined knowledge and truth as provable formal sentences. John von Neumann's arguments from natural complexity against neural networks and evolutionary algorithms are discussed. Next the game of chess is discussed to show how modern chess experts have reacted to computer chess programs. It is shown that currently chess masters can defeat any chess program using Kasperov's arguments from his 1997 Deep Blue match and aftermath. The game of 'go' and climate models are discussed to show computer applications where combinatorial explosion may not apply. The paper concludes by advocating studying computation as Peter Naur's Dataology.			arxiv	[]	62.0
160	Chess is hard even for a single player	N. R. Aravind	2022-03-28 16:13:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14864v2	"We introduce a generalization of ""Solo Chess"", a single-player variant of the game that can be played on chess.com. The standard version of the game is played on a regular 8 x 8 chessboard by a single player, with only white pieces, using the following rules: every move must capture a piece, no piece may capture more than 2 times, and if there is a King on the board, it must be the final piece. The goal is to clear the board, i.e, make a sequence of captures after which only one piece is left. We generalize this game to unbounded boards with $n$ pieces, each of which have a given number of captures that they are permitted to make. We show that Generalized Solo Chess is NP-complete, even when it is played by only rooks that have at most two captures remaining. It also turns out to be NP-complete even when every piece is a queen with exactly two captures remaining in the initial configuration. In contrast, we show that solvable instances of Generalized Solo Chess can be completely characterized when the game is: a) played by rooks on a one-dimensional board, and b) played by pawns with two captures left on a 2D board. Inspired by Generalized Solo Chess, we also introduce the Graph Capture Game, which involves clearing a graph of tokens via captures along edges. This game subsumes Generalized Solo Chess played by knights. We show that the Graph Capture Game is NP-complete for undirected graphs and DAGs."			arxiv	['Neeldhara Misra', 'Harshil Mittal']	63.0
161	AI-powered mechanisms as judges: Breaking ties in chess and beyond	Nejat Anbarci	2022-10-15 13:27:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08289v2	Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology use has been rising in sports. For example, to reduce staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, major tennis tournaments replaced human line judges with Hawk-Eye Live technology. AI is now ready to move beyond such mundane tasks, however. A case in point and a perfect application ground is chess. To reduce the growing incidence of draws, many elite tournaments have resorted to fast chess tiebreakers. However, these tiebreakers are vulnerable to strategic manipulation, e.g., in the last game of the 2018 World Chess Championship, Magnus Carlsen -- in a significantly advantageous position -- offered a draw to Fabiano Caruana (whom accepted the offer) to proceed to fast chess tiebreaks in which Carlsen had even better odds of winning the championship. By contrast, we prove that our AI-based method can serve as a judge to break ties without being vulnerable to such manipulation. It relies on measuring the difference between the evaluations of a player's actual move and the best move as deemed by a powerful chess engine. If there is a tie, the player with the higher quality measure wins the tiebreak. We generalize our method to all competitive sports and games in which AI's superiority is -- or can be -- established.			arxiv	['Mehmet S. Ismail']	64.0
162	Cultural transmission of move choice in chess	Egor Lappo	2023-02-21 00:25:41	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10375v3	The study of cultural evolution benefits from detailed analysis of cultural transmission in specific human domains. Chess provides a platform for understanding the transmission of knowledge due to its active community of players, precise behaviors, and long-term records of high-quality data. In this paper, we perform an analysis of chess in the context of cultural evolution, describing multiple cultural factors that affect move choice. We then build a population-level statistical model of move choice in chess, based on the Dirichlet-multinomial likelihood, to analyze cultural transmission over decades of recorded games played by leading players. For moves made in specific positions, we evaluate the relative effects of frequency-dependent bias, success bias, and prestige bias on the dynamics of move frequencies. We observe that negative frequency-dependent bias plays a role in the dynamics of certain moves, and that other moves are compatible with transmission under prestige bias or success bias. These apparent biases may reflect recent changes, namely the introduction of computer chess engines and online tournament broadcasts. Our analysis of chess provides insights into broader questions concerning how social learning biases affect cultural evolution.			arxiv	['Noah A. Rosenberg', 'Marcus W. Feldman']	65.0

Specifically, using the example of the chess variant known as Switch-Side Chain-Chess (SSCC). Presently, no foolproof method of detecting such chains in any given chess position is known and existing graph theory, to our knowledge, is unable to fully address this problem either. We therefore propose a solution implemented and tested using the C++ programming language. We have been unable to find an incorrect result and therefore offer it as the most viable solution thus far to the chain-detection problem in this chess variant. The algorithm is also scalable, in principle, to areas beyond two-dimensional grids such as 3D analysis and molecular chemistry.			arxiv	['Azlan Iqbal']	69.0
167	Optimal Dimensionality Reduction of Complex Dynamics: The Chess Game as Diffusion on a Free Energy Landscape	Sergei V. Krivov	2011-03-18 18:21:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3681v1	Dimensionality reduction is ubiquitous in analysis of complex dynamics. The conventional dimensionality reduction techniques, however, focus on reproducing the underlying configuration space, rather than the dynamics itself. The constructed low-dimensional space does not provide complete and accurate description of the dynamics. Here I describe how to perform dimensionality reduction while preserving the essential properties of the dynamics. The approach is illustrated by analyzing the chess game - the archetype of complex dynamics. A variable that provides complete and accurate description of chess dynamics is constructed. Winning probability is predicted by describing the game as a random walk on the free energy landscape associated with the variable. The approach suggests a possible way of obtaining a simple yet accurate description of many important complex phenomena. The analysis of the chess game shows that the approach can quantitatively describe the dynamics of processes where human decision-making plays a central role, e.g., financial and social dynamics.			arxiv	[]	70.0
168	Estimating Total Search Space Size for Specific Piece Sets in Chess	Azlan Iqbal	2018-02-27 07:35:55	http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00874v1	Automatic chess problem or puzzle composition typically involves generating and testing various different positions, sometimes using particular piece sets. Once a position has been generated, it is then usually tested for positional legality based on the game rules. However, it is useful to be able to estimate what the search space size for particular piece combinations is to begin with. So if a desirable chess problem was successfully generated by examining 'merely' 100,000 or so positions in a theoretical search space of about 100 billion, this would imply the composing approach used was quite viable and perhaps even impressive. In this article, I explain a method of calculating the size of this search space using a combinatorics and permutations approach. While the mathematics itself may already be established, a precise method and justification of applying it with regard to the chessboard and chess pieces has not been documented, to the best of our knowledge. Additionally, the method could serve as a useful starting point for further estimations of search space size which filter out positions for legality and rotation, depending on how the automatic composer is allowed to place pieces on the board (because this affects its total search space size).			arxiv	[]	71.0

Our results show that using an appropriate expert (or mentor), we can evolve a program that is on par with top tournament-playing chess programs, outperforming a two-time World Computer Chess Champion. This performance gain is achieved by evolving a program that mimics the behavior of a superior expert. The resulting evaluation function of the evolved program consists of a much smaller number of parameters than the expert's. The extended experimental results provided in this paper include a report of our successful participation in the 2008 World Computer Chess Championship. In principle, our expert-driven approach could be used in a wide range of problems for which appropriate experts are available.			arxiv	['Moshe Koppel', 'Nathan S. Netanyahu']	72.0

The evaluation function of the program is evolved by learning from databases of (human) grandmaster games. At first, the organisms are evolved to mimic the behavior of human grandmasters, and then these organisms are further improved upon by means of coevolution. The search mechanism is evolved by learning from tactical test suites. Our results show that the evolved program outperforms a two-time world computer chess champion and is at par with the other leading computer chess programs.			arxiv	['H.

This problem represents a greater challenge from a creative standpoint because the checkmate is not always clear and the method of winning even less so. Creating a decisive chess problem of this type without the aid of an omniscient 7-piece endgame tablebase (and one that also abides by several chess composition conventions) would therefore be a challenge for most human players and composers working on their own. The fact that a small computer with relatively low processing power and memory was sufficient to compose such a problem using the DSNS approach in just 10 days is therefore noteworthy. In this report we document the event and result in some detail. It lends additional credence to the DSNS as a viable new approach in the field of computational creativity. In particular, in areas where human-like creativity is required for targeted or specific problems with no clear path to the solution.			arxiv	[]	74.0

The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. In contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go, by tabula rasa reinforcement learning from games of self-play. In this paper, we generalise this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve, tabula rasa, superhuman performance in many challenging domains. Starting from random play, and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case.			arxiv	['Thomas Hubert', 'Julian Schrittwieser', 'Ioannis Antonoglou', 'Matthew Lai', 'Arthur Guez', 'Marc Lanctot', 'Laurent Sifre', 'Dharshan Kumaran', 'Thore Graepel', 'Timothy Lillicrap', 'Karen Simonyan', 'Demis Hassabis']	75.0

However, one common element in these works is the necessity of a finely optimized look ahead algorithm. The particular interest of this research lies with creating a chess engine that is highly capable, but restricted in its look ahead depth. We train a deep neural network to serve as a static evaluation function, which is accompanied by a relatively simple look ahead algorithm. We show that our static evaluation function has encoded some semblance of look ahead knowledge, and is comparable to classical evaluation functions. The strength of our chess engine is assessed by comparing its proposed moves against those proposed by Stockfish. We show that, despite strict restrictions on look ahead depth, our engine recommends moves of equal strength in roughly $83\%$ of our sample positions.			arxiv	[]	77.0
175	The Chess Transformer: Mastering Play using Generative Language Models	David Noever	2020-08-02 18:04:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04057v5	This work demonstrates that natural language transformers can support more generic strategic modeling, particularly for text-archived games. In addition to learning natural language skills, the abstract transformer architecture can generate meaningful moves on a chessboard. With further fine-tuning, the transformer learns complex gameplay by training on 2.8 million chess games in Portable Game Notation. After 30,000 training steps, OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-2) optimizes weights for 774 million parameters. This fine-tuned Chess Transformer generates plausible strategies and displays game formations identifiable as classic openings, such as English or the Slav Exchange. Finally, in live play, the novel model demonstrates a human-to-transformer interface that correctly filters illegal moves and provides a novel method to challenge the transformer's chess strategies. We anticipate future work will build on this transformer's promise, particularly in other strategy games where features can capture the underlying complex rule syntax from simple but expressive player annotations.			arxiv	['Matt Ciolino', 'Josh Kalin']	78.0

On one hand, the decision-making processes need to take into account many options. On the other hand, the design of the system's logical architecture must consider various dependability concerns such as safety, reliability, and security. Moreover, in case of high-assurance systems, the analysis of such concerns must be performed with rigorous methods. In this paper, we present the new development of CHESS, a cross-domain, model-driven, component-based, and open-source tool for the development of high-integrity systems. We focus on the new recently distributed version of CHESS, which supports extended model-based development and analyses for safety and security concerns.

However, the complexity of natural language makes it challenging to ascertain how accurately these models are tracking the world state underlying the text. Motivated by this issue, we consider the task of language modeling for the game of chess. Unlike natural language, chess notations describe a simple, constrained, and deterministic domain. Moreover, we observe that the appropriate choice of chess notation allows for directly probing the world state, without requiring any additional probing-related machinery. We find that: (a) With enough training data, transformer language models can learn to track pieces and predict legal moves with high accuracy when trained solely on move sequences. (b) For small training sets providing access to board state information during training can yield significant improvements. (c) The success of transformer language models is dependent on access to the entire game history i.e. ""full attention"". Approximating this full attention results in a significant performance drop. We propose this testbed as a benchmark for future work on the development and analysis of transformer language models."			arxiv	['Sam Wiseman', 'Karen Livescu', 'Kevin Gimpel']	80.0

We find that they can serve as a tool for testing machine ability as well. Two of the leading chess engines, Stockfish and Leela Chess Zero (LCZero), employ significantly different methods during play. We use Plaskett's Puzzle, a famous endgame study from the late 1970s, to compare the two engines. Our experiments show that Stockfish outperforms LCZero on the puzzle. We examine the algorithmic differences between the engines and use our observations as a basis for carefully interpreting the test results. Drawing inspiration from how humans solve chess problems, we ask whether machines can possess a form of imagination. On the theoretical side, we describe how Bellman's equation may be applied to optimize the probability of winning. To conclude, we discuss the implications of our work on artificial intelligence (AI) and artificial general intelligence (AGI), suggesting possible avenues for future research.			arxiv	['Nick Polson', 'Alex Turk']	81.0

This question is of both scientific and practical interest. If the representations of strong neural networks bear no resemblance to human concepts, our ability to understand faithful explanations of their decisions will be restricted, ultimately limiting what we can achieve with neural network interpretability. In this work we provide evidence that human knowledge is acquired by the AlphaZero neural network as it trains on the game of chess. By probing for a broad range of human chess concepts we show when and where these concepts are represented in the AlphaZero network. We also provide a behavioural analysis focusing on opening play, including qualitative analysis from chess Grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik. Finally, we carry out a preliminary investigation looking at the low-level details of AlphaZero's representations, and make the resulting behavioural and representational analyses available online.			arxiv	['Andrei Kapishnikov', 'Nenad Toma≈°ev', 'Adam Pearce', 'Demis Hassabis', 'Been Kim', 'Ulrich Paquet', 'Vladimir Kramnik']	82.0
180	Chess tableaux, powers of two and affine Lie algebras	Antoine Labelle	2022-11-19 04:26:10	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10584v3	Chess tableaux are a special kind of standard Young tableaux where, in the chessboard coloring of the Young diagram, even numbers always appear in white cells and odd numbers in black cells. If, for $\lambda$ a partition of $n$, $\text{Chess}(\lambda)$ denotes the number of chess tableaux of shape $\lambda$, then Chow, Eriksson and Fan observed that $\displaystyle\sum_{\lambda \vdash n} \text{Chess}(\lambda)^2$ is divisible by unusually large powers of $2$. In this paper, we give an explanation for this phenomenon, proving a lower bound of $n-O(\sqrt{n})$ for the $2$-adic valuation of this sum and a generalization of it. We do this by exploiting a connection with a certain representation of the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}$ on the vector space with basis indexed by partitions. Our result about chess tableaux then follows from a study of the basic representation of $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}$ with coefficients taken from the ring of rational numbers with odd denominators.			arxiv	['Stoyan Dimitrov']	83.0
181	Improving Chess Commentaries by Combining Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning Engines	Andrew Lee	2022-12-15 23:38:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08195v1	Despite many recent advancements in language modeling, state-of-the-art language models lack grounding in the real world and struggle with tasks involving complex reasoning. Meanwhile, advances in the symbolic reasoning capabilities of AI have led to systems that outperform humans in games like chess and Go (Silver et al., 2018). Chess commentary provides an interesting domain for bridging these two fields of research, as it requires reasoning over a complex board state and providing analyses in natural language. In this work we demonstrate how to combine symbolic reasoning engines with controllable language models to generate chess commentaries. We conduct experiments to demonstrate that our approach generates commentaries that are preferred by human judges over previous baselines.			arxiv	['David Wu', 'Emily Dinan', 'Mike Lewis']	84.0
182	CHESS: A Framework for Evaluation of Self-adaptive Systems based on Chaos Engineering	Sehrish Malik	2023-03-13 17:00:55	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07283v1	There is an increasing need to assess the correct behavior of self-adaptive and self-healing systems due to their adoption in critical and highly dynamic environments. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluation methods for self-adaptive and self-healing systems. We proposed CHESS, a novel approach to address this gap by evaluating self-adaptive and self-healing systems through fault injection based on chaos engineering (CE) [ arXiv:2208.13227 ]. The artifact presented in this paper provides an extensive overview of the use of CHESS through two microservice-based case studies: a smart office case study and an existing demo application called Yelb. It comes with a managing system service, a self-monitoring service, as well as five fault injection scenarios covering infrastructure faults and functional faults. Each of these components can be easily extended or replaced to adopt the CHESS approach to a new case study, help explore its promises and limitations, and identify directions for future research.

The rules of the game arise naturally by combining the rules of conventional chess with key quantum-physical effects such as superposition and entanglement. Niel's Chess is recommended for ages 10 and above, to everyone who wishes to play a creative game with historical roots and at the same time gain intuition about the foundational quantum effects that power cutting-edge technologies like quantum computing and quantum communication, which are poised to revolutionise our society in the coming decades.			arxiv	[]	86.0
184	The Value of Chess Squares	Aditya Gupta	2023-07-08 20:17:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05330v2	We propose a neural network-based approach to calculate the value of a chess square-piece combination. Our model takes a triplet (Color, Piece, Square) as an input and calculates a value that measures the advantage/disadvantage of having this piece on this square. Our methods build on recent advances in chess AI, and can accurately assess the worth of positions in a game of chess. The conventional approach assigns fixed values to pieces $(\symking=\infty, \symqueen=9, \symrook=5, \symbishop=3, \symknight=3, \sympawn=1)$. We enhance this analysis by introducing marginal valuations. We use deep Q-learning to estimate the parameters of our model. We demonstrate our method by examining the positioning of Knights and Bishops, and also provide valuable insights into the valuation of pawns. Finally, we conclude by suggesting potential avenues for future research.			arxiv	['Shiva Maharaj', 'Nicholas Polson', 'Vadim Sokolov']	87.0
185	Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Chess960 Result and Develop Opening Themes	Shreyan Deo	2023-10-29 08:54:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18938v1	This work focuses on the analysis of Chess 960, also known as Fischer Random Chess, a variant of traditional chess where the starting positions of the pieces are randomized. The study aims to predict the game outcome using machine learning techniques and develop an opening theme for each starting position. The first part of the analysis utilizes machine learning models to predict the game result based on certain moves in each position. The methodology involves segregating raw data from .pgn files into usable formats and creating datasets comprising approximately 500 games for each starting position. Three machine learning algorithms -- KNN Clustering, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Trees -- have been used to predict the game outcome. To establish an opening theme, the board is divided into five regions: center, white kingside, white queenside, black kingside, and black queenside. The data from games played by top engines in all 960 positions is used to track the movement of pieces in the opening. By analysing the change in the number of pieces in each region at specific moves, the report predicts the region towards which the game is developing. These models provide valuable insights into predicting game outcomes and understanding the opening theme in Chess 960.			arxiv	['Nishchal Dwivedi']	88.0
186	Metric spaces in chess and international chess pieces graph diameters	Marco Rip√†	2023-10-31 17:50:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00016v3	This paper aims to study the graph radii and diameters induced by the $k$-dimensional versions of the well-known six international chess pieces on every finite $\{n \times n \times \dots \times n\} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^k$ lattice since they originate as many interesting metric spaces for any proper pair $(n,k)$. For this purpose, we finally discuss a mathematically consistent generalization of all the planar FIDE chess pieces to an appropriate $k$-dimensional environment, finding (for any $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$) the exact values of the graph radii and diameters of the $k$-rook, $k$-king, $k$-bishop, and the corresponding values for the $3$-queen, $3$-knight, and $3$-pawn. We also provide tight bounds for the graph radii and diameters of the $k$-queen, $k$-knight, and $k$-pawn, holding for any $k \geq 4$.			arxiv	[]	89.0
187	A study of memory effects in a chess database	Ana L. Schaigorodsky	2015-04-09 14:54:37	http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06611v2	A series of recent works studying a database of chronologically sorted chess games --containing 1.4 million games played by humans between 1998 and 2007-- have shown that the popularity distribution of chess game-lines follows a Zipf's law, and that time series inferred from the sequences of those game-lines exhibit long-range memory effects. The presence of Zipf's law together with long-range memory effects was observed in several systems, however, the simultaneous emergence of these two phenomena were always studied separately up to now. In this work, by making use of a variant of the Yule-Simon preferential growth model, introduced by Cattuto et al., we provide an explanation for the simultaneous emergence of Zipf's law and long-range correlations memory effects in a chess database. We find that Cattuto's Model (CM) is able to reproduce both, Zipf's law and the long-range correlations, including size-dependent scaling of the Hurst exponent for the corresponding time series. CM allows an explanation for the simultaneous emergence of these two phenomena via a preferential growth dynamics, including a memory kernel, in the popularity distribution of chess game-lines. This mechanism results in an aging process in the chess game-line choice as the database grows. Moreover, we find burstiness in the activity of subsets of the most active players, although the aggregated activity of the pool of players displays inter-event times without burstiness. We show that CM is not able to produce time series with bursty behavior providing evidence that burstiness is not required for the explanation of the long-range correlation effects in the chess database.			arxiv	['Juan I.

188	An Information Theoretic Analysis of Decision in Computer Chess	Alexandru Godescu	2011-12-09 16:50:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2144v1	The basis of the method proposed in this article is the idea that information is one of the most important factors in strategic decisions, including decisions in computer chess and other strategy games. The model proposed in this article and the algorithm described are based on the idea of a information theoretic basis of decision in strategy games . The model generalizes and provides a mathematical justification for one of the most popular search algorithms used in leading computer chess programs, the fractional ply scheme. However, despite its success in leading computer chess applications, until now few has been published about this method. The article creates a fundamental basis for this method in the axioms of information theory, then derives the principles used in programming the search and describes mathematically the form of the coefficients. One of the most important parameters of the fractional ply search is derived from fundamental principles. Until now this coefficient has been usually handcrafted or determined from intuitive elements or data mining. There is a deep, information theoretical justification for such a parameter. In one way the method proposed is a generalization of previous methods. More important, it shows why the fractional depth ply scheme is so powerful. It is because the algorithm navigates along the lines where the highest information gain is possible. A working and original implementation has been written and tested for this algorithm and is provided in the appendix. The article is essentially self-contained and gives proper background knowledge and references. The assumptions are intuitive and in the direction expected and described intuitively by great champions of chess.			arxiv	[]	91.0
189	Chessboard and chess piece recognition with the support of neural networks	Maciej A. Czyzewski	2017-08-13 12:34:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03898v3	Chessboard and chess piece recognition is a computer vision problem that has not yet been efficiently solved. However, its solution is crucial for many experienced players who wish to compete against AI bots, but also prefer to make decisions based on the analysis of a physical chessboard. It is also important for organizers of chess tournaments who wish to digitize play for online broadcasting or ordinary players who wish to share their gameplay with friends. Typically, such digitization tasks are performed by humans or with the aid of specialized chessboards and pieces. However, neither solution is easy or convenient. To solve this problem, we propose a novel algorithm for digitizing chessboard configurations. We designed a method that is resistant to lighting conditions and the angle at which images are captured, and works correctly with numerous chessboard styles. The proposed algorithm processes pictures iteratively. During each iteration, it executes three major sub-processes: detecting straight lines, finding lattice points, and positioning the chessboard. Finally, we identify all chess pieces and generate a description of the board utilizing standard notation. For each of these steps, we designed our own algorithm that surpasses existing solutions. We support our algorithms by utilizing machine learning techniques whenever possible. The described method performs extraordinarily well and achieves an accuracy over $99.5\%$ for detecting chessboard lattice points (compared to the $74\%$ for the best alternative), $95\%$ (compared to $60\%$ for the best alternative) for positioning the chessboard in an image, and almost $95\%$ for chess piece recognition.			arxiv	['Artur Laskowski', 'Szymon Wasik']	92.0
190	Structure constrained by metadata in networks of chess players	Nahuel Almeira	2017-07-31 14:33:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06694v2	Chess is an emblematic sport that stands out because of its age, popularity and complexity. It has served to study human behavior from the perspective of a wide number of disciplines, from cognitive skills such as memory and learning, to aspects like innovation and decision making. Given that an extensive documentation of chess games played throughout history is available, it is possible to perform detailed and statistically significant studies about this sport. Here we use one of the most extensive chess databases in the world to construct two networks of chess players. One of the networks includes games that were played over-the-board and the other contains games played on the Internet. We study the main topological characteristics of the networks, such as degree distribution and correlations, transitivity and community structure. We complement the structural analysis by incorporating players' level of play as node metadata. Although both networks are topologically different, we show that in both cases players gather in communities according to their expertise and that an emergent rich-club structure, composed by the top-rated players, is also present.			arxiv	['Ana Laura Schaigorodsky', 'Juan Ignacio Perotti', 'Orlando Vito Billoni']	93.0
191	Exploring the Performance of Deep Residual Networks in Crazyhouse Chess	Sun-Yu Gordon Chi	2019-08-25 10:18:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09296v1	Crazyhouse is a chess variant that incorporates all of the classical chess rules, but allows users to drop pieces captured from the opponent as a normal move. Until 2018, all competitive computer engines for this board game made use of an alpha-beta pruning algorithm with a hand-crafted evaluation function for each position. Previous machine learning-based algorithms for just regular chess, such as NeuroChess and Giraffe, took hand-crafted evaluation features as input rather than a raw board representation. More recent projects, such as AlphaZero, reached massive success but required massive computational resources in order to reach its final strength. This paper describes the development of SixtyFour, an engine designed to compete in the chess variant of Crazyhouse with limited hardware. This specific variant poses a multitude of significant challenges due to its large branching factor, state-space complexity, and the multiple move types a player can make. We propose the novel creation of a neural network-based evaluation function for Crazyhouse. More importantly, we evaluate the effectiveness of an ensemble model, which allows the training time and datasets to be easily distributed on regular CPU hardware commodity. Early versions of the network have attained a playing level comparable to a strong amateur on online servers.			arxiv	[]	94.0

The next generation of large space telescopes require highly sensitive, moderate-to-high resolution UV spectrograph. However, sensitive observations in the UV are difficult, as UV optical performance and imaging efficiencies have lagged behind counterparts in the visible and infrared regimes. This has historically resulted in simple, low-bounce instruments to increase sensitivity. In this study, we present the design, fabrication, and calibration of a simple, high resolution, high throughput far-UV spectrograph - the Colorado High-resolution Echelle Stellar Spectrograph (CHESS). CHESS is a sounding rocket payload to demonstrate the instrument design for the next-generation UV space telescopes. We present tests and results on the performance of several state-of-the-art diffraction grating and detector technologies for far-UV astronomical applications that were flown aboard the first two iterations of CHESS. The CHESS spectrograph was used to study the atomic-to-molecular transitions within translucent cloud regions in the interstellar medium (ISM) through absorption spectroscopy. The first two flights looked at the sightlines towards alpha Virgo and epsilon Persei, and flight results are presented.			arxiv	['Kevin France', 'Nicholas Nell', 'Robert Kane', 'Brian Fleming', 'Allison Youngblood', 'Matthew Beasley']	95.0
193	Analysis of subsystems with rooks on a chess-board representing a partial Latin square (Part 2.)	B√©la J√≥n√°s	2022-08-12 08:34:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06166v1	A partial Latin square of order $n$ can be represented by a $3$-dimensional chess-board of size $n\times n\times n$ with at most $n^2$ non-attacking rooks. In Latin squares, a subsystem and its most distant mate together have as many rooks as their capacity. That implies a simple capacity condition for the completion of partial Latin squares which is in fact the Cruse's necessary condition for characteristic matrices. Andersen-Hilton proved that, except for certain listed cases, a PLS of order $n$ can be completed if it contains only $n$ symbols. Andersen proved it for $n+1$ symbols, listing the cases to be excluded. Identifying the structures of the chess-board that can be overloaded with $n$ or $n+1$ rooks, it follows that a PLS derived from a chess-board with at most $n+1$ non-attacking rooks can be completed exactly if it satisfies the capacity condition. In a layer of a Latin square, two subsystems of a remote couple are in balance. Thus, a necessary condition for completion of a layer can be formulated, the balance condition. For an LSC, each 1-dimensional subspace of the chess-board contains exactly one rook. Consequently, for the PLSCs derived from partial Latin squares, we examine certain sets of 1-dimensional subspaces because they indicate the number of missing rooks.			arxiv	[]	96.0

As a relatively simple example, it is shown that chess exhibits chaotic behavior in its configuration space.

This game has roughly 9x10^{18} legal positions and is comparable in this respect with checkers. We weakly solve this game, that is we prove its game-theoretic value and give a strategy to draw against best play for White and Black sides. Our approach requires surprisingly small computing power. We give a human readable proof. The way the result is obtained is generic and could be generalized to bigger chess settings or to other games.			arxiv	['Frederic Prost']	102.0

211	100 Bullet (1+0) Games with Queen Odds: Results, Highlights, and Thoughts	Unknown	2024-01-04 12:37:58	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18yc73e/100_bullet_10_games_with_queen_odds_results/	"Hi all!

Link to the account: [https://lichess.org/@/OhNoHerMajesty](https://lichess.org/@/OhNoHerMajesty) &#x200B; The only rule for this challenge was to sacrifice my queen in the first three moves of the game to a pawn or a minor piece and leave it there until my opponent took it.

[https://lichess.org/0M0mf0zWHabG](https://lichess.org/0M0mf0zWHabG) Thoughts: 1) While I usually went for a quick attack in my initial games. Locking up the pawn structure and hoping to flag your opponents is a much better strategy. 2) There is a significant difference in my opponents' ability to deal with my bullshit between 2000 and 2100 Lichess. 2100 players simply deploy an attack to force me to trade all my pieces, then checkmate me in the endgame. 3) 1900 players usually struggle to win an already won game. There are countless times that I just shuffled a couple of minor pieces around at 15 points of material down to just stall out a game and flag them. 4) 1900 players are very good at spotting their tactics, however, they often overlook my traps. 5) Hope chess saved the day in many games but I think it is due to the high time pressure. I predict my Blitz (3+0) rating to be 1850 because of this. Hope you enjoyed reading this! Let me know your thoughts :)"	8.0	t3_18yc73e	reddit

236	Is Nihal Sarin shaping up to become the next Hikaru Nakamura in the chess world?	Unknown	2024-01-05 02:09:16	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18yv41e/is_nihal_sarin_shaping_up_to_become_the_next/	Just sitting around and thinking of generations, parrallels and styles (Maybe I've been watching too much One Piece) I was drawing comparisons between Nihal Sarin and Hikaru Nakamura. The young chess prodigy from India has showcased his lightning-fast moves and strategic brilliance in online blitz games, prompting my commparisons to Nakamura, a renowned grandmaster known for his dominance mainly in rapid and blitz formats. However, before any keykaps go flying, it is crucial to emphasize that this discussion is not about setting Nihal's path or predicting his future. Obviously he is his own person, with his own style and own goals. Rather, it is an exploration of the striking similarities between Nihal and Nakamuras play, especially in speed chess, both OTB and especially online. In the fast-paced realm of blitz chess, where quick decision-making is paramount, Nihal consistently demonstrates his prowess. His ability to outmaneuver opponents with sharp tactics and deep calculations echoes Nakamura's approach to the game. He seems to have a similar style of opening play reminiscent of that to a younger Hikaru, an interesting similarity between Nihal Sarin and Hikaru Nakamura is their approach to chess openings. Unlike some other grandmasters who often dive deep into opening preparations to gain an advantage, Nihal and Nakamura tend to adopt a more flexible strategy. Both players are known for not delving too deeply into the opening phase of the game, opting for more dynamic and adaptable setups. They might not always have a big advantage right out of the opening, but it also keeps their opponents guessing. So, while some grandmasters may spend a lot of time preparing specific opening lines, Nihal and Nakamura bring their own unique flair to the chessboard, showcasing a style that is not heavily reliant on pre-game preparations. This shared characteristic adds an extra layer to the intriguing similarities between these two talented players. l also think that you could discuss their similarities in classical play, In the early stages of their chess careers, both Nihal Sarin and Hikaru Nakamura displayed a pattern where their classical play initially lagged behind their prowess in blitz. Nihal, like a young Hikaru, showcased exceptional speed and creativity in faster time controls, catching the eye of many in the chess community. Just as Hikaru evolved into a well-rounded player, there is little doubt that Nihal will follow a similar trajectory. While his blitz performances may currently overshadow his classical achievements, the potential for Nihal to mature and excel in classical chess, just as Hikaru did, is evident. As Nihal gains experience and refines his understanding, the parallels with Hikaru's journey suggest a promising future where Nihal's classical play will undoubtedly catch up with his outstanding blitz skills. As Nihal continues to make strides in the chess world, the conversation around the striking similarities between his style and that of Hikaru Nakamura will continute to come up more and more. Will Nihal Sarin emerge as the next Hikaru Nakamura, leaving an indelible mark on the world of chess? Regardless of where he goes, this prodigy has some insane potential. I suppose only time will reveal the trajectory of this promising young talent. Just sharing thoughts. Opinions? https://youtu.be/sE18swoo0Eg?si=tXTnJ-xKtV8nDSqg	5.0	t3_18yv41e	reddit

I'm talking strictly from a spectator standpoint--my observation is chess is poorly organized and poorly presented to the public. Commentators often don't know the fundamentals of good TV commentary. They may be excellent players or analysts, but they aren't always good with a microphone. Press conferences are tedious with irrelevant or sometimes insulting questions. The overall production of some high-level tournament feels light years behind where it ought to be for a game as established as chess. Chess has hundreds of millions of players around the world. It's not lucrative in the same way any sport with a ball is, but it has money enough to pay out some big-time prizes. Why can't it have a more polished presentation? I can think of a half dozen relatively small or obscure sports with amazing production values: [darts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJSjXE9VrM4), [lumberjacking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbBZj1qOgiY), [death diving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-hVcOUF7Yk), [ultimate frisbee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APANLpQlizg), [billiards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2goGMdLFA1c), the [X Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjih_vQ9fU), and so on. A lot of you will probably point to the format of classical chess. It's slow, it rewards draws, etc. But I don't think that accounts for everything. A televised marathon race is very long, but the graphics, commentary, cutaways, and interviews keep it interesting enough for the viewer. Note: I'm speaking from the perspective of someone in the USA. I can't speak to chess broadcasts or media coverage in other parts of the world. TL;DR--the amateur production value of chess contradicts its large following around the world. Why?	62.0	t3_18xqa22	reddit

244	Is there a flowchart of chess strategy priorities?	Unknown	2024-01-04 21:56:32	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18yp5hw/is_there_a_flowchart_of_chess_strategy_priorities/	I was wondering if anyone has made a flowchart of some sort that shows the priorities in the decision making process which if followed should theoretically be at least a great move (at least immediately without seeing the long-term consequences of the position). For example, forking a queen and rook and knight is good (provided no checks can be made) but a better move would be threatening checkmate while also attacking their queen (as long as they cant defend with the queen) because it's almost guarenteed to win the queen. Hence if both moves are available the checkmate threat would be better. I get that's not a perfect example and I'm not asking someone to correct my example reasoning, but just wondering if a 'if;then' guide exists of some sort, or chess is not so simple to have something like that. Edit: Actually just after posting I realised how I could word my question better. Is there a guide where given a specific situation, it has a step by step thinking process of how you should deal with the situation? For example, if you're getting forked, you should try this this and this to escape the fork, and if you can threaten a fork yourself, you need to consider this this and this to make sure the fork is sound. I don't care if if you're pinned there's about 100 things you need to think of I just want to know what they all are.	4.0	t3_18yp5hw	reddit

Usually the runner up is an extremely high-level player who would have excellent chances of winning the next edition as well. If there is a tie then tiebreaks should be used to determine the spot. I believe this should ease the burden of having too many spots come from the world cup.

The Zonal Tournaments; different regional tournaments to qualify for the Interzonal. 2.) The Interzonal; the candidates qualification tournament which, in ‚Äò93, was replaced by the Knockout Chess Championship. This is the main thing I want back; it will completely wipe out the rating/wild card part of qualification, and avoid stunts such as Alireza‚Äôs Chartres Tourney. 3.) The Candidates Tournament; which has stayed mostly the same over the years (except for number of members sometimes fluctuating from 8 to 16). I am satisfied with the current state of the candidates. 4.) The World Chess Championship; again, I don‚Äôt think we need a change in that. What I really, really want back is the Interzonal.

Unknown	2024-01-05 14:51:56	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18z8nnj/chess_scandal_player_refuses_to_handshake_israeli/	There is much discussion in the media about the mass of players who are rebelling against the Israeli aphartaid regime and its crimes against humanity. However then of the invasion of Ukraine many players scared of the very rich and influential Russia lowered their heads. Now that it is about poor Israel which has no influence and denouncing it causes no ostracism and a peaceful career many players are raising their heads, why is that? Why is it so easy to criticize Israel without repercussions and if you criticize Russia you get ostracized? It is so a sad reality. Why doesn't Fide step in and penalize Russian players who support the invasion and are cutting career Israeli players who support their government and the war crimes perpetrated play freely? Edit: The brave player who sent the message of rebellion is Jan-Krzysztof Duda one of the top players at the moment, who showed that you can stand up against the bad ones but not all crimes against humanity are equal because apparently we are not all born equal for Fide and top chess players. It belongs to this sub because it is marked as news and not strategy, and the choice of the fide to sanction Israeli players because for the UN Israel is committing war crimes is not also applied to Russian players, because for the fide the Ukrainians have a life that is worth less because they are poorer than that other people who are experiencing genocide who are rich and influential. This choice is political. I had to write this post after watching this https://www.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/s/cPTDSirdFm and seeing the Duda's gesture at around the same time.

If they‚Äôre rated I will be able to see my progress, perhaps the pressure of the games being rated will help me take them more serious. On the other hand, maybe the reverse is more common, playing rated games can lead to more tilts, getting up in your head about losing ratings and ending up making stupid decisions under pressure.

To that end, I have compiled a master document of transcribed text from 375 speedrun videos covering about 185 hours of instructive content. This [blog post](https://lichess.org/@/Dsoul20/blog/danyas-general-advice--tips-quotes-from-gm-daniel-naroditskys-speedrun-videos/fmPtUgTj) covers 50 instructive Danya quotes related to general advice and tips. Below is one sample quote within each category. See the post for many more quotes! **Section 1 - Calculation** *The Sam Shanklin question* Ask yourself the Sam Shanklin question \[what if I do it anyway?\] People assume immediately that this pawn needs to be protected ... this is the power of not making these false assumptions. It's crucial do not let your brain tell you what's what before you have examined it from a concrete perspective. @ 20:00 mark, Beginner To Master | Chess Speedrun | French Defense **Section 2 - Art of Checkmate and Attack** *Mating nets* Do not to rush to give the first check that you see... When you're hunting the king you've got to be very careful that you don't let the king escape and you've got to ... build the map how could the king hypothetically escape? What is the pathway? And then you could tailor your sequence to prevent the king from reaching that pathway. **Section 3 - Tactics** *Evaluating if a pin dangerous* To evaluat\[e\] whether a pin is dangerous \[ask\] is there a pawn that protects the pinned piece? It's a lot more dangerous when there is no pawn defending the pinned piece \[and more pressure can be applied\]. When there is a pawn protecting the pin piece you shouldn't be too scared of it particularly \[if you have an unpinning move\] **Section 4 - Positional Chess** *Kinetic and potential energy of pieces* A piece may not be doing anything on one particular move or in one particular position but you should not ... abandon that piece entirely. You should think about where that piece can ultimately end up and how strong it can be. Sometimes the pieces that seem to do absolutely nothing end up being the pieces that win you the game when they open up that essentially is the concept of potential energy. **Section 5 - Winning Won Positions** *After your opponent blunders, stay alert for opportunities* If your opponent blunders something, particularly material, that next move after you take the material can be very important because ... your opponent \[might be\] tilting \[and\] will offer you an opportunity to expand your advantage. Or because he's now lacking that material you have to understand what bearing that has on the position. So maybe he's lost a bishop and that bishop was defending a square which can now be occupied by a knight. So don't simply take the material and then relax. Try to understand how the material gain has impacted the landscape of the position **Section 6 - Saving lost positions and swindling** When you've blundered, when you're down a piece, you want your opponent to believe that you're basically tilted and blundering more. That's where these tactics come from... You want to lull your opponent into that sense that you're just actually tilting and blundering more pieces and this is how you set traps. **Section 7 - Openings** *Stay flexible with openings* When you learn an opening system ... it's very important not to be dogmatic. People get into trouble when they try to play the same system, regardless of what the opponent does. That's a recipe for failure, because you have to be flexible enough to react appropriately when your opponent plays something weird. **Section 8 - Endgames** The common phrase that is used here in endgames ... is ""do not hurry"". That's sort of a russian kind of maxim that's told often to beginners and that means several things. First of all, there's a tendency to play fast in the end game. Second ... there's a tendency to just try to rush your ideas but sometimes you just want to improve your position and that is the most effective way of converting an advantage quite often.

Not long ago Daniil Dubov and Ian Nepomniachtchi were penalised half a point each because they started playing dubious moves that led to a knight dance. They finally called it a draw after sharing a laugh and placing the knights at there starting position. Yet 3 years ago we saw Hikaru and Magnus did something really similar by playing the infamous and dubious double bongcloud, sharing a laugh and ending the game by a draw. I feel like I'm missing something since the outcome wasn't interpreted in the same way. Is it because the recent match felt more as pre-arranged versus the double bongcloud was more an ""on the spot"" draw ? I just feel that both events should have been treated the same.

It is a knockout tournament (select 4 out of the other 8 players, then go against the aforementioned 4 seeded players). Time control is 2x 15+10, if tied then 2x 3+2, and then Armageddon. This will be the first time Ding plays an official chess tournament since Superbet Romania. Looks like the World Champ is indeed coming out of inactivity. Ding and Wei Yi should be flying to the Netherlands immediately afterwards for Tata Steel 2024. https://m.chinanews.com/wap/detail/zw/ty/2024/01-02/10139480.shtml	12.0	t3_18wo7oj	reddit

314	Got a nice chess board for Christmas - the best and worst gift I‚Äôve ever received	Unknown	2024-01-02 23:01:36	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18x38bg/got_a_nice_chess_board_for_christmas_the_best_and/	Hey guys. I have a bit of a first world problem in a third world country. I‚Äôve loved every minute of being a part of the chess world. I‚Äôm a cliche post-Queen‚Äôs Gambiter. Having played Dota 2 most of my teens and twenties, chess became a new passion. I‚Äôm nothing special (online rapid 1650/blitz+bullet 1350), but im passionate nonetheless. Here lies my problem. Nobody I know can play anywhere close to my level. Even with pawn or knight/bishop odds. I do my utmost to coach beginners friends/family, guide them through games against me, teach basic principles, encourage those with decent puzzle solving talent etc. No dice. Nobody is interested enough to put in the time. I live a good 2 hours from the nearest major city in South Africa, and have so far come up real short finding anyone to play against. I‚Äôve just been gifted an amazing chess board for Christmas. I‚Äôm so grateful for the gift and the prospect of playing on it both excites and depresses me. On one hand, I can picture what I see on YouTube videos and twitch streams all the time: meeting people in pubs in Europe, coffee shops or beachfronts in California, parks in New York. I long for that sort of environment where I can share my passion with other like minded people. Share. Learn. Enjoy. Compete. Smile. On the other hand, the realities of my location make this sort of a sad gift to receive, where the giver hasn‚Äôt really understood that it takes 2 people to play a game of chess. They know I love the game, but what they don‚Äôt know is I‚Äôve spent a lot of time trying to find people to play against, and failed. All I can do is come here and ask for advice. I can‚Äôt be the only person on here with this problem. TLDR; I‚Äôve pigeon-holed myself into a passion that I cannot share. My local area is bound to have at least some chess players, but there is for certain no club or venue where I can meet them, no tournaments, no social media connection etc. What to do?	9.0	t3_18x38bg	reddit

In general I think my strategic gamesense and having a mid-game plan are really weak, so I'd appreciate any commentary in that vein, but anything is welcomed. I just played a game where I felt I could have exploited the lack of development from my opponent far better but was kind of at a loss to do so, apart from thinking that I should break whilst I was ahead in development to open up the board? https://lichess.org/4JlCESKTnCNR My thoughts: Most unsure about [9. d5], here I was trying to break but unsure if that was the best way to go about it, as it isolates my e pawn and opens a nice diagonal for their dark bishop. Would e5 be better here? The tension between his b file pawn and my c file was distracting, but I don't think opening it up that way would serve me at all, giving them a semi open file. A lot of trades after [15. Nd4] also that I'm unsure serve me. I was wondering instead about just ramming my a file pawn up the board move [14.], but instead started threatening his weak d pawn and centralised my rook. Good move? [18. Ra4] looks really passive in hindsight and dropping tempo, letting him castle, though his king is obviously still very exposed. Perhaps instead of pushing my a/b file pawns following this my plan should be to get my pieces in a lot more of an active position towards his king directly? You can see my thoughts about the mid game kind of lack a plan, I'm not exactly sure how to exploit my opponents weaknesses outside tactical play or just super high level themes like ""break"".

I would estimate that the 3:2 pool on chesscom is about 150-200 elo points stronger than the 5:0 pool, i.e. a 1900 player in the 3:2 pool is a 2100 player in the 5:0 pool. What is your experience? And how does the 3:0 pool compare to the 3:2 pool? Is the 3:0 pool harder or easier than the 3:2 pool (when it comes to gaining elo)? EDIT: I dont think its me being inexperienced with the 3:2 time format, as I notice it in the openings that the players are stronger at the same rating in the 3:2 pool vs the 5:0 pool. 5:0 guys downvoting. Try it out for yourselves before you shoot the messenger :). Update: Just read a thread on chesscom that 3:2 is harder than 3:0 by quite a bit. Theory by one poster is that the less popular a pool is the harder it is. So if I assume that 3:2 is actually harder than 3:0, then the pool strength is 5:0 easiest, followed by 3:0 followed by 3:2. Could be a 100 gap between each category, so 3:2 would be 200 elo deflated vs 5:0 and 100 vs 3:0. Havent tested it though for the 3:0.	10.0	t3_18xi8cy	reddit

335	Stop checking me	Unknown	2024-01-03 15:45:36	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18xme0s/stop_checking_me/	"Yes, that means you. No, seriously, stop checking me. For context, I like to finish my day with just a few unrated quick blitz games on lichess. I have to confess that I don't play well when I'm tired, and often I end up doing something dumb. But it's OK. I just convert into an endgame and win. No problem. Now considering how many people just don't look at endgames at all, you would think that people would find all sorts of interesting ways to ruin their endgames, but surprisingly not. The main error that just seems to reappear again and again is always the same: They check me. Huh? Let's take a step back, shall we? What makes an endgame an endgame? That there are fewer pieces on the board, so the King is harder to mate and therefore it becomes an attacking piece. And the purpose of the game is no longer to mate your opponent, but to create a new queen and *then* mate your opponent. Why is the King such a great piece? Well, because it can move in all directions and can therefore snake its way through any pawn chain and start gobbling them up. But the real problem of the King is also very visible: It's so bloody slow. It takes 3-4 moves for a castled King to get to centre. It takes a passed pawn 5 moves to get from second rank to the queening square for comparison. So what exactly are you doing, when you check me? Yup, that's right: *You are giving my King a tempo!* If the Kings face off on third and fifth rank or on fourth and sixth rank makes a huge difference in the matter of who can reach what pawns. If you give me a check and my King is heading somewhere, you are not just helping me, you might in fact just have made a decisive mistake. Here's a thought experiment: Rook endgame. White has King on g1 and pawns on a2, f3 and g4. White's rook is ... I dunno ... in the bathroom or something. Black plays 1. -,Rc1+. 2. Kf2, Rc2+. 3. Ke3, Rxa2. 4. Ke4 and hey, Black has won the a-pawn with tempo. Except: White's King went from the back rank to the middle of the board from where it can now start attack Black's pawns. Compare to 1. -,Rc2. 2. a4, Ra2 where now Black did not win any pawns, but on the other hand, he has locked in the white King. Next, Black centralises his King and only then starts using his rook to take pawns. Is one better than the other? Hard to say. Depends on the position. I just want to make the point that three moves for the opposing King is not ""free"". It's a tradeoff and should be evaluated as such. Of course there are no rules without exception and sometimes the opposing King is on the optimal square and a check is just what the doctor ordered. Or you could be fishing for a perpetual. Or you might actually have seen the full mating net. I can't tell you to never check in the endgame. That would be silly. Mainly I just want to make sure to remove the thought ""Ooo, I can check my opponent. *Endorphine rush!!!*"" and replace it with ""Hmm, I might have to check my opponent. What do I get in return?"" TL;DR: Stop checking me. My King hasn't done you anything."	3.0	t3_18xme0s	reddit

Unknown	2024-01-03 20:06:03	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18xsm80/if_i_spend_everyday_studying_1_page_from/	I heard a lot talk that DEM is a very advanced and tough book that even titled players struggle against. And I feel like most of the struggle can be mitigated by taking a long term approach to studying and really integrating oneself to really understand what the subject is. I feel fairly decent when it comes to chess (2150 bullet lichess lol) but I really don't care for anything else than endgame mastery. I know there are better ways to get better at chess but mastering the endgame is something I enjoy and might even only study in regards to chess. It seems like a player could mimic a GM when it comes to the opening by brute memorization with hopes that no novelty is to be played. But what about the endgame? Capablanca did say the endgame must be mastered before anything else. If I study DEM everyday and if once finished, I would repeat the process so I can attempt to know the book by heart, can I be GM in the endgame in 5 years?	9.0	t3_18xsm80	reddit

Anyway, I want chess to be my main career and goal (path) as a job, I know I cannot truly rely on that dream but I still want to go with that. I have lots of work and stress from school so I can't play chess and go with my path, as we all know chess takes lots of time and anti socializing (training and playing by yourself) to actually become better. So whenever I try to play at chess at chess.com I always think of school im the middle of my game and lose focus. I cannot think through some moves cause of my losing focus during games, which immediatelly makes my games harder and more mentally draining so I can get fatigue after 2 games, which again surely doesn't help me in any way for my growth as a chess player. I play a few tournaments here and there when they are organized near my location since there arent much people to drive me to them and I am still a minor and don't have a driving license or a car (obviously). Some of you may say that I just need to focus on school and more, sure but nobody really thinks of my own dreams and my family just wants me to study 24/7, when I do study (about 3 hours when I do) they say I didn't? Ultimately I don't have a chance to become a better player and a better person, when I do turn 18 (not a minor anymore, and again obviously) I plan on seriously taking chess, sometimes still forget in what kind of mental state I am. Goodbye, thank you for reading this long post, and hope you have a wonderful day.	6.0	t3_18xhxvv	reddit

Using Elo ratings we compute for every player his expected score in a game with a randomly selected player from the pool. We use this figure as player's merit. We measure players' fame as the number of Google hits. The correlation between fame and merit is 0.38. At the same time the correlation between the logarithm of fame and merit is 0.61.

In previous work we demonstrated how combining photographs of people and sequences taken from chess games between weak players can be used to generate chess problems or puzzles of higher aesthetic quality, on average, compared to alternative approaches. In this work we show experimentally that using larger images as opposed to smaller ones improves the output quality even further. The same is also true for using clearer or less corrupted images. The reasons why these things influence the DSNS process is presently not well-understood and debatable but the findings are nevertheless immediately applicable for obtaining better results.			arxiv	[]	105.0

We consider Gardner's minichess variant in which all pieces are set as in a standard chessboard (from Rook to King). This game has roughly 9x10^{18} legal positions and is comparable in this respect with checkers. We weakly solve this game, that is we prove its game-theoretic value and give a strategy to draw against best play for White and Black sides. Our approach requires surprisingly small computing power. We give a human readable proof. The way the result is obtained is generic and could be generalized to bigger chess settings or to other games.			arxiv	['Frederic Prost']	107.0

356	Modeling Precomputation In Games Played Under Computational Constraints	Thomas Orton	2021-05-19 14:06:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09145v1	Understanding the properties of games played under computational constraints remains challenging. For example, how do we expect rational (but computationally bounded) players to play games with a prohibitively large number of states, such as chess? This paper presents a novel model for the precomputation (preparing moves in advance) aspect of computationally constrained games. A fundamental trade-off is shown between randomness of play, and susceptibility to precomputation, suggesting that randomization is necessary in games with computational constraints. We present efficient algorithms for computing how susceptible a strategy is to precomputation, and computing an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium of our model. Numerical experiments measuring the trade-off between randomness and precomputation are provided for Stockfish (a well-known chess playing algorithm).			arxiv	[]	109.0

Upper bounds are obtained by solving entanglement problems, that is to find good Lovasz umbrellas, quantum state realizations of the graph. We observe that optimal states are always pure states. The rest is expository. One general interesting question is whether the Shannon capacity is always some n-th root of the independence number of the n'th power of the graph.			arxiv	[]	110.0

359	An upper bound for the number of chess diagrams without promotion	Daniel Gourion	2021-12-17 08:45:54	http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09386v1	The number of legal chess diagrams without promotion is bounded from above by 2 x 10 40. This number is obtained by restricting both bishops and pawns position and by a precise bound when no chessman has been captured. We improve this estimate and show that the number of diagrams is less than 4 x 10 37. To achieve this, we define a graph on the set of diagrams and a notion of class of pawn structure, leading to a method for bounding pawn positions with any number of men on the board.			arxiv	[]	112.0

The probabilistic properties of Elo's rating system have long been studied, and we provide an application of such methods. By applying a Brownian motion model of Stern as a simple tool we provide answers. Our research also has fundamental bearing on the choice of the $K$-factor used in Elo's system for GrandMaster (GM) chess play.

The competition provided a historical dataset of outcomes for chess games, and aimed to discover whether novel approaches can predict the outcomes of future games, more accurately than the well-known Elo rating system. The winning rating system, called Elo++ in the rest of the article, builds upon the Elo rating system. Like Elo, Elo++ uses a single rating per player and predicts the outcome of a game, by using a logistic curve over the difference in ratings of the players. The major component of Elo++ is a regularization technique that avoids overfitting these ratings. The dataset of chess games and outcomes is relatively small and one has to be careful not to draw ""too many conclusions"" out of the limited data. Many approaches tested in the competition showed signs of such an overfitting. The leader-board was dominated by attempts that did a very good job on a small test dataset, but couldn't generalize well on the private hold-out dataset. The Elo++ regularization takes into account the number of games per player, the recency of these games and the ratings of the opponents. Finally, Elo++ employs a stochastic gradient descent scheme for training the ratings, and uses only two global parameters (white's advantage and regularization constant) that are optimized using cross-validation."			arxiv	[]	116.0

In this paper, we describe three astronomy payloads developed (or in development) by the Ultraviolet Rocket Group at the University of Colorado. These far-ultraviolet (100 - 160 nm) spectrographic instruments are used to study a range of scientific topics, from gas in the interstellar medium (accessing diagnostics of material spanning five orders of magnitude in temperature in a single observation) to the energetic radiation environment of nearby exoplanetary systems. The three instruments, SLICE, CHESS, and SISTINE form a progression of instrument designs and component-level technology maturation. SLICE is a pathfinder instrument for the development of new data handling, storage, and telemetry techniques. CHESS and SISTINE are testbeds for technology and instrument design enabling high-resolution (R > 100,000) point source spectroscopy and high throughput imaging spectroscopy, respectively, in support of future Explorer, Probe, and Flagship-class missions. The CHESS and SISTINE payloads support the development and flight testing of large-format photon-counting detectors and advanced optical coatings: NASA's top two technology priorities for enabling a future flagship observatory (e.g., the LUVOIR Surveyor concept) that offers factors of roughly 50 - 100 gain in ultraviolet spectroscopy capability over the Hubble Space Telescope.

365	Explain Your Move: Understanding Agent Actions Using Specific and Relevant Feature Attribution	Nikaash Puri	2019-12-23 07:52:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12191v4	As deep reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to more tasks, there is a need to visualize and understand the behavior of learned agents. Saliency maps explain agent behavior by highlighting the features of the input state that are most relevant for the agent in taking an action. Existing perturbation-based approaches to compute saliency often highlight regions of the input that are not relevant to the action taken by the agent. Our proposed approach, SARFA (Specific and Relevant Feature Attribution), generates more focused saliency maps by balancing two aspects (specificity and relevance) that capture different desiderata of saliency. The first captures the impact of perturbation on the relative expected reward of the action to be explained. The second downweighs irrelevant features that alter the relative expected rewards of actions other than the action to be explained. We compare SARFA with existing approaches on agents trained to play board games (Chess and Go) and Atari games (Breakout, Pong and Space Invaders). We show through illustrative examples (Chess, Atari, Go), human studies (Chess), and automated evaluation methods (Chess) that SARFA generates saliency maps that are more interpretable for humans than existing approaches. For the code release and demo videos, see https://nikaashpuri.github.io/sarfa-saliency/.			arxiv	['Sukriti Verma', 'Piyush Gupta', 'Dhruv Kayastha', 'Shripad Deshmukh', 'Balaji Krishnamurthy', 'Sameer Singh']	118.0

One common question asked of such data is that of approximate search ($\rho-$nearest neighbors search). We present a hierarchical search algorithm for such data sets that takes advantage of particular geometric properties apparent in both astronomical and biological data sets, namely the metric entropy and fractal dimensionality of the data. We present CHESS (Clustered Hierarchical Entropy-Scaling Search), a search tool with virtually no loss in specificity or sensitivity, demonstrating a $13.6\times$ speedup over linear search on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's APOGEE data set and a $68\times$ speedup on the GreenGenes 16S metagenomic data set, as well as asymptotically fewer distance comparisons on APOGEE when compared to the FALCONN locality-sensitive hashing library. CHESS demonstrates an asymptotic complexity not directly dependent on data set size, and is in practice at least an order of magnitude faster than linear search by performing fewer distance comparisons. Unlike locality-sensitive hashing approaches, CHESS can work with any user-defined distance function. CHESS also allows for implicit data compression, which we demonstrate on the APOGEE data set. We also discuss an extension allowing for efficient k-nearest neighbors search."			arxiv	['George Student', 'Noah M. Daniels']	119.0
367	A Novel Machine Learning Method for Preference Identification	Azlan Iqbal	2020-10-22 07:43:37	http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13517v2	Human preference or taste within any domain is usually a difficult thing to identify or predict with high probability. In the domain of chess problem composition, the same is true. Traditional machine learning approaches tend to focus on the ability of computers to process massive amounts of data and continuously adjust 'weights' within an artificial neural network to better distinguish between say, two groups of objects. Contrasted with chess compositions, there is no clear distinction between what constitutes one and what does not; even less so between a good one and a poor one. We propose a computational method that is able to learn from existing databases of 'liked' and 'disliked' compositions such that a new and unseen collection can be sorted with increased probability of matching a solver's preferences. The method uses a simple 'change factor' relating to the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) of each composition's starting position, coupled with repeated statistical analysis of sample pairs from both databases. Tested using the author's own collections of computer-generated chess problems, the experimental results showed that the method was able to sort a new and unseen collection of compositions such that, on average, over 70% of the preferred compositions were in the top half of the collection. This saves significant time and energy on the part of solvers as they are likely to find more of what they like sooner. The method may even be applicable to other domains such as image processing because it does not rely on any chess-specific rules but rather just a sufficient and quantifiable 'change' in representation from one object to the next.			arxiv	[]	120.0
368	Gambits: Theory and Evidence	Shiva Maharaj	2021-10-05 12:02:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02755v5	Gambits are central to human decision-making. Our goal is to provide a theory of Gambits. A Gambit is a combination of psychological and technical factors designed to disrupt predictable play. Chess provides an environment to study gambits and behavioral game theory. Our theory is based on the Bellman optimality path for sequential decision-making. This allows us to calculate the $Q$-values of a Gambit where material (usually a pawn) is sacrificed for dynamic play. On the empirical side, we study the effectiveness of a number of popular chess Gambits. This is a natural setting as chess Gambits require a sequential assessment of a set of moves (a.k.a. policy) after the Gambit has been accepted. Our analysis uses Stockfish 14.1 to calculate the optimal Bellman $Q$ values, which fundamentally measures if a position is winning or losing. To test whether Bellman's equation holds in play, we estimate the transition probabilities to the next board state via a database of expert human play. This then allows us to test whether the \emph{Gambiteer} is following the optimal path in his decision-making. Our methodology is applied to the popular Stafford and reverse Stafford (a.k.a. Boden-Kieretsky-Morphy) Gambit and other common ones including the Smith-Morra, Goring, Danish and Halloween Gambits. We build on research in human decision-making by proving an irrational skewness preference within agents in chess. We conclude with directions for future research.			arxiv	['Nicholas Polson', 'Christian Turk']	121.0

Each cell is identified by a $d$-tuple $(e_1,e_2,\ldots ,e_d)$ where $e_i \in \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}$. For $d = 3$ we prove that such a chess-board represents precisely one main class. A subsystem $T$ induced by a family of sets $<E_1,E_2,\ldots ,E_d>$ over $\{1,2,\ldots ,n\}$ is real if $E_i \subset \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}$ for each $i \in \{1,2,\ldots ,d\}$. The density of $T$ is the ratio of contained rooks to the number of cells in $T$. The distance between two subsystems is the minimum Hamming distance between cell pairs. Replacing $k$ sets of $<E_1,E_2,\ldots ,E_d>$ by their complements, a subsystem $U$ is obtained with distance $k$ between $T$ and $U$. All these subsystems, including $T$, form a partition of the chess-board. We prove that in such a partition, the number of rooks in a $U$ and the density of $U$ can be determined from the number of rooks in $T$ and the number of cells in $T$ and $U$ and the value of $(-1)^k$. We examine the subsystem couple $(T,U)$ in the $2$- and $3$-dimensional cases, where $U$ is the most distant unique subsystem from a real $T$. On the fly, a new identity of binomial coefficients is proved.			arxiv	[]	122.0

371	Diversifying AI: Towards Creative Chess with AlphaZero	Tom Zahavy	2023-08-17 20:27:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09175v2	In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have surpassed human intelligence in a variety of computational tasks. However, AI systems, like humans, make mistakes, have blind spots, hallucinate, and struggle to generalize to new situations. This work explores whether AI can benefit from creative decision-making mechanisms when pushed to the limits of its computational rationality. In particular, we investigate whether a team of diverse AI systems can outperform a single AI in challenging tasks by generating more ideas as a group and then selecting the best ones. We study this question in the game of chess, the so-called drosophila of AI. We build on AlphaZero (AZ) and extend it to represent a league of agents via a latent-conditioned architecture, which we call AZ_db. We train AZ_db to generate a wider range of ideas using behavioral diversity techniques and select the most promising ones with sub-additive planning. Our experiments suggest that AZ_db plays chess in diverse ways, solves more puzzles as a group and outperforms a more homogeneous team. Notably, AZ_db solves twice as many challenging puzzles as AZ, including the challenging Penrose positions. When playing chess from different openings, we notice that players in AZ_db specialize in different openings, and that selecting a player for each opening using sub-additive planning results in a 50 Elo improvement over AZ. Our findings suggest that diversity bonuses emerge in teams of AI agents, just as they do in teams of humans and that diversity is a valuable asset in solving computationally hard problems.			arxiv	['Vivek Veeriah', 'Shaobo Hou', 'Kevin Waugh', 'Matthew Lai', 'Edouard Leurent', 'Nenad Tomasev', 'Lisa Schut', 'Demis Hassabis', 'Satinder Singh']	124.0

We present some experiments in both chess and backgammon which demonstrate its utility and provide comparisons with TD(lambda) and another less radical variant, TD-directed(lambda). In particular, our chess program, ``KnightCap,'' used TDLeaf(lambda) to learn its evaluation function while playing on the Free Internet Chess Server (FICS, fics.onenet.net). It improved from a 1650 rating to a 2100 rating in just 308 games. We discuss some of the reasons for this success and the relationship between our results and Tesauro's results in backgammon.			arxiv	['Andrew Tridgell', 'Lex Weaver']	125.0
373	KnightCap: A chess program that learns by combining TD(lambda) with game-tree search	Jonathan Baxter	1999-01-10 03:21:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9901002v1	In this paper we present TDLeaf(lambda), a variation on the TD(lambda) algorithm that enables it to be used in conjunction with game-tree search. We present some experiments in which our chess program ``KnightCap'' used TDLeaf(lambda) to learn its evaluation function while playing on the Free Internet Chess Server (FICS, fics.onenet.net). The main success we report is that KnightCap improved from a 1650 rating to a 2150 rating in just 308 games and 3 days of play. As a reference, a rating of 1650 corresponds to about level B human play (on a scale from E (1000) to A (1800)), while 2150 is human master level. We discuss some of the reasons for this success, principle among them being the use of on-line, rather than self-play.			arxiv	['Andrew Tridgell', 'Lex Weaver']	126.0

This affirmatively solves a strengthened version of the Chess conjecture [DS Chess, A note on the classes [S_1^k(f)], Proc. Symp.

375	Zipf law in the popularity distribution of chess openings	B. Blasius	2007-04-20 13:38:20	http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2711v2	We perform a quantitative analysis of extensive chess databases and show that the frequencies of opening moves are distributed according to a power-law with an exponent that increases linearly with the game depth, whereas the pooled distribution of all opening weights follows Zipf's law with universal exponent. We propose a simple stochastic process that is able to capture the observed playing statistics and show that the Zipf law arises from the self-similar nature of the game tree of chess. Thus, in the case of hierarchical fragmentation the scaling is truly universal and independent of a particular generating mechanism. Our findings are of relevance in general processes with composite decisions.			arxiv	['R. Toenjes']	128.0
376	The $n$-Queens Problem in Higher Dimensions	Jeremiah Barr	2007-12-14 09:17:04	http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2309v1	A well-known chessboard problem is that of placing eight queens on the chessboard so that no two queens are able to attack each other. (Recall that a queen can attack anything on the same row, column, or diagonal as itself.) This problem is known to have been studied by Gauss, and can be generalized to an (n \times n) board, where (n \geq 4). We consider this problem in $d$-dimensional chess spaces, where (d \geq 3), and obtain the result that in higher dimensions, $n$ queens do not always suffice (in any arrangement) to attack all board positions. Our methods allow us to obtain the first lower bound on the number of queens that are necessary to attack all positions in a $d$-dimensional chess space of size $n$, and further to show that for any $k$, there are higher-dimensional chess spaces in which not all positions can be attacked by (n^k) queens.			arxiv	['Shrisha Rao']	129.0
377	A Methodology for Learning Players' Styles from Game Records	Mark Levene	2009-04-16 21:30:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2595v1	We describe a preliminary investigation into learning a Chess player's style from game records. The method is based on attempting to learn features of a player's individual evaluation function using the method of temporal differences, with the aid of a conventional Chess engine architecture. Some encouraging results were obtained in learning the styles of two recent Chess world champions, and we report on our attempt to use the learnt styles to discriminate between the players from game records by trying to detect who was playing white and who was playing black. We also discuss some limitations of our approach and propose possible directions for future research. The method we have presented may also be applicable to other strategic games, and may even be generalisable to other domains where sequences of agents' actions are recorded.			arxiv	['Trevor Fenner']	130.0
378	A streamlined approach to mapping the magnetic induction of skyrmionic materials	Jordan J. Chess	2016-08-21 21:11:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06000v2	Recently, Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) has helped researchers advance the emerging field of magnetic skyrmions. These magnetic quasi-particles, composed of topologically non-trivial magnetization textures, have a large potential for application as information carriers in low-power memory and logic devices. LTEM is one of a very few techniques for direct real space imaging of magnetic features at the nanoscale. For Fresnel-contrast LTEM, the transport of intensity equation (TIE) is the tool of choice for quantitative reconstruction of the local magnetic induction through the sample thickness. Typically this analysis requires collection of at least three images.Here we show that for uniform thin magnetic films which includes many skyrmionic samples, the magnetic induction can be quantitatively determined from a single defocused image using a simplified TIE approach.			arxiv	['Sergio A.

First, we propose an n-tuple network to extract features, since n-tuple networks require very little expert knowledge through its large numbers of features, while simulta-neously allowing easy access. Second, we propose a novel evalua-tion method that incorporates tapered eval into CT. Experiments show that with the same features and the same Chinese chess program, the automatically tuned comparison training feature weights achieved a win rate of 86.58% against the weights that were hand-tuned. The above trained version was then improved by adding additional features, most importantly n-tuple features. This improved version achieved a win rate of 81.65% against the trained version without additional features.			arxiv	['Jr-Chang Chen', 'I-Chen Wu', 'Tinghan Wei']	132.0

The infinitely extended chess-board-like patterns correspond to the continuous spectrum bands of the NLSE theory. More complicated patterns can be observed when the initial condition contains several localised periodic swells.

381	A billiards-like dynamical system for attacking chess pieces	Christopher R. H. Hanusa	2019-01-07 16:56:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01917v2	We apply a one-dimensional discrete dynamical system originally considered by Arnol'd reminiscent of mathematical billiards to the study of two-move riders, a type of fairy chess piece. In this model, particles travel through a bounded convex region along line segments of one of two fixed slopes. We apply this dynamical system to characterize the vertices of the inside-out polytope arising from counting placements of nonattacking chess pieces and also to give a bound for the period of the counting quasipolynomial. The analysis focuses on points of the region that are on trajectories that contain a corner or on cycles of full rank, or are crossing points thereof. As a consequence, we give a simple proof that the period of the bishops' counting quasipolynomial is 2, and provide formulas bounding periods of counting quasipolynomials for many two-move riders including all partial nightriders. We draw parallels to the theory of mathematical billiards and pose many new open questions.			arxiv	['Arvind V. Mahankali']	134.0
382	Memory and long-range correlations in chess games	Ana L. Schaigorodsky	2013-07-02 15:30:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0729v3	In this paper we report the existence of long-range memory in the opening moves of a chronologically ordered set of chess games using an extensive chess database. We used two mapping rules to build discrete time series and analyzed them using two methods for detecting long-range correlations; rescaled range analysis and detrented fluctuation analysis. We found that long-range memory is related to the level of the players. When the database is filtered according to player levels we found differences in the persistence of the different subsets. For high level players, correlations are stronger at long time scales; whereas in intermediate and low level players they reach the maximum value at shorter time scales. This can be interpreted as a signature of the different strategies used by players with different levels of expertise. These results are robust against the assignation rules and the method employed in the analysis of the time series.			arxiv	['Juan I. Perotti', 'Orlando V. Billoni']	135.0

Our results show that using an appropriate mentor, we can evolve a program that is on par with top tournament-playing chess programs, outperforming a two-time World Computer Chess Champion. This performance gain is achieved by evolving a program with a smaller number of parameters in its evaluation function to mimic the behavior of a superior mentor which uses a more extensive evaluation function. In principle, our mentor-assisted approach could be used in a wide range of problems for which appropriate mentors are available.			arxiv	['Moshe Koppel', 'Nathan S. Netanyahu']	136.0

This is achieved by combining supervised and unsupervised learning. In the supervised learning phase the organisms are evolved to mimic the behavior of human grandmasters, and in the unsupervised learning phase these evolved organisms are further improved upon by means of coevolution. While past attempts succeeded in creating a grandmaster-level program by mimicking the behavior of existing computer chess programs, this paper presents the first successful attempt at evolving a state-of-the-art evaluation function by learning only from databases of games played by humans. Our results demonstrate that the evolved program outperforms a two-time World Computer Chess Champion.			arxiv	['H. Jaap van den Herik', 'Moshe Koppel', 'Nathan S. Netanyahu']	137.0

We deduce this by converting the problem to one of counting lattice points outside an affinographic hyperplane arrangement, which Forge and Zaslavsky solved by means of weighted integral gain graphs. We extend their work by developing both generating functions and a detailed analysis of deletion and contraction for weighted integral gain graphs. For chess pieces we find the asymptotic probability that a random configuration is nonattacking, and we obtain exact counts of nonattacking configurations of small numbers of queens, bishops, knights, and nightriders.			arxiv	['Christopher R.

386	Search in Imperfect Information Games	Martin Schmid	2021-11-10 19:06:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05884v1	From the very dawn of the field, search with value functions was a fundamental concept of computer games research. Turing's chess algorithm from 1950 was able to think two moves ahead, and Shannon's work on chess from $1950$ includes an extensive section on evaluation functions to be used within a search. Samuel's checkers program from 1959 already combines search and value functions that are learned through self-play and bootstrapping. TD-Gammon improves upon those ideas and uses neural networks to learn those complex value functions -- only to be again used within search. The combination of decision-time search and value functions has been present in the remarkable milestones where computers bested their human counterparts in long standing challenging games -- DeepBlue for Chess and AlphaGo for Go. Until recently, this powerful framework of search aided with (learned) value functions has been limited to perfect information games. As many interesting problems do not provide the agent perfect information of the environment, this was an unfortunate limitation. This thesis introduces the reader to sound search for imperfect information games.			arxiv	[]	139.0
387	Improving Ranking Quality and Fairness in Swiss-System Chess Tournaments	Pascal Sauer	2021-12-20 13:31:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10522v2	The International Chess Federation (FIDE) imposes a voluminous and complex set of player pairing criteria in Swiss-system chess tournaments and endorses computer programs that are able to calculate the prescribed pairings. The purpose of these formalities is to ensure that players are paired fairly during the tournament and that the final ranking corresponds to the players' true strength order. We contest the official FIDE player pairing routine by presenting alternative pairing rules. These can be enforced by computing maximum weight matchings in a carefully designed graph. We demonstrate by extensive experiments that a tournament format using our mechanism 1) yields fairer pairings in the rounds of the tournament and 2) produces a final ranking that reflects the players' true strengths better than the state-of-the-art FIDE pairing system.			arxiv	['√Ågnes Cseh', 'Pascal Lenzner']	140.0
388	Quantifying human performance in chess	Sandeep Chowdhary	2022-07-15 23:13:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07780v1	From sports to science, the recent availability of large-scale data has allowed to gain insights on the drivers of human innovation and success in a variety of domains. Here we quantify human performance in the popular game of chess by leveraging a very large dataset comprising of over 120 million games between almost 1 million players. We find that individuals encounter hot streaks of repeated success, longer for beginners than for expert players, and even longer cold streaks of unsatisfying performance. Skilled players can be distinguished from the others based on their gaming behaviour. Differences appear from the very first moves of the game, with experts tending to specialize and repeat the same openings while beginners explore and diversify more. However, experts experience a broader response repertoire, and display a deeper understanding of different variations within the same line. Over time, the opening diversity of a player tends to decrease, hinting at the development of individual playing styles. Nevertheless, we find that players are often not able to recognize their most successful openings. Overall, our work contributes to quantifying human performance in competitive settings, providing a first large-scale quantitative analysis of individual careers in chess, helping unveil the determinants separating elite from beginner performance.			arxiv	['Iacopo Iacopini', 'Federico Battiston']	141.0

Language models, can help gain insight into a variety of interesting problems such as unsupervised learning rules of a game, detecting player behavior patterns, player attribution, and ultimately learning the game to beat state of the art. In this study, we applied BERT models, first to the simple Nim game to analyze its performance in the presence of noise in a setup of a few-shot learning architecture. We analyzed the model performance via three virtual players, namely Nim Guru, Random player, and Q-learner. In the second part, we applied the game learning language model to the chess game, and a large set of grandmaster games with exhaustive encyclopedia openings. Finally, we have shown that model practically learns the rules of the chess game and can survive games against Stockfish at a category-A rating level.			arxiv	['Erhan Guven']	142.0
390	On the Smoothness and Regularity of the Chess Billiard Flow and the Poincar√© Problem	Sally Zhu	2022-10-12 23:18:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13384v1	The Poincar\'e problem is a model of two-dimensional internal waves in stable-stratified fluid. The chess billiard flow, a variation of a typical billiard flow, drives the formation behind and describes the evolution of these internal waves, and its trajectories can be represented as rotations around the boundary of a given domain. We find that for sufficiently irrational rotation in the square, or when the rotation number $r(\lambda)$ is Diophantine, the regularity of the solution $u(t)$ of the evolution problem correlates directly to the regularity of the forcing function $f(x)$. Additionally, we show that when $f$ is smooth, then $u$ is also smooth. These results extend studies that have examined singularity points, or the lack of regularity, in rational rotations of the chess billiard flow. We also present numerical simulations in various geometries that analyze plateau formation and fractal dimension in $r(\lambda)$ and conjecture an extension of our results. Our results can be applied in modeling two dimensional oceanic waves, and they also relate the classical quantum correspondence to fluid study.			arxiv	['Zhenhao Li']	143.0

Ismail	2023-02-27 16:40:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13937v3	"In this note, I introduce a new framework called n-person games with partial knowledge, in which players have only limited knowledge about the aspects of the game -- including actions, outcomes, and other players. For example, playing an actual game of chess is a game of partial knowledge. To analyze these games, I introduce a set of new concepts and mechanisms for measuring the intelligence of players, with a focus on the interplay between human- and machine-based decision-making. Specifically, I introduce two main concepts: firstly, the Game Intelligence (GI) mechanism, which quantifies a player's demonstrated intelligence in a game by considering not only the game's outcome but also the ""mistakes"" made during the game according to the reference machine's intelligence. Secondly, I define gaming-proofness, a practical and computational concept of strategy-proofness. The GI mechanism provides a practicable way to assess players and can potentially be applied to a wide range of games, from chess and backgammon to AI systems. To illustrate the GI mechanism, I apply it to an extensive dataset comprising over a million moves made by top chess Grandmasters."			arxiv	[]	144.0

This paper probes the performance of ChatGPT, a sophisticated language model by OpenAI in tackling such complex reasoning tasks, using chess as a case study. Through robust metrics examining both the legality and quality of moves, we assess ChatGPT's understanding of the chessboard, adherence to chess rules, and strategic decision-making abilities. Our evaluation identifies limitations within ChatGPT's attention mechanism that affect its formal language comprehension and uncovers the model's underdeveloped self-regulation abilities. Our study also reveals ChatGPT's propensity for a coherent strategy in its gameplay and a noticeable uptick in decision-making assertiveness when the model is presented with a greater volume of natural language or possesses a more lucid understanding of the state of the chessboard. These findings contribute to the growing exploration of language models' abilities beyond natural language processing, providing valuable information for future research towards models demonstrating human-like cognitive abilities.			arxiv	['Chih-Chung Hsueh', 'Richard Tzong-Han Tsai']	145.0

Ribeiro	2012-12-12 12:02:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2787v1	The complexity of chess matches has attracted broad interest since its invention. This complexity and the availability of large number of recorded matches make chess an ideal model systems for the study of population-level learning of a complex system. We systematically investigate the move-by-move dynamics of the white player's advantage from over seventy thousand high level chess matches spanning over 150 years. We find that the average advantage of the white player is positive and that it has been increasing over time. Currently, the average advantage of the white player is ~0.17 pawns but it is exponentially approaching a value of 0.23 pawns with a characteristic time scale of 67 years. We also study the diffusion of the move dependence of the white player's advantage and find that it is non-Gaussian, has long-ranged anti-correlations and that after an initial period with no diffusion it becomes super-diffusive. We find that the duration of the non-diffusive period, corresponding to the opening stage of a match, is increasing in length and exponentially approaching a value of 15.6 moves with a characteristic time scale of 130 years. We interpret these two trends as a resulting from learning of the features of the game. Additionally, we find that the exponent {\alpha} characterizing the super-diffusive regime is increasing toward a value of 1.9, close to the ballistic regime. We suggest that this trend is due to the increased broadening of the range of abilities of chess players participating in major tournaments.			arxiv	['R. S. Mendes', 'E. K.

394	Aligning Superhuman AI with Human Behavior: Chess as a Model System	Reid McIlroy-Young	2020-06-02 18:12:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01855v3	As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly intelligent---in some cases, achieving superhuman performance---there is growing potential for humans to learn from and collaborate with algorithms. However, the ways in which AI systems approach problems are often different from the ways people do, and thus may be uninterpretable and hard to learn from. A crucial step in bridging this gap between human and artificial intelligence is modeling the granular actions that constitute human behavior, rather than simply matching aggregate human performance. We pursue this goal in a model system with a long history in artificial intelligence: chess. The aggregate performance of a chess player unfolds as they make decisions over the course of a game. The hundreds of millions of games played online by players at every skill level form a rich source of data in which these decisions, and their exact context, are recorded in minute detail. Applying existing chess engines to this data, including an open-source implementation of AlphaZero, we find that they do not predict human moves well. We develop and introduce Maia, a customized version of Alpha-Zero trained on human chess games, that predicts human moves at a much higher accuracy than existing engines, and can achieve maximum accuracy when predicting decisions made by players at a specific skill level in a tuneable way. For a dual task of predicting whether a human will make a large mistake on the next move, we develop a deep neural network that significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Taken together, our results suggest that there is substantial promise in designing artificial intelligence systems with human collaboration in mind by first accurately modeling granular human decision-making.			arxiv	['Siddhartha Sen', 'Jon Kleinberg', 'Ashton Anderson']	147.0
395	Statistical analysis of chess games: space control and tipping points	Marc Barthelemy	2023-04-22 14:54:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11425v2	Moves in chess games are usually analyzed on a case-by-case basis by professional players, but thanks to the availability of large game databases, we can envision another approach of the game. Here, we indeed adopt a very different point of view, and analyze moves in chess games from a statistical point of view. We first focus on spatial properties and the location of pieces and show that the number of possible moves during a game is positively correlated with its outcome. We then study heatmaps of pieces and show that the spatial distribution of pieces varies less between human players than with engines (such as Stockfish): engines seem to use pieces in a very different way as human did for centuries. These heatmaps also allow us to construct a distance between players that characterizes how they use their pieces. In a second part, we focus on the best move and the second best move found by Stockfish and study the difference $\Delta$ of their evaluation. We found different regimes during a chess game. In a `quiet' regime, $\Delta$ is small, indicating that many paths are possible for both players. In contrast, there are also `volatile' regimes characterized by a `tipping point', for which $\Delta$ becomes large. At these tipping points, the outcome could then switch completely depending on the move chosen. We also found that for a large number of games, the distribution of $\Delta$ can be fitted by a power law $P(\Delta)\sim \Delta^{-\beta}$ with an exponent that seems to be universal (for human players and engines) and around $\beta\approx 1.8$. The probability to encounter a tipping point in a game is therefore far from being negligible. Finally, we conclude by mentioning possible directions of research for a quantitative understanding of chess games such as the structure of the pawn chain, the interaction graph between pieces, or a quantitative definition of critical points.			arxiv	[]	148.0
396	The CHESS chemical Herschel surveys of star forming regions: Peering into the protostellar shock L1157-B1. I. Shock chemical complexity	C. Codella	2010-06-09 17:42:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1864v1	We present the first results of the unbiased survey of the L1157-B1 bow shock, obtained with HIFI in the framework of the key program Chemical Herschel surveys of star forming regions (CHESS). The L1157 outflow is driven by a low-mass Class 0 protostar and is considered the prototype of the so-called chemically active outflows. The bright blue-shifted bow shock B1 is the ideal laboratory for studying the link between the hot (around 1000-2000 K) component traced by H2 IR-emission and the cold (around 10-20 K) swept-up material. The main aim is to trace the warm gas chemically enriched by the passage of a shock and to infer the excitation conditions in L1157-B1. A total of 27 lines are identified in the 555-636 GHz region, down to an average 3 sigma level of 30 mK. The emission is dominated by CO(5-4) and H2O(110-101) transitions, as discussed by Lefloch et al. (2010). Here we report on the identification of lines from NH3, H2CO, CH3OH, CS, HCN, and HCO+. The comparison between the profiles produced by molecules released from dust mantles (NH3, H2CO, CH3OH) and that of H2O is consistent with a scenario in which water is also formed in the gas-phase in high-temperature regions where sputtering or grain-grain collisions are not efficient. The high excitation range of the observed tracers allows us to infer, for the first time for these species, the existence of a warm (> 200 K) gas component coexisting in the B1 bow structure with the cold and hot gas detected from ground.			arxiv	['B.

397	A Discrete Evolutionary Model for Chess Players' Ratings	Trevor Fenner	2011-03-08 13:51:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1530v2	The Elo system for rating chess players, also used in other games and sports, was adopted by the World Chess Federation over four decades ago. Although not without controversy, it is accepted as generally reliable and provides a method for assessing players' strengths and ranking them in official tournaments. It is generally accepted that the distribution of players' rating data is approximately normal but, to date, no stochastic model of how the distribution might have arisen has been proposed. We propose such an evolutionary stochastic model, which models the arrival of players into the rating pool, the games they play against each other, and how the results of these games affect their ratings. Using a continuous approximation to the discrete model, we derive the distribution for players' ratings at time $t$ as a normal distribution, where the variance increases in time as a logarithmic function of $t$. We validate the model using published rating data from 2007 to 2010, showing that the parameters obtained from the data can be recovered through simulations of the stochastic model. The distribution of players' ratings is only approximately normal and has been shown to have a small negative skew. We show how to modify our evolutionary stochastic model to take this skewness into account, and we validate the modified model using the published official rating data.			arxiv	['Mark Levene', 'George Loizou']	150.0
398	On religion and language evolutions seen through mathematical and agent based models	M. Ausloos	2011-03-28 14:52:16	http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5382v1	(shortened version) Religions and languages are social variables, like age, sex, wealth or political opinions, to be studied like any other organizational parameter. In fact, religiosity is one of the most important sociological aspects of populations. Languages are also a characteristics of the human kind. New religions, new languages appear though others disappear. All religions and languages evolve when they adapt to the society developments. On the other hand, the number of adherents of a given religion, the number of persons speaking a language is not fixed. Several questions can be raised. E.g. from a macroscopic point of view : How many religions/languages exist at a given time? What is their distribution? What is their life time? How do they evolve?. From a microscopic view point: can one invent agent based models to describe macroscopic aspects? Does it exist simple evolution equations? It is intuitively accepted, but also found through from statistical analysis of the frequency distribution that an attachment process is the primary cause of the distribution evolution : usually the initial religion/language is that of the mother. Later on, changes can occur either due to heterogeneous agent interaction processes or due to external field constraints, - or both. Such cases can be illustrated with historical facts and data. It is stressed that characteristic time scales are different, and recalled that external fields are very relevant in the case of religions, rending the study more interesting within a mechanistic approach			arxiv	[]	151.0
399	A More Human Way to Play Computer Chess	Kieran Greer	2015-03-14 18:47:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04333v5	This paper suggests a forward-pruning technique for computer chess that uses 'Move Tables', which are like Transposition Tables, but for moves not positions. They use an efficient memory structure and has put the design into the context of long and short-term memories. The long-term memory updates a play path with weight reinforcement, while the short-term memory can be immediately added or removed. With this, 'long branches' can play a short path, before returning to a full search at the resulting leaf nodes. Re-using an earlier search path allows the tree to be forward-pruned, which is known to be dangerous, because it removes part of the search process. Additional checks are therefore made and moves can even be re-added when the search result is unsatisfactory. Automatic feature analysis is now central to the algorithm, where key squares and related squares can be generated automatically and used to guide the search process. Using this analysis, if a search result is inferior, it can re-insert un-played moves that cover these key squares only. On the tactical side, a type of move that the forward-pruning will fail on is recognised and a pattern-based solution to that problem is suggested. This has completed the theory of an earlier paper and resulted in a more human-like approach to searching for a chess move. Tests demonstrate that the obvious blunders associated with forward pruning are no longer present and that it can compete at the top level with regard to playing strength.			arxiv	[]	152.0
400	On the ranking of a Swiss system chess team tournament	L√°szl√≥ Csat√≥	2015-07-08 11:44:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05045v5	The paper suggests a family of paired comparison-based scoring procedures for ranking the participants of a Swiss system chess team tournament. We present the challenges of ranking in Swiss system, the features of individual and team competitions as well as the failures of the official rankings based on lexicographical order. The tournament is represented as a ranking problem such that the linearly-solvable row sum (score), generalized row sum, and least squares methods have favourable axiomatic properties. Two chess team European championships are analysed as case studies. Final rankings are compared by their distances and visualized with multidimensional scaling (MDS). Differences to the official ranking are revealed by the decomposition of the least squares method. Rankings are evaluated by prediction power, retrodictive performance, and stability. The paper argues for the use of least squares method with a results matrix favouring match points on the basis of its relative insensitivity to the choice between match and board points, retrodictive accuracy, and robustness.			arxiv	[]	153.0
401	Assessing Human Error Against a Benchmark of Perfection	Ashton Anderson	2016-06-15 20:00:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04956v1	An increasing number of domains are providing us with detailed trace data on human decisions in settings where we can evaluate the quality of these decisions via an algorithm. Motivated by this development, an emerging line of work has begun to consider whether we can characterize and predict the kinds of decisions where people are likely to make errors. To investigate what a general framework for human error prediction might look like, we focus on a model system with a rich history in the behavioral sciences: the decisions made by chess players as they select moves in a game. We carry out our analysis at a large scale, employing datasets with several million recorded games, and using chess tablebases to acquire a form of ground truth for a subset of chess positions that have been completely solved by computers but remain challenging even for the best players in the world. We organize our analysis around three categories of features that we argue are present in most settings where the analysis of human error is applicable: the skill of the decision-maker, the time available to make the decision, and the inherent difficulty of the decision. We identify rich structure in all three of these categories of features, and find strong evidence that in our domain, features describing the inherent difficulty of an instance are significantly more powerful than features based on skill or time.			arxiv	['Jon Kleinberg', 'Sendhil Mullainathan']	154.0
402	On the Complexity of Reconnaissance Blind Chess	Jared Markowitz	2018-11-07 19:20:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03119v2	This paper provides a complexity analysis for the game of reconnaissance blind chess (RBC), a recently-introduced variant of chess where each player does not know the positions of the opponent's pieces a priori but may reveal a subset of them through chosen, private sensing actions. In contrast to many commonly studied imperfect information games like poker, an RBC player does not know what the opponent knows or has chosen to learn, exponentially expanding the size of the game's information sets (i.e., the number of possible game states that are consistent with what a player has observed). Effective RBC sensing and moving strategies must account for the uncertainty of both players, an essential element of many real-world decision-making problems. Here we evaluate RBC from a game theoretic perspective, tracking the proliferation of information sets from the perspective of selected canonical bot players in tournament play. We show that, even for effective sensing strategies, the game sizes of RBC compare to those of Go while the average size of a player's information set throughout an RBC game is much greater than that of a player in Heads-up Limit Hold 'Em. We compare these measures of complexity among different playing algorithms and provide cursory assessments of the various sensing and moving strategies.			arxiv	['Ryan W. Gardner', 'Ashley J.

403	Multimodal Observation and Interpretation of Subjects Engaged in Problem Solving	Thomas Guntz	2017-10-12 12:59:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04486v1	In this paper we present the first results of a pilot experiment in the capture and interpretation of multimodal signals of human experts engaged in solving challenging chess problems. Our goal is to investigate the extent to which observations of eye-gaze, posture, emotion and other physiological signals can be used to model the cognitive state of subjects, and to explore the integration of multiple sensor modalities to improve the reliability of detection of human displays of awareness and emotion. We observed chess players engaged in problems of increasing difficulty while recording their behavior. Such recordings can be used to estimate a participant's awareness of the current situation and to predict ability to respond effectively to challenging situations. Results show that a multimodal approach is more accurate than a unimodal one. By combining body posture, visual attention and emotion, the multimodal approach can reach up to 93% of accuracy when determining player's chess expertise while unimodal approach reaches 86%. Finally this experiment validates the use of our equipment as a general and reproducible tool for the study of participants engaged in screen-based interaction and/or problem solving.			arxiv	['Raffaella Balzarini', 'Dominique Vaufreydaz', 'James L.

404	Mastering Atari, Go, Chess and Shogi by Planning with a Learned Model	Julian Schrittwieser	2019-11-19 13:58:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265v2	Constructing agents with planning capabilities has long been one of the main challenges in the pursuit of artificial intelligence. Tree-based planning methods have enjoyed huge success in challenging domains, such as chess and Go, where a perfect simulator is available. However, in real-world problems the dynamics governing the environment are often complex and unknown. In this work we present the MuZero algorithm which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics. MuZero learns a model that, when applied iteratively, predicts the quantities most directly relevant to planning: the reward, the action-selection policy, and the value function. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games - the canonical video game environment for testing AI techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled - our new algorithm achieved a new state of the art. When evaluated on Go, chess and shogi, without any knowledge of the game rules, MuZero matched the superhuman performance of the AlphaZero algorithm that was supplied with the game rules.			arxiv	['Ioannis Antonoglou', 'Thomas Hubert', 'Karen Simonyan', 'Laurent Sifre', 'Simon Schmitt', 'Arthur Guez', 'Edward Lockhart', 'Demis Hassabis', 'Thore Graepel', 'Timothy Lillicrap', 'David Silver']	157.0
405	Detecting Individual Decision-Making Style: Exploring Behavioral Stylometry in Chess	Reid McIlroy-Young	2022-08-02 11:18:16	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01366v1	The advent of machine learning models that surpass human decision-making ability in complex domains has initiated a movement towards building AI systems that interact with humans. Many building blocks are essential for this activity, with a central one being the algorithmic characterization of human behavior. While much of the existing work focuses on aggregate human behavior, an important long-range goal is to develop behavioral models that specialize to individual people and can differentiate among them. To formalize this process, we study the problem of behavioral stylometry, in which the task is to identify a decision-maker from their decisions alone. We present a transformer-based approach to behavioral stylometry in the context of chess, where one attempts to identify the player who played a set of games. Our method operates in a few-shot classification framework, and can correctly identify a player from among thousands of candidate players with 98% accuracy given only 100 labeled games. Even when trained on amateur play, our method generalises to out-of-distribution samples of Grandmaster players, despite the dramatic differences between amateur and world-class players. Finally, we consider more broadly what our resulting embeddings reveal about human style in chess, as well as the potential ethical implications of powerful methods for identifying individuals from behavioral data.			arxiv	['Russell Wang', 'Siddhartha Sen', 'Jon Kleinberg', 'Ashton Anderson']	158.0
406	ChessGPT: Bridging Policy Learning and Language Modeling	Xidong Feng	2023-06-15 15:35:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09200v2	When solving decision-making tasks, humans typically depend on information from two key sources: (1) Historical policy data, which provides interaction replay from the environment, and (2) Analytical insights in natural language form, exposing the invaluable thought process or strategic considerations. Despite this, the majority of preceding research focuses on only one source: they either use historical replay exclusively to directly learn policy or value functions, or engaged in language model training utilizing mere language corpus. In this paper, we argue that a powerful autonomous agent should cover both sources. Thus, we propose ChessGPT, a GPT model bridging policy learning and language modeling by integrating data from these two sources in Chess games. Specifically, we build a large-scale game and language dataset related to chess. Leveraging the dataset, we showcase two model examples ChessCLIP and ChessGPT, integrating policy learning and language modeling. Finally, we propose a full evaluation framework for evaluating language model's chess ability. Experimental results validate our model and dataset's effectiveness. We open source our code, model, and dataset at https://github.com/waterhorse1/ChessGPT.			arxiv	['Yicheng Luo', 'Ziyan Wang', 'Hongrui Tang', 'Mengyue Yang', 'Kun Shao', 'David Mguni', 'Yali Du', 'Jun Wang']	159.0
407	Bridging the Human-AI Knowledge Gap: Concept Discovery and Transfer in AlphaZero	Lisa Schut	2023-10-25 06:49:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16410v1	Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have made remarkable progress, attaining super-human performance across various domains. This presents us with an opportunity to further human knowledge and improve human expert performance by leveraging the hidden knowledge encoded within these highly performant AI systems. Yet, this knowledge is often hard to extract, and may be hard to understand or learn from. Here, we show that this is possible by proposing a new method that allows us to extract new chess concepts in AlphaZero, an AI system that mastered the game of chess via self-play without human supervision. Our analysis indicates that AlphaZero may encode knowledge that extends beyond the existing human knowledge, but knowledge that is ultimately not beyond human grasp, and can be successfully learned from. In a human study, we show that these concepts are learnable by top human experts, as four top chess grandmasters show improvements in solving the presented concept prototype positions. This marks an important first milestone in advancing the frontier of human knowledge by leveraging AI; a development that could bear profound implications and help us shape how we interact with AI systems across many AI applications.			arxiv	['Nenad Tomasev', 'Tom McGrath', 'Demis Hassabis', 'Ulrich Paquet', 'Been Kim']	160.0

CHESS is a far ultraviolet (FUV) rocket-borne instrument designed to study the atomic-to-molecular transitions within translucent cloud regions in the interstellar medium (ISM). CHESS is an objective f/12.4 echelle spectrograph with resolving power $>$ 100,000 over the band pass 1000 $-$ 1600 {\AA}. The spectrograph was designed to employ an R2 echelle grating with ""low"" line density. We compare the FUV performance of experimental echelle etching processes (lithographically by LightSmyth, Inc. and etching via electron-beam technology by JPL Microdevices Laboratory) with traditional, mechanically-ruled gratings (Bach Research, Inc. and Richardson Gratings). The cross-dispersing grating, developed and ruled by Horiba Jobin-Yvon, is a holographically-ruled, ""low"" line density, powered optic with a toroidal surface curvature. Both gratings were coated with aluminum and lithium fluoride (Al+LiF) at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Results from final efficiency and reflectivity measurements for the optical components of CHESS-2 are presented. CHESS-2 utilizes a 40mm-diameter cross-strip anode readout microchannel plate (MCP) detector fabricated by Sensor Sciences, Inc., to achieve high spatial resolution with high count rate capabilities (global rates $>$ 1 MHz). We present pre-flight laboratory spectra and calibration results. CHESS-2 launched on 21 February 2016 aboard NASA/CU sounding rocket mission 36.297 UG.

Although starting from zero knowledge has been shown to yield impressive results, it is associated with high computationally costs especially for complex games. With this paper, we present CrazyAra which is a neural network based engine solely trained in supervised manner for the chess variant crazyhouse. Crazyhouse is a game with a higher branching factor than chess and there is only limited data of lower quality available compared to AlphaGo. Therefore, we focus on improving efficiency in multiple aspects while relying on low computational resources. These improvements include modifications in the neural network design and training configuration, the introduction of a data normalization step and a more sample efficient Monte-Carlo tree search which has a lower chance to blunder. After training on 569,537 human games for 1.5 days we achieve a move prediction accuracy of 60.4%. During development, versions of CrazyAra played professional human players. Most notably, CrazyAra achieved a four to one win over 2017 crazyhouse world champion Justin Tan (aka LM Jann Lee) who is more than 400 Elo higher rated compared to the average player in our training set. Furthermore, we test the playing strength of CrazyAra on CPU against all participants of the second Crazyhouse Computer Championships 2017, winning against twelve of the thirteen participants. Finally, for CrazyAraFish we continue training our model on generated engine games. In ten long-time control matches playing Stockfish 10, CrazyAraFish wins three games and draws one out of ten matches.			arxiv	['Moritz Willig', 'Alena Beyer', 'Kristian Kersting', 'Johannes F√ºrnkranz']	166.0

It has become popular in recent years, and has served as a useful platform for both game-theoretic study and AI games research. Buro showed that simple Amazons endgames are NP-equivalent, leaving the complexity of the general case as an open problem. We settle this problem, by showing that deciding the outcome of an n x n Amazons position is PSPACE-hard. We give a reduction from one of the PSPACE-complete two-player formula games described by Schaefer. Since the number of moves in an Amazons game is polynomially bounded (unlike Chess and Go), Amazons is in PSPACE. It is thus on a par with other two-player, bounded-move, perfect-information games such as Hex, Othello, and Kayles. Our construction also provides an alternate proof that simple Amazons endgames are NP-equivalent. Our reduction uses a number of amazons polynomial in the input formula length; a remaining open problem is the complexity of Amazons when only a constant number of amazons is used.			arxiv	[]	170.0

The automorphism group of $X$ is isomorphic to $S_4\times S_3$. We prove that the triangulation $X$ is the minimal by the number of vertices triangulation of $\CP^2$ admitting a chess colouring of four-dimensional simplices. We provide explicit parametrizations for simplices of $X$ and show that the automorphism group of $X$ can be realized as a group of isometries of the Fubini--Study metric. We provide a 33-vertex subdivision $\bX$ of the triangulation $X$ such that the classical moment mapping $\mu:\CP^2\to\Delta^2$ is a simplicial mapping of the triangulation $\bX$ onto the barycentric subdivision of the triangle $\Delta^2$. We study the relationship of the triangulation $X$ with complex crystallographic groups.			arxiv	[]	171.0

A mathematical model of the partial depth scheme is outlined and a formula for the partial depth added for each ply is calculated from the principles of the model. An implementation of alpha-beta with partial depth is given. The method is tested using an experimental strategy having as objective to show the effect of allocation of a higher amount of search resources on areas of the search tree with higher information. The search proceeds in the direction of lines with higher information gain. The effects on search performance of allocating higher search resources on lines with higher information gain are tested experimentaly and conclusive results are obtained. In order to isolate the effects of the partial depth scheme no other heuristic is used.			arxiv	[]	172.0
420	Dynamic Move Chains -- a Forward Pruning Approach to Tree Search in Computer Chess	Kieran Greer	2014-03-04 13:07:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0778v1	This paper proposes a new mechanism for pruning a search game-tree in computer chess. The algorithm stores and then reuses chains or sequences of moves, built up from previous searches. These move sequences have a built-in forward-pruning mechanism that can radically reduce the search space. A typical search process might retrieve a move from a Transposition Table, where the decision of what move to retrieve would be based on the position itself. This algorithm stores move sequences based on what previous sequences were better, or caused cutoffs. This is therefore position independent and so it could also be useful in games with imperfect information or uncertainty, where the whole situation is not known at any one time. Over a small set of tests, the algorithm was shown to clearly out-perform Transposition Tables, both in terms of search reduction and game-play results.			arxiv	[]	173.0

The corresponding directed graph has only one directed cycle and only five terminal positions. It remains open: (i) if the number $n$ of the players can be reduced from $4$ to $3$, (ii) if the number $p$ of the terminals can be reduced from $5$ to $4$, and most important, (iii) whether it is possible to get a similar example in which the outcome $c$ corresponding to all (possibly, more than one) directed cycles is worse than every terminal for each player. Yet, it is known that (j) $n$ cannot be reduced to $2$, (jj) $p$ cannot be reduced to $3$, and (jjj) there can be no similar example in which each player makes a decision in a unique position.

It can compress the introduction or description of a person or another named entity into a terse, poignant formulation and can best be explained by an example: When Norwegian world champion Magnus Carlsen is described as ""the Mozart of chess"", it is Vossian Antonomasia we are dealing with. The pattern is simple: A source (Mozart) is used to describe a target (Magnus Carlsen), the transfer of meaning is reached via a modifier (""of chess""). This phenomenon has been discussed before (as 'metaphorical antonomasia' or, with special focus on the source object, as 'paragons'), but no corpus-based approach has been undertaken as yet to explore its breadth and variety. We are looking into a full-text newspaper corpus (The New York Times, 1987-2007) and describe a new method for the automatic extraction of Vossian Antonomasia based on Wikidata entities. Our analysis offers new insights into the occurrence of popular paragons and their distribution."			arxiv	['Robert J√§schke']	177.0

Voice recordings were taken from 50 people (23 men and 27 women). While recording the sound, 29 words from each person were used which are determined as necessary for playing the game. Mel Frequency Coefficients (MFCC) and Gammatone Cepstral Coefficients (GTCC) qualification methods were used. In addition, k-NN, Naive Bayes and Neural Network classification methods were used for classification. Two different classification procedures were applied, namely, person-based and general. While the performance rate in person-based classification ranged from 75% to 98%, a performance over 84% was achieved in general classification.			arxiv	['Yakup Kutlu']	178.0
426	Maharaja Nim, Wythoff's Queen meets the Knight	Urban Larsson	2012-07-03 17:49:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0765v1	New combinatorial games are introduced, of which the most pertinent is Maharaja Nim. The rules extend those of the well-known impartial game of Wythoff Nim in which two players take turn in moving a single Queen of Chess on a large board, attempting to be the first to put her in the lower left corner. Here, in addition to the classical rules a player may also move the Queen as the Knight of Chess moves. We prove that the second player's winning positions of Maharaja Nim are close to the ones of Wythoff Nim, namely they are within a bounded distance to the lines with slope $\frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$ respectively. For a close relative to Maharaja Nim, where the Knight's jumps are of the form $(2,3)$ and $(3,2)$ (rather than $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$), we also demonstrate polynomial time complexity to the decision problem of the outcome of a given position.			arxiv	['Johan W√§stlund']	179.0
427	Learning Self-Game-Play Agents for Combinatorial Optimization Problems	Ruiyang Xu	2019-03-08 21:38:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03674v2	Recent progress in reinforcement learning (RL) using self-game-play has shown remarkable performance on several board games (e.g., Chess and Go) as well as video games (e.g., Atari games and Dota2). It is plausible to consider that RL, starting from zero knowledge, might be able to gradually approximate a winning strategy after a certain amount of training. In this paper, we explore neural Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search (neural MCTS), an RL algorithm which has been applied successfully by DeepMind to play Go and Chess at a super-human level. We try to leverage the computational power of neural MCTS to solve a class of combinatorial optimization problems. Following the idea of Hintikka's Game-Theoretical Semantics, we propose the Zermelo Gamification (ZG) to transform specific combinatorial optimization problems into Zermelo games whose winning strategies correspond to the solutions of the original optimization problem. The ZG also provides a specially designed neural MCTS. We use a combinatorial planning problem for which the ground-truth policy is efficiently computable to demonstrate that ZG is promising.			arxiv	['Karl Lieberherr']	180.0

This can be attributed to the fact that we do not experience quantum mechanics on a tangible level in our daily lives. Games can provide an environment in which people can experience the strange behavior of the quantum world in a fun and mentally engaging way. Games could also offer an interesting test bed for near term quantum devices because they can be tailored to support varying amounts of quantum behavior through simple rule changes, which can be useful when dealing with limited resources. This paper explores the design of a variant of Chess which is built on top of unitary dynamics and includes non-trivial quantum effects such as superposition, entanglement, and interference. A movement ruleset is introduced which allows players to create superposition, entanglement, and interference effects. A measurement rule is also introduced which helps limit the size of the superposition, so the game remains tractable for a classical computer, and also helps make the game more comprehensible for a player.			arxiv	[]	181.0
429	Decisions and Performance Under Bounded Rationality: A Computational Benchmarking Approach	Dainis Zegners	2020-05-26 11:39:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12638v2	This paper presents a novel approach to analyze human decision-making that involves comparing the behavior of professional chess players relative to a computational benchmark of cognitively bounded rationality. This benchmark is constructed using algorithms of modern chess engines and allows investigating behavior at the level of individual move-by-move observations, thus representing a natural benchmark for computationally bounded optimization. The analysis delivers novel insights by isolating deviations from this benchmark of bounded rationality as well as their causes and consequences for performance. The findings document the existence of several distinct dimensions of behavioral deviations, which are related to asymmetric positional evaluation in terms of losses and gains, time pressure, fatigue, and complexity. The results also document that deviations from the benchmark do not necessarily entail worse performance. Faster decisions are associated with more frequent deviations from the benchmark, yet they are also associated with better performance. The findings are consistent with an important influence of intuition and experience, thereby shedding new light on the recent debate about computational rationality in cognitive processes.			arxiv	['Uwe Sunde', 'Anthony Strittmatter']	182.0
430	When Rooks Miss: Probability through Chess	Steven J. Miller	2021-05-10 14:24:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04398v1	A famous (and hard) chess problem asks what is the maximum number of safe squares possible in placing $n$ queens on an $n\times n$ board. We examine related problems from placing $n$ rooks. We prove that as $n\to\infty$, the probability rapidly tends to 1 that the fraction of safe squares from a random placement converges to $1/e^2$. Our interest in the problem is showing how to view the involved algebra to obtain the simple, closed form limiting fraction. In particular, we see the power of many of the key concepts in probability: binary indicator variables, linearity of expectation, variances and covariances, Chebyshev's inequality, and Stirling's formula.			arxiv	['Haoyu Sheng', 'Daniel Turek']	183.0
431	An Upper Bound on the State-Space Complexity of Brandubh	Kiernan Compy	2021-06-09 19:37:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05353v1	Before chess came to Northern Europe there was Tafl, a family of asymmetric strategy board games associated strongly with the Vikings. The purpose of this paper is to study the combinatorial state-space complexity of an Irish variation of Tafl called Brandubh. Brandubh was chosen because of its asymmetric goals for the two players, but also its overall complexity well below that of chess, which should make it tractable for strong solving. Brandubh's rules and characteristics are used to gain an understanding of the overall state-space complexity of the game. State-spaces will consider valid piece positions, a generalized rule set, and accepted final state conditions. From these states the upper bound for the complexity of strongly solving Brandubh is derived. Great effort has been placed on thoroughly accounting for all potential states and excluding invalid ones for the game. Overall, the upper bound complexity for solving the game is around 10^14 states, between that of connect four and draughts (checkers).			arxiv	['Alana Evey', 'Hunter McCullough', 'Lindsay Allen', 'Aaron S.

Move-by-move data provide exceptionally detailed and precise information about decision times and decision quality, based on a comparison of actual decisions to a computational benchmark of best moves constructed using the artificial intelligence of a chess engine. The results reveal that faster decisions are associated with better performance. The findings are consistent with the predictions of procedural decision models like drift-diffusion-models in which decision makers sequentially acquire information about decision alternatives with uncertain valuations.			arxiv	['Dainis Zegners', 'Anthony Strittmatter']	186.0

We gathered games of professional Shogi players from 1968 to 2019. The major findings are: (1) diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) reduces innate ability, which reduces the performance gap among same-age players; (2) players winning rates declined consistently from 20 years and as they get older; (3) AI accelerated the ageing declination of the probability of winning, which increased the performance gap among different aged players; (4) the effects of AI on the ageing declination and the probability of winning are observed for high innate skill players but not for low innate skill ones. This implies that the diffusion of AI hastens players retirement from active play, especially for those with high innate abilities. Thus, AI is a substitute for innate ability in brain-work productivity.			arxiv	['Ryohei Hayashi']	187.0
435	Word Play for Playing Othello (Reverses)	Samantha E. Miller Noever	2022-07-18 17:13:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08766v1	Language models like OpenAI's Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT-2/3) capture the long-term correlations needed to generate text in a variety of domains (such as language translators) and recently in gameplay (chess, Go, and checkers). The present research applies both the larger (GPT-3) and smaller (GPT-2) language models to explore the complex strategies for the game of Othello (or Reverses). Given the game rules for rapid reversals of fortune, the language model not only represents a candidate predictor of the next move based on previous game moves but also avoids sparse rewards in gameplay. The language model automatically captures or emulates championship-level strategies. The fine-tuned GPT-2 model generates Othello games ranging from 13-71% completion, while the larger GPT-3 model reaches 41% of a complete game. Like previous work with chess and Go, these language models offer a novel way to generate plausible game archives, particularly for comparing opening moves across a larger sample than humanly possible to explore. A primary contribution of these models magnifies (by two-fold) the previous record for player archives (120,000 human games over 45 years from 1977-2022), thus supplying the research community with more diverse and original strategies for sampling with other reinforcement learning techniques.			arxiv	['David Noever']	188.0
436	Supervised and Reinforcement Learning from Observations in Reconnaissance Blind Chess	Timo Bertram	2022-08-03 12:50:19	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02029v1	In this work, we adapt a training approach inspired by the original AlphaGo system to play the imperfect information game of Reconnaissance Blind Chess. Using only the observations instead of a full description of the game state, we first train a supervised agent on publicly available game records. Next, we increase the performance of the agent through self-play with the on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm Proximal Policy Optimization. We do not use any search to avoid problems caused by the partial observability of game states and only use the policy network to generate moves when playing. With this approach, we achieve an ELO of 1330 on the RBC leaderboard, which places our agent at position 27 at the time of this writing. We see that self-play significantly improves performance and that the agent plays acceptably well without search and without making assumptions about the true game state.			arxiv	['Johannes F√ºrnkranz', 'Martin M√ºller']	189.0

Landau called this ""relative Wertbemessung"", which translates to relative score. The basic idea from linear algebra behind this scoring system was rediscovered and reused in many contexts since 1895; in particular, it is a central ingredient in Google's PageRank."			arxiv	['G√ºnter M.

The main challenge associated with self-learned agents in the form of deep neural networks, is their black-box nature: it is impossible for humans to interpret deep neural networks. Therefore, humans cannot directly interpret the actions of deep neural network based agents, or foresee their robustness in different scenarios. In this work, we demonstrate a method for probing which concepts self-learning agents internalise in the course of their training. For demonstration, we use a chess playing agent in a fast and light environment developed specifically to be suitable for research groups without access to enormous computational resources or machine learning models.			arxiv	['Inga Str√ºmke']	191.0
439	The Swiss Gambit	√Ågnes Cseh	2023-02-21 10:56:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10595v1	In each round of a Swiss-system tournament, players of similar score are paired against each other. An intentional early loss therefore might lead to weaker opponents in later rounds and thus to a better final tournament result - a phenomenon known as the Swiss Gambit. To the best of our knowledge it is an open question whether this strategy can actually work. This paper provides answers based on an empirical agent-based analysis for the most prominent application area of the Swiss-system format, namely chess tournaments. We simulate realistic tournaments by employing the official FIDE pairing system for computing the player pairings in each round. We show that even though gambits are widely possible in Swiss-system chess tournaments, profiting from them requires a high degree of predictability of match results. Moreover, even if a Swiss Gambit succeeds, the obtained improvement in the final ranking is limited. Our experiments prove that counting on a Swiss Gambit is indeed a lot more of a risky gambit than a reliable strategy to improve the final rank.			arxiv	['Pascal F√ºhrlich', 'Pascal Lenzner']	192.0

441	Chess-board Acoustic Crystals with Momentum-space Nonsymmorphic Symmetries	Yanqiu Wang	2023-05-11 23:11:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07174v1	Spatial symmetries appearing in both real and momentum space are of fundamental significance to crystals. However, in the conventional framework, every space group in real space, either symmorphic or nonsymmorphic, corresponds to a symmorphic dual in momentum space. Our experiment breaks the framework by showing that in a 2D acoustic crystal with chess-board pattern of $\pi$ and 0 fluxes, mirror reflections are manifested nonsymmorphically as glide reflections in momentum space. These momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries stem from projective, rather than ordinary, representations of the real-space symmetries due to the peculiar flux pattern. Moreover, our experiment demonstrates that the glide reflection can reduce the topological type of the Brillouin zone from the torus to the Klein bottle, resulting in novel topological phases with new topological invariants. Since crystalline topologies are based on momentum-space symmetries, our work paves the way for utilizing engineerable gauge fluxes over artificial crystals to extend the current topological classifications into the broader regime of momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries.			arxiv	['Chen Zhang', 'Z.

Theoretical models of aging predict hazard curves that monotonically increase in time, in discrepancy with the peculiar ups and downs observed in empirically. Here we introduce the concept of co-aging, where the demographic trajectories of multiple cohorts couple together, and show that co-aging dynamics can account for the anomalous hazard curves exhibited by some species. In our model, multiple interdependency networks inflict damage on one other proportional to their number of functional nodes. We then fit our model predictions to three datasets describing (1) co-aging worm-pathogen populations (2) competing tree species. Lastly, we gather the mortality statistics of (3) machine-against-machine chess games to demonstrate that co-aging dynamics is not exclusive to biological systems.			arxiv	['Dervis C. Vural']	195.0

Ismail	2023-12-20 01:47:55	http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12700v1	In this note, I introduce Estimated Performance Rating (PR$^e$), a novel system for evaluating player performance in sports and games. PR$^e$ addresses a key limitation of the Tournament Performance Rating (TPR) system, which is undefined for zero or perfect scores in a series of games. PR$^e$ is defined as the rating that solves an optimization problem related to scoring probability, making it applicable for any performance level. The main theorem establishes that the PR$^e$ of a player is equivalent to the TPR whenever the latter is defined. I then apply this system to historically significant win-streaks in association football, tennis, and chess. Beyond sports, PR$^e$ has broad applicability in domains where Elo ratings are used, from college rankings to the evaluation of large language models.			arxiv	[]	196.0

Making use of the full HIFI spectrum of OMC-2 FIR 4 obtained in CHESS, we detected several ground-state lines from OH+, H2O+, HF, and CH+, all of them seen in absorption against the dust continuum emission of the protostar's envelope. The lines peak at a velocity of 9 km/s, which is blue-shifted by 2 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity of OMC-2 FIR 4 (V = 11.4 km/s). We derived column densities for each species, as well as an upper limit to the column density of the undetected H3O+. In order to model and characterise the foreground cloud, we used the Meudon PDR code to run a homogeneous grid of models that spans a reasonable range of densities, visual extinctions, cosmic ray ionisation rates and far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation fields. The results of our modelling indicate that the foreground cloud is composed of predominantly neutral diffuse gas (n(H) = 100 cm-3) and is heavily irradiated by an external source of FUV that most likely arises from the nearby Trapezium OB association. The cloud is 6 pc thick and bears many similarities with the so-called C+ interface between Orion-KL and the Trapezium cluster, 2 pc south of OMC-2 FIR 4. We conclude that the foreground cloud we detected is an extension of the C+ interface seen in the direction of Orion KL, and interpret it to be the remains of the parental cloud of OMC-1, which extends from OMC-1 up to OMC-2.			arxiv	['Mihkel Kama', 'Cecilia Ceccarelli', 'Carsten Dominik', 'Emmanuel Caux', 'Asunci√≥n Fuente', 'Tom√°s Alonso-Albi']	197.0
445	Learning Models of Individual Behavior in Chess	Reid McIlroy-Young	2020-08-23 18:24:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10086v3	AI systems that can capture human-like behavior are becoming increasingly useful in situations where humans may want to learn from these systems, collaborate with them, or engage with them as partners for an extended duration. In order to develop human-oriented AI systems, the problem of predicting human actions -- as opposed to predicting optimal actions -- has received considerable attention. Existing work has focused on capturing human behavior in an aggregate sense, which potentially limits the benefit any particular individual could gain from interaction with these systems. We extend this line of work by developing highly accurate predictive models of individual human behavior in chess. Chess is a rich domain for exploring human-AI interaction because it combines a unique set of properties: AI systems achieved superhuman performance many years ago, and yet humans still interact with them closely, both as opponents and as preparation tools, and there is an enormous corpus of recorded data on individual player games. Starting with Maia, an open-source version of AlphaZero trained on a population of human players, we demonstrate that we can significantly improve prediction accuracy of a particular player's moves by applying a series of fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, our personalized models can be used to perform stylometry -- predicting who made a given set of moves -- indicating that they capture human decision-making at an individual level. Our work demonstrates a way to bring AI systems into better alignment with the behavior of individual people, which could lead to large improvements in human-AI interaction.			arxiv	['Russell Wang', 'Siddhartha Sen', 'Jon Kleinberg', 'Ashton Anderson']	198.0

Recently, Interaction Networks (INs) were proposed for the task of modeling multi-agent physical systems, INs scale with the number of interactions in the system (typically quadratic or higher order in the number of agents). In this paper we introduce VAIN, a novel attentional architecture for multi-agent predictive modeling that scales linearly with the number of agents. We show that VAIN is effective for multi-agent predictive modeling. Our method is evaluated on tasks from challenging multi-agent prediction domains: chess and soccer, and outperforms competing multi-agent approaches.			arxiv	[]	207.0

We extend this approach to imperfect information games and present ExIt-OOS, a novel approach to playing imperfect information games within the Expert Iteration framework and inspired by AlphaZero. We use Online Outcome Sampling, an online search algorithm for imperfect information games in place of MCTS. While training online, our neural strategy is used to improve the accuracy of playouts in OOS, allowing a learning and planning feedback loop for imperfect information games.			arxiv	['Michela Benedetti']	208.0

We consider both symmetric and partisan games, and explore differences between discrete bidding games and Richman games, which allow real-valued bidding. Unlike Richman games, discrete bidding game variations of many familiar games, such as chess, Connect Four, and even Tic-Tac-Toe, are suitable for recreational play. We also present an analysis of Tic-Tac-Toe for both discrete and real-valued bidding.			arxiv	['Sam Payne']	209.0

We show that in general, RBG is currently the fastest GGP system. For example, for chess, we demonstrate that RBG is about 37 times faster than Ludii, and Ludii is about 3 times slower than a GDL propnet. Referring to the recent comparison [An Empirical Evaluation of Two General Game Systems: Ludii and RBG, CoG 2019], we show evidences that the benchmark presented there contains a number of significant flaws that lead to wrong conclusions.			arxiv	['Maksymilian Mika', 'Jakub Sutowicz', 'Marek Szyku≈Ça']	211.0

Previous research has developed parallel versions of MCTS, exploiting today's multiprocessing architectures. These studies focused on versions of MCTS for the discrete case. Our work builds upon existing parallelization strategies and extends them to continuous domains. In particular, leaf parallelization and root parallelization are studied and two final selection strategies that are required to handle continuous states in root parallelization are proposed. The evaluation of the resulting parallelized continuous MCTS is conducted using a challenging cooperative multi-agent system trajectory planning task in the domain of automated vehicles.			arxiv	['Christoph H√∂rtnagl', 'J.

During this thesis, a library was developed which provides a set of useful functions using the selection monad to compute optimal games and AIs for sequential games. In order to explore the selection monads ability to support these AI implementations, three example case studies were developed using Haskell: The two-player game Connect Four, a Sudoku solver and a simplified version of Chess. These case studies show how to elegantly implement a game AI. Furthermore, a performance analysis of these case studies was done, identifying the major points where performance can be increased.			arxiv	[]	213.0

We motivated and applied a SOTA actor-critic method Proximal Policy Optimization with Generalized Advantage Estimation. Our initial task centered around training the agent against a random agent. Once we obtained reasonable performance, we then adopted a version of iterative policy improvement adopted by AlphaGo to pit the agent against increasingly stronger versions of itself, and evaluate the resulting performance gain. The final agent achieves a near (.97) perfect win rate against a random agent. We also explore the effects of pretraining the network using a collection of positions obtained via self-play.			arxiv	['Robert Tan']	214.0

A win rewards a player with 1 points, a draw with 1/2 point, and a loss with 0 points. We are interested in the distribution of the scores associated with ranks of $n$ players after ${\displaystyle {n \choose 2}}$ games, i.e. the distribution of the maximal score, second maximum, and so on. The exact distribution for a general $n$ seems impossible to obtain; we obtain a limit distribution.			arxiv	[]	215.0

Unlike a monolithic approach, the hydrodynamics and electromagnetic field are handled by separate solvers, all developed within the Center for Hypersonics and Entry Systems Studies (CHESS) at the University of Illinois. Hydrodynamics is modeled using HEGEL , a finite volume solver for non-equilibrium plasmas. This solver is interfaced with the PLATO library, which is responsible for evaluating all plasma-related quantities (e.g., thermodynamic and transport properties). The electric field is handled by FLUX , a finite element solver. Coupling is realized using the PRE CICE open-source library. Applications are here presented and discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling strategy.			arxiv	['Sanjeev Kumar', 'Marco Panesi']	219.0
467	Solving Abalone on Small Boards	Joseph Gutstadt	2023-08-06 20:54:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03208v1	Abalone is a 2-player board game with perfect information. The game is played on a 5x5x5 hexagonal grid and ends when a player pushes 6 of their opponents' pieces off the board. Abalone is similar to games like chess and Go in that all three games have high branching factors, making it difficult for a computer to determine the outcome of a game. However, solving smaller, simplified versions of Abalone can offer insight into how to play the full-size game optimally. In this paper, we strongly solve a variation of Abalone played on a 2x2x2 hexagonal board. We also weakly solve an Abalone variation on a 2x2x3 hexagonal board.			arxiv	['Kirsten Hogenson', 'John Koerner']	220.0

470	Upper limit for the D2H+ ortho-to-para ratio in the prestellar core 16293E (CHESS)	C. Vastel	2012-10-02 15:23:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0804v2	The H3+ ion plays a key role in the chemistry of dense interstellar gas clouds where stars and planets are forming. The low temperatures and high extinctions of such clouds make direct observations of H3+ impossible, but lead to large abundances of H2D+ and D2H+, which are very useful probes of the early stages of star and planet formation. The ground-state rotational ortho-D2H+ 111-000 transition at 1476.6 GHz in the prestellar core 16293E has been searched for with the Herschel/HIFI instrument, within the CHESS (Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions) Key Program. The line has not been detected at the 21 mK km/s level (3 sigma integrated line intensity). We used the ortho-H2D+ 110-111 transition and para-D2H+ 110-101 transition detected in this source to determine an upper limit on the ortho-to-para D2H+ ratio as well as the para-D2H+/ortho-H2D+ ratio from a non-LTE analysis. The comparison between our chemical modeling and the observations suggests that the CO depletion must be high (larger than 100), with a density between 5e5 and 1e6 cm-3. Also the upper limit on the ortho-D2H+ line is consistent with a low gas temperature (~ 11 K) with a ortho-to-para ratio of 6 to 9, i.e. 2 to 3 times higher than the value estimated from the chemical modeling, making it impossible to detect this high frequency transition with the present state of the art receivers.			arxiv	['P.

471	How Relevant Are Chess Composition Conventions?	Azlan Iqbal	2013-09-12 06:00:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3039v2	Composition conventions are guidelines used by human composers in composing chess problems. They are particularly significant in composition tournaments. Examples include, not having any check in the first move of the solution and not dressing up the board with unnecessary pieces. Conventions are often associated or even directly conflated with the overall aesthetics or beauty of a composition. Using an existing experimentally-validated computational aesthetics model for three-move mate problems, we analyzed sets of computer-generated compositions adhering to at least 2, 3 and 4 comparable conventions to test if simply conforming to more conventions had a positive effect on their aesthetics, as is generally believed by human composers. We found slight but statistically significant evidence that it does, but only to a point. We also analyzed human judge scores of 145 three-move mate problems composed by humans to see if they had any positive correlation with the computational aesthetic scores of those problems. We found that they did not. These seemingly conflicting findings suggest two main things. First, the right amount of adherence to composition conventions in a composition has a positive effect on its perceived aesthetics. Second, human judges either do not look at the same conventions related to aesthetics in the model used or emphasize others that have less to do with beauty as perceived by the majority of players, even though they may mistakenly consider their judgements beautiful in the traditional, non-esoteric sense. Human judges may also be relying significantly on personal tastes as we found no correlation between their individual scores either.			arxiv	[]	224.0

In this article, we give very simple always winning strategies for the first player if n is 4 or odd. The additionally (in the source package) provided computer program QPGAME3 has been used to check that there are successful strategies for the first player if n is 6 or 8, and for the second player if n is 10, 12, 14, or 16.

473	A New Paradigm for Minimax Search	Aske Plaat	2014-04-05 20:05:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1515v1	This paper introduces a new paradigm for minimax game-tree search algo- rithms. MT is a memory-enhanced version of Pearls Test procedure. By changing the way MT is called, a number of best-first game-tree search algorithms can be simply and elegantly constructed (including SSS*). Most of the assessments of minimax search algorithms have been based on simulations. However, these simulations generally do not address two of the key ingredients of high performance game-playing programs: iterative deepening and memory usage. This paper presents experimental data from three game-playing programs (checkers, Othello and chess), covering the range from low to high branching factor. The improved move ordering due to iterative deepening and memory usage results in significantly different results from those portrayed in the literature. Whereas some simulations show Alpha-Beta expanding almost 100% more leaf nodes than other algorithms [12], our results showed variations of less than 20%. One new instance of our framework (MTD-f) out-performs our best alpha- beta searcher (aspiration NegaScout) on leaf nodes, total nodes and execution time. To our knowledge, these are the first reported results that compare both depth-first and best-first algorithms given the same amount of memory			arxiv	['Jonathan Schaeffer', 'Wim Pijls', 'Arie de Bruin']	226.0

As part of the CHESS (Chemical Herschel Survey of Star Forming Regions) Key Programme, AFGL 2591 was observed by the Herschel/HIFI instrument. The spectral survey covered a frequency range from 480 up to 1240 GHz as well as single lines from 1267 to 1901 GHz (i.e. CO, HCl, NH3, OH and [CII]). Rotational and population diagram methods were used to calculate column densities, excitation temperatures and the emission extents of the observed molecules associated with AFGL 2591. The analysis was supplemented with several lines from ground-based JCMT spectra. From the HIFI spectral survey analysis a total of 32 species were identified (including isotopologues). In spite of the fact that lines are mostly quite week, 268 emission and 16 absorption lines were found (excluding blends). Molecular column densities range from 6e11 to 1e19 cm-2 and excitation temperatures range from 19 to 175 K. One can distinguish cold (e.g. HCN, H2S, NH3 with temperatures below 70 K) and warm species (e.g. CH3OH, SO2) in the protostellar envelope.			arxiv	['F. F. S. van der Tak', 'F. P. Helmich', 'L.

The placement strategies adopted by Weiqi players are often used to analog the philosophy of human wars. Contrary to the western chess, Weiqi games are less studied by academics partially because Weiqi is popular only in East Asia, especially in China, Japan and Korea. Here, we propose to construct a directed tree using a database of extensive Weiqi games and perform a quantitative analysis of the Weiqi tree. We find that the popularity distribution of Weiqi openings with a same number of moves is distributed according to a power law and the tail exponent increases with the number of moves. Intriguingly, the superposition of the popularity distributions of Weiqi openings with the number of moves no more than a given number also has a power-law tail in which the tail exponent increases with the number of moves, and the superposed distribution approaches to the Zipf law. These findings are the same as for chess and support the conjecture that the popularity distribution of board game openings follows the Zipf law with a universal exponent. We also find that the distribution of out-degrees has a power-law form, the distribution of branching ratios has a very complicated pattern, and the distribution of uniqueness scores defined by the path lengths from the root vertex to the leaf vertices exhibits a unimodal shape. Our work provides a promising direction for the study of the decision making process of Weiqi playing from the angle of directed branching tree.			arxiv	['Ming-Xia Li', 'Wei-Xing Zhou']	228.0

Caravaca	2016-10-06 17:53:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02029v3	The ability to separately identify the Cherenkov and scintillation light components produced in scintillating mediums holds the potential for a major breakthrough in neutrino detection technology, allowing development of a large, low-threshold, directional detector with a broad physics program. The CHESS (CHErenkov / Scintillation Separation) experiment employs an innovative detector design with an array of small, fast photomultiplier tubes and state-of-the-art electronics to demonstrate the reconstruction of a Cherenkov ring in a scintillating medium based on photon hit time and detected photoelectron density. This paper describes the physical properties and calibration of CHESS along with first results. The ability to reconstruct Cherenkov rings is demonstrated in a water target, and a time precision of 338 +/- 12 ps FWHM is achieved. Monte Carlo based predictions for the ring imaging sensitivity with a liquid scintillator target predict an efficiency for identifying Cherenkov hits of 94 +/- 1% and 81 +/- 1% in pure linear alkyl benzene (LAB) and LAB loaded with 2 g/L of PPO, respectively, with a scintillation contamination of 12 +/- 1% and 26 +/- 1%.			arxiv	['F.

The method involves mechanical geometry as well as an optimized deployment algorithm. The geometry is found to be simple for mechanical implementation. The algorithm initially assigns the IFUs to the target objects and then devises the movement sequence based on the current and the desired IFU positions. The reconfiguration time using the suitable actuators which runs at 20 cm/s is found to be a maximum of 25 seconds for the circular DOTIFS focal plane (180 mm diameter). The Geometry Algorithm Combination (GAC) has been tested on several million mock target configurations with object-to-IFU ({\tau} ) ratio varying from 0.25 to 16. The MRC method is found to-be efficient in target acquisition in terms of field revisit and deployment time without any collision or entanglement of the fiber bundles. The efficiency of the technique does not get affected by the increase in number density of target objects. The technique is compared with other available methods based on sky coverage, flexibility and overhead time. The proposed geometry and algorithm combination is found to have an advantage in all of the aspects.			arxiv	['A. N.

If these models could be shown to accurately reflect the underlying beliefs of the human beings that produced the data used to train these models, then such models become a powerful sociological tool in ways that are distinct from traditional methods, such as interviews and surveys. In this study, We train a version of the GPT-2 on a corpora of historical chess games, and then ""launch"" clusters of synthetic agents into the model, using text strings to create context and orientation. We compare the trajectories contained in the text generated by the agents/model and compare that to the known ground truth of the chess board, move legality, and historical patterns of play. We find that the percentages of moves by piece using the model are substantially similar from human patterns. We further find that the model creates an accurate latent representation of the chessboard, and that it is possible to plot trajectories of legal moves across the board using this knowledge."			arxiv	['Antonio Bucchiarone']	231.0

In particular, this relates to software that have to do with chess, certain chess variants and possibly even similar board games with comparable position representation. Even when performance may be equal or inferior to using arrays, the algorithm still provides an accurate and viable alternative to accomplishing the same thing, or when there may be a need for additional or side processing in conjunction with arrays. Furthermore, the end result (i.e. an updated FEN string) is immediately ready for export to any other internal module or external program, unlike with an intermediary array which needs to be first converted into a FEN string for export purposes. The algorithm is especially useful when there are no existing array-based modules to represent a visual board as it can do without them entirely. We provide examples that demonstrate the correctness of the algorithm given a variety of positions involving castling, en passant and pawn promotion.			arxiv	[]	232.0

Recently Reinforcement Learning algorithms for hedging under realistic market conditions have attracted significant interest. While research in the derivatives area mostly focused on variations of $Q$-learning, in artificial intelligence Monte Carlo Tree Search is the recognized state-of-the-art method for various planning problems, such as the games of Hex, Chess, Go,... This article introduces Monte Carlo Tree Search as a method to solve the stochastic optimal control problem behind the pricing and hedging tasks. As compared to $Q$-learning it combines Reinforcement Learning with tree search techniques. As a consequence Monte Carlo Tree Search has higher sample efficiency, is less prone to over-fitting to specific market models and generally learns stronger policies faster. In our experiments we find that Monte Carlo Tree Search, being the world-champion in games like Chess and Go, is easily capable of maximizing the utility of investor's terminal wealth without setting up an auxiliary mathematical framework.			arxiv	[]	233.0
481	On Evaluating Self-Adaptive and Self-Healing Systems using Chaos Engineering	Moeen Ali Naqvi	2022-08-28 14:38:57	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13227v1	With the growing adoption of self-adaptive systems in various domains, there is an increasing need for strategies to assess their correct behavior. In particular self-healing systems, which aim to provide resilience and fault-tolerance, often deal with unanticipated failures in critical and highly dynamic environments. Their reactive and complex behavior makes it challenging to assess if these systems execute according to the desired goals. Recently, several studies have expressed concern about the lack of systematic evaluation methods for self-healing behavior. In this paper, we propose CHESS, an approach for the systematic evaluation of self-adaptive and self-healing systems that builds on chaos engineering. Chaos engineering is a methodology for subjecting a system to unexpected conditions and scenarios. It has shown great promise in helping developers build resilient microservice architectures and cyber-physical systems. CHESS turns this idea around by using chaos engineering to evaluate how well a self-healing system can withstand such perturbations. We investigate the viability of this approach through an exploratory study on a self-healing smart office environment. The study helps us explore the promises and limitations of the approach, as well as identify directions where additional work is needed. We conclude with a summary of lessons learned.			arxiv	['Sehrish Malik', 'Merve Astekin', 'Leon Moonen']	234.0
482	Evaluating Superhuman Models with Consistency Checks	Lukas Fluri	2023-06-16 17:26:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09983v3	If machine learning models were to achieve superhuman abilities at various reasoning or decision-making tasks, how would we go about evaluating such models, given that humans would necessarily be poor proxies for ground truth? In this paper, we propose a framework for evaluating superhuman models via consistency checks. Our premise is that while the correctness of superhuman decisions may be impossible to evaluate, we can still surface mistakes if the model's decisions fail to satisfy certain logical, human-interpretable rules. We instantiate our framework on three tasks where correctness of decisions is hard to evaluate due to either superhuman model abilities, or to otherwise missing ground truth: evaluating chess positions, forecasting future events, and making legal judgments. We show that regardless of a model's (possibly superhuman) performance on these tasks, we can discover logical inconsistencies in decision making. For example: a chess engine assigning opposing valuations to semantically identical boards; GPT-4 forecasting that sports records will evolve non-monotonically over time; or an AI judge assigning bail to a defendant only after we add a felony to their criminal record.			arxiv	['Daniel Paleka', 'Florian Tram√®r']	235.0
483	Is mathematics a game?	Klaas Landsman	2023-11-21 09:41:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12478v1	"We re-examine the old question to what extent mathematics may be compared to a game. Under the spell of Wittgenstein, we propose that the more refined object of comparison is a ""motley of language games"", the nature of which was (implicitly) clarified by Hilbert: via different language games, axiomatization lies at the basis of both the rigour and the applicability of mathematics. In the ""formalist"" game, mathematics resembles chess via a clear conceptual dictionary. Accepting this resemblance: like positions in chess, mathematical sentences cannot be true or false; true statements in mathematics are about sentences, namely that they are theorems (if they are). In principle, the certainty of mathematics resides in proofs, but to this end, in practice these must be ""surveyable"". Hilbert and Wittgenstein proposed almost oppositie criteria for surveyability; we try to overcome their difference by invoking computer-verified proofs. The ""applied""' language game is based on Hilbert's axiomatization program for physics (and other scientific disciplines), refined by Wittgenstein's idea that theorems are yardsticks to which empirical phenomena may be compared, and further improved by invoking elements of van Fraassen's constructive empiricism. From this perspective, in an appendix we also briefly review the varying roles and structures of axioms, definitions, and proofs in mathematics. Our view is not meant as a philosophy of mathematics by itself, but as a coat rack analogous to category theory, onto which various (traditional and new) philosophies of mathematics (such as formalism, intuitionism, structuralism, deductivism, and the philosophy of mathematical practice) may be attached and may even peacefully support each other."			arxiv	['Kirti Singh']	236.0
484	The ChaMP Extended Stellar Survey (ChESS): Photometric and Spectroscopic Properties of Serendipitously Detected Stellar X-ray Sources	K. R. Covey	2008-05-16 20:17:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2615v1	We present 348 X-ray emitting stars identified from correlating the Extended Chandra Multiwavelength Project (ChaMP), a serendipitous wide-area X-ray survey, with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We use morphological star/galaxy separation, an SDSS quasar catalog, an optical color-magnitude cut, and X-ray data quality tests to create our catalog, the ChaMP Extended Stellar Survey (ChESS), from a sample of 2121 matched ChaMP/SDSS sources. Our cuts retain 92% of the spectroscopically confirmed stars while excluding 99.6% of the 684 spectoscopically confirmed extragalactic sources. Fewer than 3% of the sources in our final catalog are previously identified stellar X-ray emitters; we expect ~10% of the catalog is composed by giants, and identify seven giant stars and three cataclysmic variables. We derive distances, X-ray and bolometric luminosities for these stars, revealing that this catalog fills the gap between the nearby stars identified by the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and the more distant stars detected in deep Chandra and XMM-Newton surveys. For 36 newly identified X-ray emitting M stars we calculate L_(Halpha)/L_(bol). L_(H\alpha)/L_(bol) and L_(X)/L_(bol) are linearly related below L_(X)/L_(bol) ~ 3 x 10^(-4), while L_(Halpha)/L_(bol) appears to turn over at larger L_(X)/L_(bol) values. Stars with reliable SDSS photometry have an ~0.1 mag blue excess in (u-g), likely due to increased chromospheric continuum emission. Photometric metallicity estimates suggest the sample is split between the young and old disk populations of the Galaxy; the lowest activity sources belong to the old disk population, a clear signature of the decay of magnetic activity with age. Future papers will present analyses of source variability and comparisons of this catalog to models of stellar activity in the Galactic disk.			arxiv	['M. A. Agueros', 'P. J. Green', 'D.

485	The CHESS survey of the L1157-B1 shock: the dissociative jet shock as revealed by Herschel--PACS	Milena Benedettini	2012-02-07 15:58:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1451v1	"Outflows generated by protostars heavily affect the kinematics and chemistry of the hosting molecular cloud through strong shocks that enhance the abundance of some molecules. L1157 is the prototype of chemically active outflows, and a strong shock, called B1, is taking place in its blue lobe between the precessing jet and the hosting cloud. We present the Herschel-PACS 55--210 micron spectra of the L1157-B1 shock, showing emission lines from CO, H2O, OH, and [OI]. The spatial resolution of the PACS spectrometer allows us to map the warm gas traced by far-infrared (FIR) lines with unprecedented detail. The rotational diagram of the high-Jup CO lines indicates high-excitation conditions (Tex ~ 210 +/- 10 K). We used a radiative transfer code to model the hot CO gas emission observed with PACS and in the CO (13-12) and (10-9) lines measured by Herschel-HIFI. We derive 200<Tkin<800 K and n>10^5 cm-3. The CO emission comes from a region of about 7 arcsec located at the rear of the bow shock where the [OI] and OH emission also originate. Comparison with shock models shows that the bright [OI] and OH emissions trace a dissociative J-type shock, which is also supported by a previous detection of [FeII] at the same position. The inferred mass-flux is consistent with the ""reverse"" shock where the jet is impacting on the L1157-B1 bow shock. The same shock may contribute significantly to the high-Jup CO emission."			arxiv	['Gemma Busquet', 'Bertrand Lefloch', 'Claudio Codella', 'Silvie Cabrit', 'Cecilia Ceccarelli', 'Teresa Giannini', 'Brunella Nisini', 'Magda Vasta', 'Jose Cernicharo', 'Andrea Lorenzani', 'Anna Maria di Giorgio', 'the CHESS team']	238.0
486	The CHESS survey of the L1157-B1 shock region: CO spectral signatures of jet-driven bowshocks	B. Lefloch	2012-08-20 23:40:04	http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4140v1	The unprecedented sensitivity of Herschel coupled with the high resolution of the HIFI spectrometer permits studies of the intensity-velocity relationship I(v) in molecular outflows, over a higher excitation range than possible up to now. In the course of the CHESS Key Program, we have observed toward the bright bowshock region L1157-B1 the CO rotational transitions between J=5-4 and J=16-15 with HIFI, and the J=1-0, 2-1 and 3-2 with the IRAM-30m and the CSO telescopes. We find that all the line profiles I_{CO}(v) are well fit by a linear combination of three exponential laws exp(-|v/v_0|) with v_0= 12.5, 4.4 and 2.5km/s. The first component dominates the CO emission at J_up > 13, as well as the high-excitation lines of SiO and H2O. The second component dominates for 3 < J_up < 10 and the third one for J_up < 2. We show that these exponentials are the signature of quasi-isothermal shocked gas components: the impact of the jet against the L1157-B1 bowshock (T= 210K), the walls of the outflow cavity associated with B1 (T= 64K) and the older cavity L1157-B2 (T= 23K), respectively. Analysis of the CO line flux in the Large-Velocity Gradient approximation further shows that the emission arises from dense gas (n(H2) > 1e5-1e6 cm-3) close to LTE up to J=20. We find that the CO J=2-1 intensity-velocity relation observed in various other molecular outflows is satisfactorily fit by similar exponential laws, which may hold an important clue to their entrainment process.			arxiv	['S.

487	The Herschel/HIFI spectral survey of OMC-2 FIR 4 (CHESS): An overview of the 480 to 1902 GHz range	M. Kama	2013-05-28 09:17:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6421v1	Broadband spectral surveys of protostars offer a rich view of the physical, chemical and dynamical structure and evolution of star-forming regions. The Herschel Space Observatory opened up the terahertz regime to such surveys, giving access to the fundamental transitions of many hydrides and to the high-energy transitions of many other species. A comparative analysis of the chemical inventories and physical processes and properties of protostars of various masses and evolutionary states is the goal of the Herschel CHEmical Surveys of Star forming regions (CHESS) key program. This paper focusses on the intermediate-mass protostar, OMC-2 FIR 4. We obtained a spectrum of OMC-2 FIR 4 in the 480 to 1902 GHz range with the HIFI spectrometer onboard Herschel and carried out the reduction, line identification, and a broad analysis of the line profile components, excitation, and cooling. We detect 719 spectral lines from 40 species and isotopologs. The line flux is dominated by CO, H2O, and CH3OH. The line profiles are complex and vary with species and upper level energy, but clearly contain signatures from quiescent gas, a broad component likely due to an outflow, and a foreground cloud. We find abundant evidence for warm, dense gas, as well as for an outflow in the field of view. Line flux represents 2% of the 7 L_Sol luminosity detected with HIFI in the 480 to 1250 GHz range. Of the total line flux, 60% is from CO, 13% from H2O and 9% from CH3OH. A comparison with similar HIFI spectra of other sources is set to provide much new insight into star formation regions, a case in point being a difference of two orders of magnitude in the relative contribution of sulphur oxides to the line cooling of Orion KL and OMC-2 FIR 4.			arxiv	['A.

488	Ryuo Nim: A Variant of the classical game of Wythoff Nim	Ryohei Miyadera	2017-11-04 08:03:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01411v1	The authors introduce the impartial game of the generalized Ry\=u\=o Nim, a variant of the classical game of Wythoff Nim. In the latter game, two players take turns in moving a single queen on a large chessboard, attempting to be the first to put her in the upper left corner, position $(0,0)$. Instead of the queen used in Wythoff Nim, we use the generalized Ry\=u\=o for a given natural number $p$. The generalized Ry\=u\=o for $p$ can be moved horizontally and vertically, as far as one wants. It also can be moved diagonally from $(x,y)$ to $(x-s,y-t)$, where $s,t$ are non-negative integers such that $1 \leq s \leq x, 1 \leq t \leq y \textit{and} s+t \leq p-1$. When $p$ is $3$, the generalized Ry\=u\=o for $p$ is a Ry\=u\=o, i.e., a promoted hisha piece of Japanese chess. A Ry\=u\=o combines the power of the rook and the king in Western chess. The generalized Ry\=u\=o Nim for $p$ is mathematically the same as the Nim with two piles of counters in which a player may take any number from either heap, and a player may also simultaneously remove $s$ counters from either of the piles and $t$ counters from the other, where $s+t \leq p-1$ and $p$ is a given natural number. The Grundy number of the generalized Ry\=u\=o Nim for $p$ is given by $\bmod(x+y,p) + p(\lfloor \frac{x}{p} \rfloor \oplus \lfloor \frac{y}{p}\rfloor)$. The authors also study the generalized Ry\=u\=o Nim for $p$ with a pass move. The generalized Ry\=u\=o Nim for $p$ without a pass move has simple formulas for Grundy numbers. This is not the case after the introduction of a pass move, but it still has simple formulas for the previous player's positions. We also study the Ry\=u\=o Nim that restricted the diagonal and side movement. Moreover, we extended the Ry\=u\=o Nim dimension to the $n$-dimension.			arxiv	['Yuki Tokuni', 'Yushi Nakaya', 'Masanori Fukui', 'Tomoaki Abuku', 'Koki Suetsugu']	241.0
489	Revisiting the Temperature of the Diffuse ISM with CHESS Sounding Rocket Observations	Nicholas Kruczek	2019-05-09 17:59:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03781v1	Measuring the temperature and abundance patterns of clouds in the interstellar medium (ISM) provides an observational basis for models of the physical conditions within the clouds, which play an important role in studies of star and planet formation. The Colorado High-resolution Echelle Stellar Spectrograph (CHESS) is a far ultraviolet rocket-borne instrument designed to study the atomic-to-molecular transitions within diffuse molecular and translucent cloud regions. The final two flights of the instrument observed $\beta^{1}$ Scorpii ($\beta$ Sco) and $\gamma$ Arae. We present flight results of interstellar molecular hydrogen (H$_{\rm 2}$) excitation on the sightlines, including measurements of the column densities and temperatures. These results are compared to previous values that were measured using the damping wings of low J$^{\prime \prime}$ H$_{\rm 2}$ absorption features (Savage et al. 1977). For $\beta$ Sco, we find that the derived column density of the J$^{\prime \prime}$ = 1 rotational level differs by a factor of 2-3 when compared to the previous observations. We discuss the discrepancies between the two measurements and show that the source of the difference is due to the opacity of higher rotational levels contributing to the J$^{\prime \prime}$ = 1 absorption wing, increasing the inferred column density in the previous work. We extend this analysis to 9 $Copernicus$ and 13 $FUSE$ spectra to explore the interdependence of the column densities of different rotational levels and how the H$_{\rm 2}$ kinetic temperature is influenced by these relationships. We find a revised average gas kinetic temperature of the diffuse molecular ISM of T$_{01}$ = 68 $\pm$ 13 K, 12% lower than the value found previously.			arxiv	['Kevin France', 'Keri Hoadley', 'Brian Fleming', 'Nicholas Nell']	242.0
490	The reconstruction of Ni and Rh (001) surfaces upon Carbon, Nitrogen, or Oxygen adsorption	Dario Alfe`	1998-12-02 12:23:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9812038v1	Nickel and Rhodium (001) surfaces display a similar - as from STM images - clock reconstruction when half a monolayer of C/Ni, N/Ni or O/Rh is adsorbed; no reconstruction is observed instead for O/Ni. Adsorbate atoms sit at the center of the black squares of a chess-board, $c(2\times 2)$, pattern and two different reconstructions are actually compatible with the observed STM images - showing a $(2\times 2)p4g$ pattern - according to whether a rotation of the black or white squares occurs. We report on a first - principles study of the structure of X/Ni(001) and X/Rh(001) surfaces (X=C,N,O) at half a monolayer coverage, performed using density-functional theory. Our findings are in agreement with all available experimental information and shed new light on the mechanisms responsible for the reconstructions. We show that the same substrate may display different reconstructions - or no reconstruction - upon adsorption of different atomic species, depending on the relative importance of the chemical and steric factors which determine the reconstruction.			arxiv	['Stefano de Gironcoli', 'Stefano Baroni']	243.0
491	Kondo effect in multielectron quantum dots at high magnetic fields	C. Tejedor	2000-03-15 12:00:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0003261v2	We present a general description of low temperature transport through a quantum dot with any number of electrons at filling factor $1<\nu <2$. We provide a general description of a novel Kondo effect which is turned on by application of an appropriate magnetic field. The spin-flip scattering of carriers by the quantum dot only involves two states of the scatterer which may have a large spin. This process is described by spin-flip Hubbard operators, which change the angular momentum, leading to a Kondo Hamiltonian. We obtain antiferromagnetic exchange couplings depending on tunneling amplitudes and correlation effects. Since Kondo temperature has an exponential dependence on exchange couplings, quantitative variations of the parameters in different regimes have important experimental consequences. In particular, we discuss the {\it chess board} aspect of the experimental conductance when represented in a grey scale as a function of both the magnetic field and the gate potential affecting the quantum dot.			arxiv	['L.

Stasyuk	2000-10-22 09:35:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0010334v1	We present the method of the self-consistent calculation of thermodynamical and correlation functions. This approach is based on the GRPA (generalized random phase approximation) scheme with the inclusion of the mean field corrections. Investigation of a pseudospin-electron model (PEM) within the framework of the presented method shows that interaction between the electron and pseudospin subsystems leads to the possibility of either first or second order phase transitions between different uniform phases (bistability) as well as between the uniform and the chess-board ones. In the regime n=const, an instability with respect to phase separation in the electron and pseudospin subsystems can take place.			arxiv	['A. M. Shvaika', 'K. V. Tabunshchyk']	245.0

A conjecture by Richard Stanley says that the sum of the signs of all SYTs with n squares is 2^[n/2]. We present a stronger theorem with a purely combinatorial proof using the Robinson-Schensted correspondence and a new concept called chess tableaux. We also prove a sharpening of another conjecture by Stanley concerning weighted sums of squares of sign-imbalances. The proof is built on a remarkably simple relation between the sign of a permutation and the signs of its RS-corresponding tableaux.			arxiv	[]	246.0
494	Social Learning Methods in Board Games	Vukosi N. Marivate	2008-10-20 07:04:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3474v1	This paper discusses the effects of social learning in training of game playing agents. The training of agents in a social context instead of a self-play environment is investigated. Agents that use the reinforcement learning algorithms are trained in social settings. This mimics the way in which players of board games such as scrabble and chess mentor each other in their clubs. A Round Robin tournament and a modified Swiss tournament setting are used for the training. The agents trained using social settings are compared to self play agents and results indicate that more robust agents emerge from the social training setting. Higher state space games can benefit from such settings as diverse set of agents will have multiple strategies that increase the chances of obtaining more experienced players at the end of training. The Social Learning trained agents exhibit better playing experience than self play agents. The modified Swiss playing style spawns a larger number of better playing agents as the population size increases.			arxiv	['Tshilidzi Marwala']	247.0

This decade the first presumably complete mathematical theory of artificial intelligence based on universal induction-prediction-decision-action has been proposed. This information-theoretic approach solidifies the foundations of inductive inference and artificial intelligence. Getting the foundations right usually marks a significant progress and maturing of a field. The theory provides a gold standard and guidance for researchers working on intelligent algorithms. The roots of universal induction have been laid exactly half-a-century ago and the roots of universal intelligence exactly one decade ago. So it is timely to take stock of what has been achieved and what remains to be done. Since there are already good recent surveys, I describe the state-of-the-art only in passing and refer the reader to the literature. This article concentrates on the open problems in universal induction and its extension to universal intelligence.			arxiv	[]	250.0

An analog integrating pixel array detector with in-pixel storage and temporal resolution of around 150 ns, sufficient to isolate pulses, is presented. Analog integration minimizes count-rate limitations and in-pixel storage captures successive pulses. Fundamental tests of noise and linearity as well as high-speed laser measurements are shown. The detector resolved individual bunch trains at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) at levels of up to 3.7x10^3 x-rays/pixel/train. When applied to turn-by-turn x-ray beam characterization single-shot intensity measurements were made with a repeatability of 0.4% and horizontal oscillations of the positron cloud were detected. This device is appropriate for time-resolved Bragg spot single crystal experiments.			arxiv	['Sol M. Gruner']	252.0

I‚Äôll have to look into it more myself, but I just wanted to put in a little inquiry about black queenside castling against the Spanish.	1.0	t3_18x167l	reddit

For example, I would like to be able to provide the following input parameters: 1. **board size** is 4\*9 <-- irregular shape 2. black has a queen at a1 3. white has a rook at b8 and a knight at c2 4. White's turn And simply get a position for to play. It is almost like a training chess algorithm simulating various end-game scenarios, except that there is no King to worry about... I found many chess algorithms that can be integrated with my project but none of them so far is customizable enough to fit my needs. Currently looking at ChessV which seems promising.

I'm a little confused how people can spend entire minutes not moving, letting a few minutes go between moves. Yet, they beat me with literally less than 1 second left on the clock. Am I missing something, are people so good they can actually waste time down to the millisecond or is that suspicious? I am confused in general by the time wasting on [chess.com](https://chess.com). How can anyone not get through 10 moves in 5 minutes? It's a great troll I guess? Am I impatient, or am I missing something?	2.0	t3_18x5lrx	reddit		
512	Why Ding Liren is the weakest champion of chess history	Unknown	2024-01-03 15:53:54	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18xmkpo/why_ding_liren_is_the_weakest_champion_of_chess/	"I'm not saying Ding Liren is a weak player. He is no doubt one the strongest players of our generation. But, compared to all World Champions that ""reigned"" before him, Ding is no doubt the weakest. Even Kasparov said before the Nepo x Liren match that for the first time in chess history we're going to have a Champion that is not considered the best player of the world. All former Champions at some point were considered the best player of the world. And this is not Liren's case. Only his fans think he is the best. Also, when we see how Liren won his title, it was not impressive. The match had terrible games, with blunders that were criticized by many top level players and even by amateurs players. It looked like they were trying to lose instead of winning. So Ding Liren is a very likable player, very cool and I rooted for him when he played against Nepo but I think that compared to all former champions he is the weakest."	25.0	t3_18xmkpo	reddit

If Caruana wins candidates and gets to play Ding in the world championship later this year, and Ding beats Caruana in the classical portion, winning the match, would you consider Ding to be greater than Magnus? If not, where would you rank him? If he achieves this, Ding would‚Äôve beaten TWO different players who had each won candidates twice, with more experience than when they lost to Magnus. How would this legitimize Ding‚Äôs reign in the world of chess in your eyes? Where does this place Ding in the list of past world champions?	19.0	t3_18xkbif	reddit

As it became my biggest hobby, starting last year, I started playing OTB too. I was doing HORRIBLY, scoring a point out of 9 games, normally that I got out of a bye lol. In a recent rapid tournament, though, I put in my best all-time performance, scoring 3,5/9 points and beating solid 1350s on my way to that result. So much so that I woke up today with my rapid FIDE rating updated to 1290. My parents have nothing to do with chess other than the fact they bring me wherever that tournament is hosted.

Sorry if this breaks the rules‚Ä¶ By now, everyone is aware that quick draws have been plaguing the chess world. Many proposed solutions have been tried, but none have really caught on. I feel like the fix might be simple though. Why not make draws and losses more punishing while keeping the same amount of points for a win? Have a system that rewards +1 for a win, +0 for a draw, and -1 for a loss. This way, a quick draw will net you nothing: no matter how many times you draw, you cannot catch up to someone who earned the win. Thoughts?	10.0	t3_18xdjvs	reddit

539	Adding an opening to your repertoire	Unknown	2024-01-02 10:46:09	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18wmmwu/adding_an_opening_to_your_repertoire/	"Greetings all, I have reached a point in my Chess progression where I am extremely comfortable in a small repertoire of openings, however it seems that I've plateaued with it. I am somewhat versatile with black, however as far as playing with white goes, I play Vienna game exclusively (when Vienna presents itself, I don't try to play it into sicilian or caro). I seem to have a pretty solid grasp of it, essentially always leaving the opening either with advantage or in an equal game. I recently broke above 1500 on chess com and i'm headed towards breaking through 1600. However, with the increasing level of opposition, I find myself way more often within an equal game after the opening, so I've started looking into adding more openings with white. Now here, i'm faced with a dilemma. How do I chose an opening that will fit my playstyle, now that I've found my footing in chess and I have some grasp of mid game / positional chess? As far as my understanding goes, 1.d4 tends to be tailored towards positional players and 1.e4 to a more tactical playstyle, however this doesn't narrow it down that much. Considering Vienna is one of the lighter games in terms of theory, I feel like I'm about to deep dive into chess theory and it feels intimidating sinking hours into an opening that doesn't really suit me (not intuitive, I have hard time grasping the concepts of it). I've already done that once, while I was trying to play KID as black and got a 300 point dip in my rating. So once you are faced with multitude of openings with deep theory, how do you chose? Between Ruy Lopez, Italian, Scotch, 4 knights, how do I get a better grasp of which opening will work better for me? Or I should stick with Vienna for when I feel like playing e4 and try to get better at ""the other half"" and become a d4 player?

However, they all start rightly at move 1, which seems to have a certain disadvantage towards systems in which you do your stuff and, at the end of all the shenaningans, you have your perfect structure, but then you face a myriad of different positions. Is there an opening program that lets you skip all of that and make you see the different positions you'd encounter at, say, move 4? For example, if I get here: 1. d4 e6 2. c4 d6 1. c4 d6 2. d4 e6 they are the same structure, but seen differently in the opening repertoire.	1.0	t3_18wkac2	reddit

549	what is everyone's thoughts on Magnus Carlsen repeatedly being late for games, and then purposefully running down the clock?	Unknown	2024-01-02 23:26:28	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18x3tf6/what_is_everyones_thoughts_on_magnus_carlsen/	Hello chess enjoyers. lately on tik tok i have seen a lot of discussion recently about Magnus Carlsen. naturally this makes sense, he is by far the most popular chess player in the world and so it makes sense that i would hear about him even though i dont really play chess often enough to consider myself a chess fan. however, one thing i have heard about in the grape vine is that not only has Magnus Carlsen been constantly late to his games, but also Purposefully runs down the clock only to show off and win those games in just a few moves. in a specific game that i heard about, it seems like the player Magnus Carlsen was against was rather annoyed by this behavior. a lot of people say this is a tactic of Magnus Carlsen's so that he can get under the opponents skin. and while i agree with that notion. i dont think that is an excuse for displaying what i think is very bad behavior. it's very clear that Magnus Carlsen doesn't really have any respect for his opponents(unless is maybe it's a close friend of his, idk, i dont really know the guy) and while i dont really have any experience in the chess competitive scene, i do play quite a few tabletop games competitively, and i know that in any other game, this kind of behavior would not be tolerated at the table. though i am not an expert on the matter or in chess in general, those are my feelings. feel free to let me know what you think about this. do i have the worst take known to man kind? or is my take rather luke warm? im also genuinely curious what the overall opinion on Magnus Carlsen is right now. P.S. keep in mind that i know Jack Diddily Squat about competitive chess, so my opinions right now are looking from the outside in. i do want to get into competitive chess eventually though.	7.0	t3_18x3tf6	reddit		
550	Nepomniachtch: It Is Unthinkable That Tata Steel And Chennai Masters Are Rewarded Similarly By FIDE	Unknown	2023-12-31 19:52:38	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18vfm12/nepomniachtch_it_is_unthinkable_that_tata_steel/	"Edit: Some people are trying to turn this thread into Gukesh vs Anish / Gukesh deserves it arguments please don't go there. It just happened that these two players were competing for the spot. The discussion is how much harder it is to win an event like Tata Steel or even to be 5th/6th place in Tata Steel than winning this edition of Chennai Masters(or events of similar strength) and how it should be translated into points. Because right now winning Chennai masters twice would giev you 1.5x more points than winning Tata Steel once which is insane, considering Tata Steel is hundreds of times harder to win. IF Fide are going to keep this spot, they really should find a new metric to grade the tournaments. [Nepo in his podcast](https://youtu.be/WB8-RSp8hrQ?t=3075) talked about how non-sense it is to have a tournament that has 8 players in Chennai Masters having a similar weight to Grand Prix points as a ""real"" super tournament like Wijk An Zee He also has a problem with tournament being organized in a hurry instead of half a year ago. He states that Wijk An Zee has 13 rounds with the toughest line up while Chennai Masters have only 7 rounds with a more (in his words - modest) weaker line up. He thinks it is quite unfair that Chennai Masters appeared ""kind of randomly"" (he says Anish wasn't invited but as far as I know Anish was invited. As I said in another comment the timing of invitation really matters whether this was a genuine invite or just a symbolic one) and he claims that the tournament is designed for Gukesh/Arjun to qualify and this happens because money rules the world. Lastly he says that in not so many places in the world you can organize a strong round robin in a week or-two. While starting his thoughts he said ""money rules the world"" so he probably tried to connect these two dots. My own thought is that biggest problem here is having Chennai Masters give a very similar ( I don't know if it is exactly the same) circuit points as Tata Steel Wijk An Zee Included - Anish-Nodirbek-Magnus-Wesley-Fabiano-Parham-Levon-Rapport-Prag-Jorden Van Foorest- Ding Liren- Gukesh - Vincent Keymer and Arjun In this tournament Gukesh became 12th (3rd from the last) and Arjun became 14th(last place) Chennai masters included only one person who was in TOP 20 in live rating list, who is a new top 20 guy in Parham. Rest of lineup is Gukesh-Arjun-Harikrishna- Pavel Eljanov- Aronian- Sjugirov and Predke. Eljanov- Sjugirov-Predke and even Harikrishna would all be prime candidates to be last place if they were playing in Tata Steel so essentially this would be evaluated as a 4 man race in betting odds. Considering participants it really doesn't make sense that winning this tournament can reward even 1/5th of winning Tata Steel . It just so happens that two people who compete for this slot was Gukesh and Anish where Gukesh surpassed Anish with winning Chennai Masters even though Anish won a 100x harder event that really reveals the flaw in point system."	41.0	t3_18vfm12	reddit

Performance Rating really sucks if you play a lot of lower rated players. Artemiev, who gained a decent bit of elo and maintained a rating over 2800 had a blitz performance of around 2755 for the year because he played a couple players under 2000. Firouzja‚Äôs classical performance rating actually went down for the year factoring in the open he played because there were some under 2k players.	12.0	t3_18v3pe8	reddit

This time they catch while he's having a meal. Great one-on-one interview with Sagar Shah being a much better interviewer than most in chess media. Some notes: Sagar asks him why he was relatively emotionless after winning the Blitz this time. Magnus explains that he was just exhausted. Magnus also discusses tournament strategy with distribution of white games and black games etc. Magnus says that he was had good energy, it was sunny outside, and that he was generally feeling good on the last day of the rapid, and that when he feels like that he almost never loses. This sense of semi-invulnerability influenced his play in terms of taking on more complex middle-game positions as he felt he is not taking much of a risk of losing when in that mood. Says his single loss across the two events, against MVL, was unusual in that he had no chance to fight back at all after making a mistake in the opening. Magnus says that he usually looks forward to the blitz more than the rapid as it's more fun but it was quite a grind this time around. Magnus mentions that he didn't sleep that well before the last day of the blitz and that he won through ""sheer will"" rather than brilliant play."	12.0	t3_18uz1px	reddit

584	Help with chess variation	Unknown	2024-01-01 10:24:21	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18vu1uv/help_with_chess_variation/	Hi everyone, For school we‚Äôve got to make a game that has something to do with symmetry. I enjoy chess so I thought maybe I could modify it a bit. And so the rule changes I‚Äôve made for my project are as follows: Instead of a traditional move, pieces can be moved using rotational of mirror symmetry. All pieces can be rotated (tov centre of the board) 90¬∞ or 180¬∞ (anti)clockwise. Square it‚Äôs going to via symmetry must be empty. Bishops: the dark squared bischop can be mirrored in the line between the 4th & 5th rank, the light squared bishop in the line between the e&d file. Rooks: mirror in the longest diagonal that is the same colour as the square it is on. Queen: combine the rules for rook & bischop. Pawns: still capture diagonal, ep still exists, first move is still has option of going 2. same rules as rook for symmetry, but they keep their direction (eg. White pawn rotated +90¬∞, promotion rank is now a file; rotated -180¬∞, promotion rank is now 1st rank). Knights ? King: regular moves, same symmetry rules as Queen - but if in check can only escape using regular moves. I would really appreciate some feedback, for example if I‚Äôve made a piece too overpowered, alternatives or other suggestions are appreciated. And an idea for the knights would also really help me, as I‚Äôm stumped. Thanks in advance, and a merry new year to you all :D	0.0	t3_18vu1uv	reddit

Alternate players are available when a team member is unavailable for a round. Key Details: * Season starts on Monday, January 15th. We assign players to teams one week earlier. * Player ratings typically range from 1100‚Äì2400. * Early registrations get priority for a spot on a team, other players enter the season as alternates/reserve players. * An established Lichess classical rating is required. * Approved applications provide access to our slack workspace where all the league communication takes place. * You can use our [Season 38 kick off arena](https://lichess.org/tournament/4545se38) to get an established rating: [https://lichess.org/tournament/4545se38](https://lichess.org/tournament/4545se38) Learn more [in our FAQ](https://www.lichess4545.com/team4545/document/faq/).	7.0	t3_18v73dq	reddit		
587	Idea for a chess variant: points for checkmates.	Unknown	2024-01-01 08:13:58	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18vsade/idea_for_a_chess_variant_points_for_checkmates/	Looking at Wikipedia, it's clear that there's no shortage of variants - from simple ones to wildly imaginative ones. I want to suggest a simple one. The rules are those of orthodox chess with three additions: * A point system is set. A player gains a single point by checkmating the opponent king. * Once the king has been checkmated, the piece (or, in the case of a double checkmate, both pieces) directly attacking the king will be removed from play. The game continues with the turn moving to the next player. * The game terminates upon reaching stalemate or when both players have insufficient material to create further checkmates. The player with most points wins. If both players have equal points, then it's a tie. The variant has some appeal in that it may happen to be greatly disadvantageous to pounce on opening blunders (e.g., Fool's Mate, Scholar's Mate, etc.) since it seems to be an early trade of the queen for a point (in the instances mentioned), and further accurate play by the opponent may demolish the defensive resources of the player in the middle or endgame, delivering even more checkmates. As such, it may be liberating to try new exotic opening choices which are traditionally very unsound but may be of good strategic value (as reverse-traps, in a sense). Another appeal, in my opinion, is that it builds a deeper appreciation of minor pieces and pawns. Most checkmates and checkmate patterns known by players involve the queen, but knowing the mating construction with a knight and bishop, for example, is highly advantageous since the cost of a point would then be a minor piece. Pawn checkmates are highly prized on similar grounds. Third, I think that it's close enough to orthodox chess that playing it is bound to be highly informative for people who enjoy playing by the regular rules. The emphasis in this variant is not necessarily to achieve checkmate at any one instance, but to think of your position holistically - whether or not your position is good with *continued* play. Thoughts?	2.0	t3_18vsade	reddit

593	The final Women's Candidates spot	Unknown	2023-12-31 14:54:52	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18v9c61/the_final_womens_candidates_spot/	"The final spot for the Women's Candidates tournament is about to be resolved. It's a replacement spot, a spot that was originally up for grabs at the World Cup and became available since Alexandra Goryachkina, who won the World Cup, already qualified through Grand Prix cycle. [Here are the Candidates qualification regulations](https://handbook.fide.com/files/handbook/QualificationForWCT2024.pdf), and below is the part that's in effect (as an aside, note the hastily penciled-in drawing of the lots in only one out of two places where it's needed): > C. 3 spots ‚Äì FIDE Women‚Äôs World Cup 2023 > The players who finish 1st, 2nd and 3rd in the FIDE Women‚Äôs World Cup 2023. > If the FIDE Women‚Äôs World Champion 2023 and/or one of the players qualified via tracks A or B is (are) among these three qualifiers, the unallocated spot(s) shall, in order of priority: > - be awarded by rating*; > - be awarded to the player who finishes 4th in the FIDE Women‚Äôs World Cup 2023 (if she has not qualified via tracks A or B); > - became (an) additional spot(s) at the FIDE Women‚Äôs Grand Swiss 2023. > \* The spot shall be awarded to the player having the highest standard rating among non-qualified players in the January 2024 FIDE rating list, provided she has played at least 30 games rated in the FIDE standard rating lists from February 2023 to January 2024. If two or more players have equal ratings, the drawing of lots shall be used to determine the qualifier. > D. 2 spots ‚Äì FIDE Women‚Äôs Grand Swiss 2023 > The players who finish 1st and 2nd in the FIDE Women‚Äôs Grand Swiss 2023. > If the FIDE Women‚Äôs World Champion 2023 and/or one of the players qualified via tracks A, B or C is (are) among these two qualifiers, the unallocated spot(s) shall be awarded to the next non-qualifying player of the FIDE Women‚Äôs Grand Swiss 2023. > If any replacement is needed, the spot shall be awarded to the player having the highest standard rating among non-qualified players in the January 2024 FIDE rating list, provided she has played at least 30 games rated in the FIDE standard rating lists from February 2023 to January 2024. Now, there are two main ways one could go about resolving the above regulatory mess, and sadly, they yield completely different results. Here they are. **Method \#1** You treat the World Cup replacement list as if it was a queue, filling however many spots necessary with the players ""in order of priority"" set by that list. This means that for the empty World Cup spot, you consider: * Hou Yifan (""the player having the highest standard rating among non-qualified players in the January 2024 FIDE rating list""), provided she has played at least 30 games - and as Hou Yifan didn't ding her way to that requirement, the spot's not awarded to her (and this is the TL;DR of the problem: do you look further down the rating list); * Tan Zhongyi (4th place finisher in the World Cup) - she's not qualified through tracks A or B (runner-up of previous WC match or Grand Prix), so she gets that spot. However, this in turn frees up Tan Zhongyi's spot from the Grand Swiss (she's finished 3rd, but Anna Muzychuk was already qualified through Grand Prix). Meaning - the 4th place finisher in the Grand Swiss, Batkhuyagiin M√∂ng√∂ntuul would take it. Note that, by this method, even if at this point you consider that the World Cup spot does not go to Tan Zhongyi, as she's by now also already qualified through track D, Grand Swiss (although not explicitly stated), it consistently yields ""an additional spot at the FIDE Grand Swiss"". **Method \#2** You consider the World Cup replacement spots as three separate spots, each item of the list only in effect when needed. This means that: * if one of the top 3 in the World Cup had already qualified (the case this year), it goes through rating and rating only: the rating list is sourced as deep as it takes to find an eligible player who's not qualified yet - this would be Koneru Humpy; * if two of the top 3 in the World Cup were already qualified, one spot goes to the rating list (as above), the second goes to the 4th place World Cup finisher (Tan Zhongyi, who at that point had not qualified yet); * if all three of the top 3 in the World Cup already qualified, the first spot goes to the rating list, the second goes to the 4th place finisher, and the third spot becomes the Grand Swiss spot. This is seemingly what FIDE went with, as [Koneru is listed on the Cycle page](https://wcc.fide.com/womencycle2023_2025.phtml). **So, which one's correct?** It's not as obvious as it seems, and hopefully reading through both methods above leaves you with the same feeling. Several wording details suggest FIDE drops the ball on that one to at least some extent: * there's a clear difference between ""the player with the highest rating among non-qualified, provided she played 30 games"" and ""the player with the highest rating among non-qualified who played 30 games"" - this was never a problem, as rating replacements used to come only at the end of any replacement procedures, meaning you had to did as deep as necessary anyway; * it's not explicitly stated what happens to the 4th place World Cup spot if that player had also already qualified (so, at least two out of top 3 + 4th place are WC match participants and/or two Grand Prix winners): does it fall back to the general provision (rating list) or does it fall back to the Grand Swiss? * if the 4th place spot does not fall back to the Grand Swiss, it's impossible for more than one World Cup spot to become additional Grand Swiss spots (even if all four of top 4 are both WC match participants and 2 Grand Prix winners - two spots go to rating, one spot goes to Grand Swiss) - and yet World Cup replacement list uses that weird singular/plural construction regarding Grand Swiss spots; * if the 4th place spot falls back to the Grand Swiss, why wouldn't the rating spot also fall back to the next replacement (4th place, then Grand Swiss if necessary), if strict wording of the rating spot is applied? * finally, what's up with ""in order of priority"", then? However, on the other hand: * there is a clear practical advantage to method \#2: all the spots and all replacement procedures are resolved as they occur; * there's no need for a retroactive mingling, like moving Tan Zhongyi from the Grand Swiss spot back to the World Cup spot months after both events were played; * there's also the safety net of never running out of replacement by rating - if the rating replacements provision was to be read strictly, it wouldn't allow for further replacements. There's also no real precedent, as it's only the second time Women's Candidates uses simliar qualifying cycle to the Open, and previously the rating replacement was only the final replacement procedure (not in place for the World Cup spot). All I know is that if I were a sports lawyer at the Mongolian Chess Federation, I'd consider rubbing my hands right now."	3.0	t3_18v9c61	reddit

598	How to find best moves you don‚Äôt understand?	Unknown	2023-12-31 19:23:46	https://www.chess.com/daily/game/594458003	"Blind spots for ‚Äúbest‚Äù moves? I have been playing chess my whole life, but have never really peaked beyond 12-1300. This is a daily game against one of my friends who is closest to me in skill. I feel like I am at my best. I see mistakes after I make them but I don‚Äôt know how to change how I look at positions to see that beforehand. I really want to win these games, sometimes I spend 15-20 mins looking at my move before I play, I really think it‚Äôs about the best I can do, but the computer consistently puts my accuracy between 70-85%. I get games in the high 90% sometimes and have had perfect games in lines I know, but I can‚Äôt seem to play that well against this person. Sometimes the computer shows best move and it‚Äôs obvious in retrospect. Like on move 7 I should have moved my rook to C1 first, I know that move I just missed it. But when it says both of us moving our bishops out to the F file on move 5 I don‚Äôt understand why that is a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù. I ended up winning this game because my bishop was on the F file. I almost always move my bishop out in this opening and sometimes it‚Äôs best move but others it‚Äôs a mistake. I have played the pawn takes knight takes queen to b3 line it suggests before but I don‚Äôt understand why that is so much better. Same thing with Qa4 on move 15. It calls this a mistake, but the line it suggests is something I hadn‚Äôt even considered. I see now how it created two really strong pawns, but so many of the moves getting there don‚Äôt make sense to me, I feel like my opponent would rarely make the moves it shows for black. In facts the moves my opponent did make that it also called mistakes where the ones I expected. I just blundered when I castled, I calculated for them trading pawns and just didn‚Äôt consider them pushing the pawn up 1, but then it calls Qd1 a mistake. I did it seeing the line that played out, repositioning my queen to e6 for the check, and that led to a mate in 11 and a number of moves it called ‚Äúgreat‚Äù. Finally the mate in 11. I could almost see it. It felt intuitive that there was a mate here with my bishop and queen. That sequence took place over 3/4 days. I find myself in a bunch of positions where I feel like I know there is a mate but I just can‚Äôt find it. Sacrificing the exchange seems obvious after the computer shows me, but I couldn‚Äôt see that move at all when looking. How do I train myself to find these kinds of moves when sometimes I don‚Äôt even understand them until they are explained to me?

And while it's true he came up through school without the internet, he was a young man when the internet came around. Hikaru himself is 36, not that much younger. So I'm not sure what my question is really, just if anyone has any comments on this or noticed the same, or observations related to this.

I will agree 100% that what happened to Anna-Maja Kazarian is wrong, but if we start relaxing rules and allowing ""players to express their styles"" we will end up in situations where players will do things like coming in extremely revealing clothing, arriving in sparkly shirts/dresses that reflect light, coming in weird costumes or even stripping during a match - all to distract the opponent... This would be excarbated when players are matched up against religious Jewish/Islamic male players who would have to forfeit matches to not go against their religion Do we really want this? Edit: Since it seems like people did not understand me, I am NOT saying Anna-Maja Kazarian should have been fined for shoes... I am saying that while there has to be SOME flexibility we cannot advocate for scrapping the dress code entirely or by reducing it to nothing Edit 2: So I see people are so immature that they are attacking me personally instead of trying to refute my point beyond a claim of ""This will never happen""...

631	An unpopular opinion regarding the Candidates	Unknown	2023-12-31 11:58:18	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18v6cam/an_unpopular_opinion_regarding_the_candidates/	"Hey Now that we know all the current qualifiers for the Candidates Tournament 2024, I have seen people here bashing the quality of the current Candidates. However I think that these criticisms are completely unjustified, and I will explain why I think the current Candidates are actually stronger than the 2022 Candidates. To preface my position I will say that FIDE ratings have massively deflated this year due to the ratings not taking into account the globalization of chess creating thousands of new players without wnough opportunities, as well as the proliferation of online resources allowing players to peak at ever lower ages. With this in mind, I will subjectively judge players based on skill and relevant form. I also will preface that I consider the actual Candidates performance in 2022 to be irrelevant since 2024 has not happened yet, and I apologise for any misspellings. Now for a comparison between the 2 sets of players. 1. Nijat Abasov (2024) < Jan-Krzystof Duda (2022) Ok, this one is obvious... Nijat Abasov is not even in the top 3 Azerbaijani players and is very lucky to even be there. 2. Dommaraju Gukesh (2024) > Richard Rapport (2022) Rapport is probably the most exciting player around and has been compared to Mikhail Tal, but at the same time he is extremely inconsistent and has not had good results. Meanwhile, Gukesh started the year on absolute fire, and while his form dipped his performances in Chennai show that he is still way up there 3. Ian Nepomniatchchi = Ian Nepomniatchci 4. Alireza Firouzja = Alireza Firouzja 5. Hikaru Nakamura = Hikaru Nakamura All 3 have been at both tournaments, and have not seen any abnormal declines or rises recently. A case could be made for Alireza being worse and Hikaru better in 2024, but those cancel each other out either way 6. Fabiano Caruana (2024) > Fabiano Caruana (2022) This is the only returning player with a significant difference - Fabiano has been on an INSANE tear this year winning almost everything and qualifying or near-qualifying for the Candidates 4 different ways while exhibiting a performance even superior to Magnus in classical, so we can comfortably say he is better now 7. Vidit Santosh Gujrathi (2024) > Teimour Radjabov (2022) This one is probably the most contriversial decision on this list - but if you look at recent performances Vidit has been tearing it up almost as much as Fabiano, only JUST missing the World Cup slot and being very close to the Circuit and Ranking slots also, while Teimour only got his spot due to a COVID makeup policy and was not in good form then 8. Praggnandha Rameshbabu (2024) < Ding Liren (2022) A very tricky comparison given Ding Liren did not have any real competitive matches going into the qualification due to China's absurd COVID policy while Pragg's World Cup was astounding, but I will give the edge to Ding given his experience and that he became WC after the tournament As you can see, while it is close there are 3 players from 2024 that are clearly better than their equivalents in 2022, while only 2 players from 2022 better than 2024. As a result we can see that 2024 REALLY holds its own, and must not be dismissed as ""low quality"" or anything like that I would love to hear your thoughts though..."	15.0	t3_18v6cam	reddit

However, for a sport that relies almost completely on sponsorships, I can't help but feel that I'd have an incredibly difficult time justifying giving chess/FIDE money when... Top players are pointing accusatory fingers at each other with essentially baseless ""facts"" Former World Champions are actively going senile and going after *literal* children on public forums and top players are indirectly defending them Top players are purposefully playing inferior opponents in last minute, thrown together ""tournaments"" to farm rating and beat the system Top players are found guilty of fixing tournament games (which, by all accounts, is cheating) One of those players goes to a public forum to make a joke about being deducted .5 points in a game which he fixed FIDE's general decentralization, lack of commitment, and incredibly outdated policies Idk maybe I'm being over critical, but the ""Chess Drama"" has kind of changed from amusing to concerning for the game imo, and shined a very unflattering light on a good portion of the top players.

635	A (2nd) Chinese anal bead cheating scandal and the dangers of speculation and false reporting	Unknown	2023-12-31 23:54:56	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18vkdgl/a_2nd_chinese_anal_bead_cheating_scandal_and_the/	On December 18th, a 48 year old Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) champion called Yan Chenglong was stripped of his title, forfeit his prize money from a recent tournament and was banned from competing in professional Chinese chess for an year. Why? Officially, Yan was only punished for defecating in a hotel room bathtub. But this incident created a whirlwind of rumors that he was cheating with anal beads, much like Hans Niemann. Too much like Hans Niemann. While there is still a lot of controversy over Niemann, we can say with a fair degree of confidence that he did not use anal beads to cheat. Yes, he is an unpleasant person with a bit of main character syndrome and a history of cheating, but that doesn't mean it was justified to slander him with the anal beads rumor or treat it as a joke. Such an accusation is grounds for severe emotional distress; and regardless of what Niemann does in the future, this rumor of anal bead cheating will follow him for the rest of his life. Likewise, there are similar ambiguities and uncertainties around Yan Chenglong's story as well. First of all, this wasn't the first time Yan was accused of improper behavior and he was first caught defecating in a bathtub in 2021 (Also after a tournament). Since there was never a similar scandal in 2021, it is extremely likely that the only reason Yan got accused of cheating with anal beads was precisely because of Niemann. Many people also skipped the fact that he was drinking heavily with friends the night before on both occasions. Without any other evidence of cheating, it is very likely that Yan is simply a heavy partier with extremely questionable hygienic habits. This is not to justify his hotel bathtub bowel movements, but to show that we shouldn't be accusing people of both scandalous and immoral behavior for our personal entertainment because those rumors have very real effects on other people. All the information above can be found within the two sources below, on of which paraphrases the interview where Yan admits to defecating but denies cheating. (For the record I do think he was cheating, but without sufficient evidence it is at most a theory) &#x200B; Sources: [https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/674908165](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/674908165) (Chinese 'Quora' source that includes interview with Yan) [https://news.cctv.com/2023/12/27/ARTIQgU4elQVzr92Cy1YHS99231227.shtml](https://news.cctv.com/2023/12/27/ARTIQgU4elQVzr92Cy1YHS99231227.shtml) (cross-posted from CCTV, or China Central Television site, most 'official source' I could find)	5.0	t3_18vkdgl	reddit

However, sometimes someone just starts talking mad shit right off the bat, completely unprovoked. Sometimes i can shrug it off, but i definitely lose a disproportionate amount of these games, AND games after. I feel like a report for blatant cursing/ insults at the game should be awarded a refund of points in case of losses, cause it can really mess with your game. At this point, I feel like reports of these nature do nothing at all. What do you guys think? I really believe the points should be refunded. Probably [chess.com](https://chess.com) doesn't want to do the extra work to review 'who started' in some cases, but most often it's clear enough that someone is looking to be mean on purpose. I think 3 verified reports of such behaviour in a month or so should be an automatic ban as well. Lastly, happy new year y'all, keep it classy in 2024 plz as a resolution for the salty players.

There are serious imbalances in almost every games. Alireza accepts for example completely shattered pawn structures, etc... Clearly, he wants a win. 2. All respect to his opponents! They play well for their ratings, and they play without fear. One lower rated player sacs a piece in the opening, and Shirazi sacs a pawn. 3. Most importantly, these games are very instructive. It is a bit like watching Morphy smash European nobility...Morphy understood time in a way that they didn't and we can learn by watching him. Similarly, Alireza is bringing his 2700+ chess knowledge against weaker opponents. Against another super-GM, there's no way for most of us to follow it, but here we can see these major imbalances and then see it all suddenly resolve in Alireza's favor. This is great stuff!

For players in the range of 1600 to 2200 FIDE, how frequently do you get to unleash the Marshall Attack when facing the Ruy Lopez? I usually get the ""You know, so many people play anti-Marshalls nowadays"". Many, true, but not the majority it would seem.

To rage, I guess, as I just finished a terrible session where I repeatedly got into severe time trouble, ultimately blowing completely won positions. Time management is by far the weakest point of my game right now. I am a very slow thinker due partly to my aging brain, and the fact that I am a perfectionist and like to squeeze out every fraction of a centipawn that I can get out of a position. I am extremely cognizant during my games that I need to play faster, but despite my best efforts, I always end up in major time trouble. Lately, I've been getting down to around 2 minutes when my opponents have 5 or 6. I should mention that I'm referring to 10+0. I know what you're saying: ""play with increment!"". Yes, I know. But the thing is, I've only ever had this one account, and on Rapid I've only ever played 10+0, and I don't want to play with increment because it would be a different player base and also affect my rating, which has always been on 10+0, and which I care so much about because I've always enjoyed trying to set new personal bests and track my improvement (or lack thereof) over time. But perhaps I have no right to complain then, since I choose not to play with increment? Even so, I am still thinking far too long. After the game I'll find myself spending 50, 65, 90, even 120 seconds on moves - and often the moves aren't even remotely critical! But it's not just about my conscious decision to think longer - I feel I'm just a slower thinker. I didn't used to be, but again I think age has been catching up with me. It often feels like I'm in a time warp... it'll feel like I'm playing at a decent speed, then I'll suddenly notice that I have 3 minutes left and my opponent 6 or 7. It's extra frustrating because in most of these games I'm often completely winning (like +3 or +8), but just can't convert when I am down to a minute because I'm not a bullet player. Sorry for the pointless post, I just needed to rant. I'd play more classical, but it can be hard to get a game, and it seems like at least half my opponents have a very high RD (rating deviation) from being a new account, or simply an account that doesn't play much classical, which I don't like because it skews the rating. &#x200B;"	4.0	t3_18uze6p	reddit

Final score, 2 wins, 1 draw, 4 losses.. I was very upset cause there were two times i was in a winning position and blundered both of them.. but it was a good experience and looking forward for many tournaments ahead	1.0	t3_18ud5h0	reddit

My only problem is with the double standard. These guys are not getting punished because they planned the draw but they are getting punished because they tried to make a protest. If it was another prearranged Berlin draw nobody would have any problem with it &#x200B; I know one of the problems is they discussed beforehand but it is weird to apply this only now and never before when top players did the Berlin draw literally thousands of times. My problem is the insane double standard In world Blitz Chess Championship 2022(last year), Rapport with white drew against Nakamura with Black in Berlin and Hikaru with that drew took the second place. Now I am not gonna blame Nakamura for taking a draw with black but if his half point was deleted because he accepted to take white's draw offer without even playing the game (the Berlin draw ) then he wouldn't be in second place. Similarly if Dubov had half a point more would be tied to first with Magnus. One can also have an outlandish idea to claim that Levon Aronian prematurely offered draw to Carlsen last game even tho Levon was playing with white pieces and Carlsen got a ""free"" draw without making his 20th move. Imagine the outrage if this was Nepo vs Dubov, Nepo offered Dubov a draw in this position that clinched Dubov the tournament victory. Either make all the early draws have zero points for everyone(ban the draw offer) at the start of tournament or don't ban it ever. It doesn't make sense to introduce a rule in middle of the event . Dubov-Nepo is matchfixing yes. It is not more of a matchfixing than most Berlin draws that has happened for 10 years.

In the previous round Artemiev was late for his game against Dubov, because he wasn't allowed in without a badge. Seriously??? He is super gm. He is third in terms of rating points and security doesn't allow him to play without a badge??? And the round just started without Artemiev... To illustrate how ridiculous this is. Imagine if a football match started 10 vs 11 without Messi, because security wouldn't allow Messi on a field without a badge. Possibly other situations like this about which we don't know. If this is the level of organization, I can understand why Dubov wanted to protest.	14.0	t3_18vbnqb	reddit

He won 8.7 elo points from that tournament and he finished the year above Wesley So in the rating list, even if Chartres is not takent into account. I do think FIDE is therefore not going to bother about Chartres, since it could imply a difficult procedure and would not change the fact that Alireza has passed Wesley So. I did not like the organization of the Chartres matches but do not really have any issues with the participation of Alireza in the Rouen Open. Maybe it is weird that the 2nd best player by a big margin was fromhis club and was clearly a sparring partner to make sure there is enough potential elo points to get, but it is an open tournament and anything can happen. If So wanted to qualify, he should have taken part in an open tournament too, like the one in Chennai where he was invited. I hope they get rid of the 2 weird qualification spots (elo & FIDE tournament points) for the next candidates and either just attribute qualification spots in different tournaments, or organize a match for the X best players according to elo who did not grab a qualification spot. It will still be possible to play games to qualify for these matches since the top chess players are quite close in elo but there will be less complaining since you still have to face some of the best to get your spot. I really hope all this doesn't end up with FIDE cancelling the games Alireza played and the qualification spot being debatted in front of CAS in Lausanne !	44.0	t3_18tm195	reddit

In any serious sport the correct term for this is match fixing, and the consequence is not a half point deduction, but a lengthy ban from competition. If chess wants to become an actually serious endeavour and aspire to become olympic and whatnot, it thoroughly needs to clean up its act, completely turn around it's culture, and professional chess players need to commit themselves to always compete to the best of their abilities as any other athletes do.

691	How do you train your intuition for evaluating positions?	Unknown	2023-12-30 14:01:43	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18uga9c/how_do_you_train_your_intuition_for_evaluating/	I'm around 1900 chess.com, and I'm noticing a consistent pattern of mistakes in my play that I'm not sure how to fix. When considering a long tactical sequence, I very frequently misevaluate the final position in my calculation and incorrectly choose to pursue the line or take an alternate one only to find that the end result I thought was benefiting one side was in fact +1.3 in the other direction. These poor evaluations often aren't the results of tactical oversights but rather not accurately assessing that the resulting piece activity more than compensates for material gain or that the weaknesses created by the change in pawn structure are much easier/harder to defend than I see at a distance. Or, in other words, the reason these positions are winning/losing is in the form of some long-term pressure rather than any material imbalance that arises within the next 10 moves. Part of the issue is that when those positions do arise on the board and I can start considering various plans for each side, I can almost always evaluate who is better. However, when I need to make a quick judgement call of the position at the end of one possible branch of tactics, my intuition is way off. I find this is also regularly the case when watching GM commentary of tournament games. For example, they'll switch to a game and immediately agree that the nearly 0.00 position is terrible for white from a practical standpoint, whereas it would take me a very long time (if ever) to come to that conclusion. So, is there a way of actively training your intuition about the evaluation of a position? I'd appreciate any help.	1.0	t3_18uga9c	reddit

700	The $\star$-operator and Invariant Subtraction Games	Urban Larsson	2010-09-21 21:17:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.4220v1	We study 2-player impartial games, so called \emph{invariant subtraction games}, of the type, given a set of allowed moves the players take turn in moving one single piece on a large Chess board towards the position $\boldsymbol 0$. Here, invariance means that each allowed move is available inside the whole board. Then we define a new game, $\star$ of the old game, by taking the $P$-positions, except $\boldsymbol 0$, as moves in the new game. One such game is $\W^\star=$ (Wythoff Nim)$^\star$, where the moves are defined by complementary Beatty sequences with irrational moduli. Here we give a polynomial time algorithm for infinitely many $P$-positions of $\W^\star$. A repeated application of $\star$ turns out to give especially nice properties for a certain subfamily of the invariant subtraction games, the \emph{permutation games}, which we introduce here. We also introduce the family of \emph{ornament games}, whose $P$-positions define complementary Beatty sequences with rational moduli---hence related to A. S. Fraenkel's `variant' Rat- and Mouse games---and give closed forms for the moves of such games. We also prove that ($k$-pile Nim)$^{\star\star}$ = $k$-pile Nim.			arxiv	[]	253.0
701	Efficient Bayesian Inference for Generalized Bradley-Terry Models	Francois Caron	2010-11-08 10:40:19	http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1761v1	The Bradley-Terry model is a popular approach to describe probabilities of the possible outcomes when elements of a set are repeatedly compared with one another in pairs. It has found many applications including animal behaviour, chess ranking and multiclass classification. Numerous extensions of the basic model have also been proposed in the literature including models with ties, multiple comparisons, group comparisons and random graphs. From a computational point of view, Hunter (2004) has proposed efficient iterative MM (minorization-maximization) algorithms to perform maximum likelihood estimation for these generalized Bradley-Terry models whereas Bayesian inference is typically performed using MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) algorithms based on tailored Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) proposals. We show here that these MM\ algorithms can be reinterpreted as special instances of Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms associated to suitable sets of latent variables and propose some original extensions. These latent variables allow us to derive simple Gibbs samplers for Bayesian inference. We demonstrate experimentally the efficiency of these algorithms on a variety of applications.			arxiv	['Arnaud Doucet']	254.0

The deliberate process we call reasoning is, I believe, the thinnest veneer of human thought, effective only because it is supported by this much older and much powerful, though usually unconscious, sensor motor knowledge. We are all prodigious Olympians in perceptual and motor areas, so good that we make the difficult look easy. Abstract thought, though, is a new trick, perhaps less than 100 thousand years old. We have not yet mastered it. It is not all that intrinsically difficult; it just seems so when we do it.""- Hans Moravec Moravec's paradox is involved with the fact that it is the seemingly easier day to day problems that are harder to implement in a machine, than the seemingly complicated logic based problems of today.

Fir st results from the unbiased survey (Lefloch et al. 2010, Codella et al. 2010) reveal different molecular components at different excitation conditions coexisting in the B1 bow shock structure, with NH$_3$, H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH emitting only at relatively low outflow velocities whereas H$_2$O shows bright emission at high velocities. Our model suggests that these differences are purely chemical and can be explained by the presence of a C-type shock whose maximum temperature must be close to 4000 K along the B1 clump.			arxiv	['I.

We provide an in-depth analysis of the potential of UCT in domain-independent settings, in cases where heuristic values are available, and the effect of enhancing random playouts to more informed playouts between two weak minimax players. To provide further insights, we develop synthetic game tree instances and discuss interesting properties of UCT, both empirically and analytically.			arxiv	['Ashish Sabharwal', 'Bart Selman']	257.0
705	Measuring the Size of Large No-Limit Poker Games	Michael Johanson	2013-02-27 21:20:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.7008v2	"In the field of computational game theory, games are often compared in terms of their size. This can be measured in several ways, including the number of unique game states, the number of decision points, and the total number of legal actions over all decision points. These numbers are either known or estimated for a wide range of classic games such as chess and checkers. In the stochastic and imperfect information game of poker, these sizes are easily computed in ""limit"" games which restrict the players' available actions, but until now had only been estimated for the more complicated ""no-limit"" variants. In this paper, we describe a simple algorithm for quickly computing the size of two-player no-limit poker games, provide an implementation of this algorithm, and present for the first time precise counts of the number of game states, information sets, actions and terminal nodes in the no-limit poker games played in the Annual Computer Poker Competition."			arxiv	[]	258.0
706	Broad N2H+ emission towards the protostellar shock L1157-B1	C. Codella	2013-08-29 14:19:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.6478v1	We present the first detection of N2H+ towards a low-mass protostellar outflow, namely the L1157-B1 shock, at about 0.1 pc from the protostellar cocoon. The detection was obtained with the IRAM 30-m antenna. We observed emission at 93 GHz due to the J = 1-0 hyperfine lines. The analysis of the emission coupled with the HIFI CHESS multiline CO observations leads to the conclusion that the observed N2H+(1-0) line originates from the dense (> 10^5 cm-3) gas associated with the large (20-25 arcsec) cavities opened by the protostellar wind. We find a N2H+ column density of few 10^12 cm-2 corresponding to an abundance of (2-8) 10^-9. The N2H+ abundance can be matched by a model of quiescent gas evolved for more than 10^4 yr, i.e. for more than the shock kinematical age (about 2000 yr). Modelling of C-shocks confirms that the abundance of N2H+ is not increased by the passage of the shock. In summary, N2H+ is a fossil record of the pre-shock gas, formed when the density of the gas was around 10^4 cm-3, and then further compressed and accelerated by the shock.			arxiv	['S. Viti', 'C.

The structure of the proposed parity-check matrices significantly reduces the complexity of encoding and decoding. Interestingly, the constructed regular cycle codes with row-weights $t$, $3\leq t \leq 20$, $t\neq 7, 15, 16$, have the best lengths among the known regular girth-12 cycle codes. In addition, the proposed cycle codes can be easily extended to some high rate column weight-3 LDPC codes with girth 6. Simulation results show that the constructed codes achieve excellent performances, specially the constructed column weight 3 LDPC codes outperform LDPC codes based on Steiner triple systems (STS).			arxiv	['Ghaffar Raeisi']	260.0

Despite significant advances in learning algorithms, most algorithms adapt at times scales which are not relevant for interactions with humans, and therefore the advances in AI on this front have remained of a more theoretical nature. This has also hindered the experimental evaluation of how these algorithms perform against humans, as the length of experiments needed to evaluate them is beyond what humans are reasonably expected to endure (max 100 repetitions). This scenario is rapidly changing, as recent algorithms are able to converge to their functional regimes in shorter time-scales. Additionally, this shift opens up possibilities for experimental investigation: where do humans stand compared with these new algorithms? We evaluate humans experimentally against a representative element of these fast-converging algorithms. Our results indicate that the performance of at least one of these algorithms is comparable to, and even exceeds, the performance of people.			arxiv	['Jacob Crandall', 'Manuel Cebrian', 'Sherief Abdallah', 'Iyad Rahwan']	261.0

Voskoglou	2014-04-29 08:56:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7279v1	Contract bridge occupies nowadays a position of great prestige being, together with chess, the only mind games officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee. In the present paper an innovative method for assessing the total performance of bridge- players' belonging to groups of special interest(e.g. different bridge clubs during a tournament, men and women, new and old players, etc) is introduced, which is based on principles of fuzzy logic. For this, the cohorts under assessment are represented as fuzzy subsets of a set of linguistic labels characterizing their performance and the centroid defuzzification method is used to convert the fuzzy data collected from the game to a crisp number. This new method of assessment could be used informally as a complement of the official bridge-scoring methods for statistical and other obvious reasons. Two real applications related to simultaneous tournaments with pre-dealt boards, organized by the Hellenic Bridge Federation, are also presented, illustrating the importance of our results in practice.			arxiv	[]	262.0

Given a partially ordered set whose elements are colored black or white, the players Black and White take turns removing any maximal element of their own color. If there is no such element, the player loses. We prove that pomax games are always integer-valued and for colored tree posets and chess-colored Young diagram posets we give a simple formula for the value of the game. However, for pomax games on general posets of height 3 we show that the problem of deciding the winner is PSPACE-complete and for posets of height 2 we prove NP-hardness. Pomax games are just a special case of a larger class of integer-valued games that we call element-removal games, and we pose some open questions regarding element-removal games that are not pomax games.			arxiv	['Jonas Sj√∂strand']	263.0

712	Simulation of Pedestrian Movements Using Fine Grid Cellular Automata Model	Siamak Sarmady	2014-06-13 15:25:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3567v1	Crowd simulation is used for evacuation and crowd safety inspections, study of performance in crowd systems and animations. Cellular automata has been extensively used in modelling the crowd. In regular cellular automata models, each pedestrian occupies a single cell with the size of a pedestrian body. Since the space is divided into relatively large cells, the movements of pedestrians look like the movements of pieces on a chess board. Furthermore, all pedestrians have the same body size and speed. In this paper, a method called fine grid cellular automata is proposed in which smaller cells are used and pedestrian body may occupy several cells. The model allows the use of different body sizes, shapes and speeds for pedestrian. The proposed model is used for simulating movements of pedestrians toward a target. A typical walkway scenario is used to test and evaluate the model. The movements of pedestrians are smoother because of the finer grain discretization of movements and the simulation results match empirical speed-density graphs with good accuracy.			arxiv	['Fazilah Haron', 'Abdullah Zawawi Talib']	265.0

The Pantheon 1.0 dataset includes the 11,341 biographies present in more than 25 languages in Wikipedia and is enriched with: (i) manually verified demographic information (place and date of birth, gender) (ii) a taxonomy of occupations classifying each biography at three levels of aggregation and (iii) two measures of global popularity including the number of languages in which a biography is present in Wikipedia (L), and the Historical Popularity Index (HPI) a metric that combines information on L, time since birth, and page-views (2008-2013). We compare the Pantheon 1.0 dataset to data from the 2003 book, Human Accomplishments, and also to external measures of accomplishment in individual games and sports: Tennis, Swimming, Car Racing, and Chess. In all of these cases we find that measures of popularity (L and HPI) correlate highly with individual accomplishment, suggesting that measures of global popularity proxy the historical impact of individuals.			arxiv	['Shahar Ronen', 'Kevin Hu', 'Tiffany Lu', 'C√©sar A.

714	A Cellular Automaton for Blocking Queen Games	Matthew Cook	2015-06-03 23:17:45	http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01431v1	"We show that the winning positions of a certain type of two-player game form interesting patterns which often defy analysis, yet can be computed by a cellular automaton. The game, known as {\em Blocking Wythoff Nim}, consists of moving a queen as in chess, but always towards (0,0), and it may not be moved to any of $k-1$ temporarily ""blocked"" positions specified on the previous turn by the other player. The game ends when a player wins by blocking all possible moves of the other player. The value of $k$ is a parameter that defines the game, and the pattern of winning positions can be very sensitive to $k$. As $k$ becomes large, parts of the pattern of winning positions converge to recurring chaotic patterns that are independent of $k$. The patterns for large $k$ display an unprecedented amount of self-organization at many scales, and here we attempt to describe the self-organized structure that appears."			arxiv	['Urban Larsson', 'Turlough Neary']	267.0

Harvey	2015-07-05 17:39:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01810v1	We report observation of electron helical dichroism on a material with chiral structure. In analogy with circular dichroism, a common technique for molecular structural fingerprinting, we use a nanofabricated forked diffraction grating to prepare electron vortex beams with opposite orbital angular momenta incident upon metal nanoparticle clusters and post-select for a zero-orbital angular momentum final state. We observe a difference in the differential scattering probability for orbital angular momentum transfer from vortices with opposite handedness incident on chiral aluminum nanoparticle clusters at 3.5 $\pm$ 0.8 eV. We suggest that the observed electron helical dichroism is due to excitation of surface plasmon vortices.

716	Ranking by pairwise comparisons for Swiss-system tournaments	L√°szl√≥ Csat√≥	2015-08-27 09:34:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06773v1	Pairwise comparison matrices are widely used in Multicriteria Decision Making. This article applies incomplete pairwise comparison matrices in the area of sport tournaments, namely proposing alternative rankings for the 2010 Chess Olympiad Open tournament. It is shown that results are robust regarding scaling technique. In order to compare different rankings, a distance function is introduced with the aim of taking into account the subjective nature of human perception. Analysis of the weight vectors implies that methods based on pairwise comparisons have common roots. Visualization of the results is provided by Multidimensional Scaling on the basis of the defined distance. The proposed rankings give in some cases intuitively better outcome than currently used lexicographical orders.			arxiv	[]	269.0
717	Properties, Proved and Conjectured, of Keller, Mycielski, and Queen Graphs	Witold Jarnicki	2016-06-25 14:39:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07918v1	We prove several results about three families of graphs. For queen graphs, defined from the usual moves of a chess queen, we find the edge-chromatic number in almost all cases. In the unproved case, we have a conjecture supported by a vast amount of computation, which involved the development of a new edge-coloring algorithm. The conjecture is that the edge-chromatic number is the maximum degree, except when simple arithmetic forces the edge-chromatic number to be one greater than the maximum degree. For Mycielski graphs, we strengthen an old result that the graphs are Hamiltonian by showing that they are Hamilton-connected (except M(3), which is a cycle). For Keller graphs G(d), we establish, in all cases, the exact value of the chromatic number, the edge-chromatic number, and the independence number, and we get the clique covering number in all cases except 5 <= d <= 7. We also investigate Hamiltonian decompositions of Keller graphs, obtaining them up to G(6).			arxiv	['Wendy Myrvold', 'Peter Saltzman', 'Stan Wagon']	270.0
718	Cherenkov and Scintillation Light Separation in Organic Liquid Scintillators	J. Caravaca	2016-10-06 19:35:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02011v2	The CHErenkov / Scintillation Separation experiment (CHESS) has been used to demonstrate the separation of Cherenkov and scintillation light in both linear alkylbenzene (LAB) and LAB with 2g/L of PPO as a fluor (LAB/PPO). This is the first such demonstration for the more challenging LAB/PPO cocktail and improves on previous results for LAB. A time resolution of 338 +/- 12 ps FWHM results in an efficiency for identifying Cherenkov photons in LAB/PPO of 70 +/- 3% and 63 +/- 8% for time- and charge-based separation, respectively, with scintillation contamination of 36 +/- 5% and 38 +/- 4%. LAB/PPO data is consistent with a rise time of 0.75 +/- 0.25 ns.			arxiv	['F. B. Descamps', 'B. J. Land', 'M. Yeh', 'G. D. Orebi Gann']	271.0

The linear case with $k=1$ corresponds to standard permutations of $n$, and the circular case with $n=4$ and $k=6$ corresponds to a three-person chessboard. We give bijections of these rook placements to matrix form, one-line notation, and matchings on certain graphs. Finally, we define chained linear and circular alternating sign matrices, enumerate them for certain values of $n$ and $k$, and give bijections to analogues of monotone triangles, square ice configurations, and fully-packed loop configurations.			arxiv	['Chelsey Morrow', 'Ben Noteboom', 'Sara Solhjem', 'Jessica Striker', 'Corey Vorland']	272.0
720	Toward Quantum Combinatorial Games	Paul Dorbec	2017-01-09 14:34:41	http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02193v2	In this paper, we propose a Quantum variation of combinatorial games, generalizing the Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe proposed by Allan Goff. A combinatorial game is a two-player game with no chance and no hidden information, such as Go or Chess. In this paper, we consider the possibility of playing superpositions of moves in such games. We propose different rulesets depending on when superposed moves should be played, and prove that all these rulesets may lead similar games to different outcomes. We then consider Quantum variations of the game of Nim. We conclude with some discussion on the relative interest of the different rulesets.			arxiv	['Mehdi Mhalla']	273.0
721	Regular Boardgames	Jakub Kowalski	2017-06-08 07:22:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02462v2	We propose a new General Game Playing (GGP) language called Regular Boardgames (RBG), which is based on the theory of regular languages. The objective of RBG is to join key properties as expressiveness, efficiency, and naturalness of the description in one GGP formalism, compensating certain drawbacks of the existing languages. This often makes RBG more suitable for various research and practical developments in GGP. While dedicated mostly for describing board games, RBG is universal for the class of all finite deterministic turn-based games with perfect information. We establish foundations of RBG, and analyze it theoretically and experimentally, focusing on the efficiency of reasoning. Regular Boardgames is the first GGP language that allows efficient encoding and playing games with complex rules and with large branching factor (e.g.\ amazons, arimaa, large chess variants, go, international checkers, paper soccer).			arxiv	['Maksymilian Mika', 'Jakub Sutowicz', 'Marek Szyku≈Ça']	274.0
722	The Second Leaper Theorem	Nikolai Beluhov	2017-06-27 13:50:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08845v1	A $(p, q)$-leaper is a fairy chess piece that, from a square $a$, can move to any of the squares $a + (\pm p, \pm q)$ or $a + (\pm q, \pm p)$. Let $L$ be a $(p, q)$-leaper with $p + q$ odd and $C$ a cycle of $L$ within a $(p + q) \times (p + q)$ chessboard. We show that there exists a second leaper $M$, distinct from $L$, such that a Hamiltonian cycle $D$ of $M$ exists over the squares of $C$. We give descriptions of $C$ and $M$ in terms of continued fractions. We introduce the notion of a direction graph, roughly a leaper graph from which all information has been abstracted away save for the directions of the moves, and we study $C$ and $D$ in terms of direction graphs. We introduce the notion of a dual generalized chessboard, a generalized chessboard $B$ of more than one square such that the leaper graph of a leaper $L$ over $B$ is connected and isomorphic to the leaper graph of a second leaper $M$, distinct from $L$, over $B$, and we give constructions for dual generalized chessboards.			arxiv	[]	275.0
723	A Quantum N-Queens Solver	Valentin Torggler	2018-03-02 06:59:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00735v3	The N-queens problem is to find the position of N queens on an N by N chess board such that no queens attack each other. The excluded diagonals N-queens problem is a variation where queens cannot be placed on some predefined fields along diagonals. This variation is proven NP-complete and the parameter regime to generate hard instances that are intractable with current classical algorithms is known. We propose a special purpose quantum simulator that implements the excluded diagonals N-queens completion problem using atoms in an optical lattice and cavity-mediated long-range interactions. Our implementation has no overhead from the embedding allowing to directly probe for a possible quantum advantage in near term devices for optimization problems.			arxiv	['Philipp Aumann', 'Helmut Ritsch', 'Wolfgang Lechner']	276.0
724	Attacks and alignments: rooks, set partitions, and permutations	Richard Arratia	2018-07-11 02:13:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03926v2	We consider uniformly random set partitions of size $n$ with exactly $k$ blocks, and uniformly random permutations of size $n$ with exactly $k$ cycles, under the regime where $n-k \sim t\sqrt{n}$, $t>0$. In this regime, there is a simple approximation for the entire process of component counts; in particular, the number of components of size 3 converges in distribution to Poisson with mean $\frac{2}{3}t^2$ for set partitions and mean $\frac{4}{3}t^2$ for permutations, and with high probability all other components have size one or two. These approximations are proved, with preasymptotic error bounds, using combinatorial bijections for placements of $r$ rooks on a triangular half of an $n\times n$ chess board, together with the Chen--Stein method for processes of indicator random variables.			arxiv	['Stephen DeSalvo']	277.0
725	A $q$-Queens Problem. IV. Attacking Configurations and Their Denominators	Seth Chaiken	2018-07-10 06:17:37	http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04741v1	In Parts I-III we showed that the number of ways to place $q$ nonattacking queens or similar chess pieces on an $n\times n$ chessboard is a quasipolynomial function of $n$ whose coefficients are essentially polynomials in $q$. In this part we focus on the periods of those quasipolynomials. We calculate denominators of vertices of the inside-out polytope, since the period is bounded by, and conjecturally equal to, their least common denominator. We find an exact formula for that denominator of every piece with one move and of two-move pieces having a horizontal move. For pieces with three or more moves, we produce geometrical constructions related to the Fibonacci numbers that show the denominator grows at least exponentially with $q$.			arxiv	['Christopher R. H.

We demonstrate a method to measure phase in a scanning transmission electron microscope using a nanofabricated diffraction grating to produce multiple probe beams. The measured phase is more interpretable than phase-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques without an off-axis reference wave, and the resolution could surpass that of off-axis electron holography. We apply the technique to image nanoparticles, carbon sub- strates and electric fields. The contrast observed in experiments agrees well with contrast predicted in simulations.			arxiv	['Fehmi S.

This question is a version of the art gallery problem in which the guards can ""see"" whichever squares the rook or queen attacks. We show that floor(n/2) rooks or floor(n/3) queens are sufficient and sometimes necessary to guard a polyomino with n tiles. We also prove that finding the minimum number of rooks or the minimum number of queens needed to guard a polyomino is NP-hard. These results also apply to d-dimensional rooks and queens on d-dimensional polycubes. We also use bipartite matching theorems to describe sets of non-attacking rooks on polyominoes."			arxiv	['√ârika Rold√°n']	280.0
728	Finding the best design parameters for optical nanostructures using reinforcement learning	Iman Sajedian	2018-10-18 03:44:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10964v1	Recently, a novel machine learning model has emerged in the field of reinforcement learning known as deep Q-learning. This model is capable of finding the best possible solution in systems consisting of millions of choices, without ever experiencing it before, and has been used to beat the best human minds at complex games such as, Go and chess, which both have a huge number of possible decisions and outcomes for each move. With a human-level intelligence, it has been solved the problems that no other machine learning model could do before. Here, we show the steps needed for implementing this model on an optical problem. We investigated the colour generation by dielectric nanostructures and show that this model can find geometrical properties that can generate a much deeper red, green and blue colours compared to the ones found by human researchers. This technique can easily be extended to predict and find the best design parameters for other optical structures.			arxiv	['Trevon Badloe', 'Junsuk Rho']	281.0
729	The Entropy of Artificial Intelligence and a Case Study of AlphaZero from Shannon's Perspective	Bo Zhang	2018-12-14 06:06:29	http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05794v2	The recently released AlphaZero algorithm achieves superhuman performance in the games of chess, shogi and Go, which raises two open questions. Firstly, as there is a finite number of possibilities in the game, is there a quantifiable intelligence measurement for evaluating intelligent systems, e.g. AlphaZero? Secondly, AlphaZero introduces sophisticated reinforcement learning and self-play to efficiently encode the possible states, is there a simple information-theoretic model to represent the learning process and offer more insights in fostering strong AI systems? This paper explores the above two questions by proposing a simple variance of Shannon's communication model, the concept of intelligence entropy and the Unified Intelligence-Communication Model is proposed, which provide an information-theoretic metric for investigating the intelligence level and also provide an bound for intelligent agents in the form of Shannon's capacity, namely, the intelligence capacity. This paper then applies the concept and model to AlphaZero as a case study and explains the learning process of intelligent agent as turbo-like iterative decoding, so that the learning performance of AlphaZero may be quantitatively evaluated. Finally, conclusions are provided along with theoretical and practical remarks.			arxiv	['Bin Chen', 'Jin-lin Peng']	282.0
730	Open-ended Learning in Symmetric Zero-sum Games	David Balduzzi	2019-01-23 19:56:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08106v2	Zero-sum games such as chess and poker are, abstractly, functions that evaluate pairs of agents, for example labeling them `winner' and `loser'. If the game is approximately transitive, then self-play generates sequences of agents of increasing strength. However, nontransitive games, such as rock-paper-scissors, can exhibit strategic cycles, and there is no longer a clear objective -- we want agents to increase in strength, but against whom is unclear. In this paper, we introduce a geometric framework for formulating agent objectives in zero-sum games, in order to construct adaptive sequences of objectives that yield open-ended learning. The framework allows us to reason about population performance in nontransitive games, and enables the development of a new algorithm (rectified Nash response, PSRO_rN) that uses game-theoretic niching to construct diverse populations of effective agents, producing a stronger set of agents than existing algorithms. We apply PSRO_rN to two highly nontransitive resource allocation games and find that PSRO_rN consistently outperforms the existing alternatives.			arxiv	['Marta Garnelo', 'Yoram Bachrach', 'Wojciech M.

731	The Many AI Challenges of Hearthstone	Amy K. Hoover	2019-07-15 16:06:41	http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06562v1	Games have benchmarked AI methods since the inception of the field, with classic board games such as Chess and Go recently leaving room for video games with related yet different sets of challenges. The set of AI problems associated with video games has in recent decades expanded from simply playing games to win, to playing games in particular styles, generating game content, modeling players etc. Different games pose very different challenges for AI systems, and several different AI challenges can typically be posed by the same game. In this article we analyze the popular collectible card game Hearthstone (Blizzard 2014) and describe a varied set of interesting AI challenges posed by this game. Collectible card games are relatively understudied in the AI community, despite their popularity and the interesting challenges they pose. Analyzing a single game in-depth in the manner we do here allows us to see the entire field of AI and Games through the lens of a single game, discovering a few new variations on existing research topics.			arxiv	['Julian Togelius', 'Scott Lee', 'Fernando de Mesentier Silva']	284.0

Consider the cells in order, placing a queen in a cell if and only if it would not attack any earlier queen. The problem is to determine the positions of the queens. We study the problem for a doubly-infinite chessboard of size Z x Z numbered along a square spiral, and an infinite single-quadrant chessboard (of size N x N) numbered along antidiagonals. We give a fairly complete solution in the first case, based on the Tribonacci word. There are connections with combinatorial games.			arxiv	['Jeffrey Shallit', 'N. J. A. Sloane']	285.0
733	Learning higher-order logic programs	Andrew Cropper	2019-07-25 10:36:01	http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10953v1	A key feature of inductive logic programming (ILP) is its ability to learn first-order programs, which are intrinsically more expressive than propositional programs. In this paper, we introduce techniques to learn higher-order programs. Specifically, we extend meta-interpretive learning (MIL) to support learning higher-order programs by allowing for \emph{higher-order definitions} to be used as background knowledge. Our theoretical results show that learning higher-order programs, rather than first-order programs, can reduce the textual complexity required to express programs which in turn reduces the size of the hypothesis space and sample complexity. We implement our idea in two new MIL systems: the Prolog system \namea{} and the ASP system \nameb{}. Both systems support learning higher-order programs and higher-order predicate invention, such as inventing functions for \tw{map/3} and conditions for \tw{filter/3}. We conduct experiments on four domains (robot strategies, chess playing, list transformations, and string decryption) that compare learning first-order and higher-order programs. Our experimental results support our theoretical claims and show that, compared to learning first-order programs, learning higher-order programs can significantly improve predictive accuracies and reduce learning times.			arxiv	['Rolf Morel', 'Stephen H.

734	On the Graph Laplacian and the Rankability of Data	Thomas R. Cameron	2019-11-30 22:33:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00275v1	Recently, Anderson et al. (2019) proposed the concept of rankability, which refers to a dataset's inherent ability to produce a meaningful ranking of its items. In the same paper, they proposed a rankability measure that is based on a integer program for computing the minimum number of edge changes made to a directed graph in order to obtain a complete dominance graph, i.e., an acyclic tournament graph. In this article, we prove a spectral-degree characterization of complete dominance graphs and apply this characterization to produce a new measure of rankability that is cost-effective and more widely applicable. We support the details of our algorithm with several results regarding the conditioning of the Laplacian spectrum of complete dominance graphs and the Hausdorff distance between their Laplacian spectrum and that of an arbitrary directed graph with weights between zero and one. Finally, we analyze the rankability of datasets from the world of chess and college football.			arxiv	['Amy N. Langville', 'Heather C. Smith']	287.0

In the proposed method, original image may be encrypted by desire encryption algorithm. Most significant bit (MSB) of encrypted pixels are integrated to vacate room for embedding data bits. Integrated ones will be more resistant against failure of reconstruction if they are modified for embedding data bits. At the recipient, we employ chess-board predictor for lossless reconstruction of the original image by the aim of prediction-error analysis. Comparing to existent RDHEI algorithms, not only we propose a separable method to extract data bits, but also content-owner may attain a perfect reconstruction of the original image without having data hider key. Experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms state of the art ones.			arxiv	[]	288.0

We present a modification to the AlphaZero algorithm that requires only a total ordering over game outcomes, obviating the need to perform any quantitative balancing of reward components.

The model correctly predicts the development of a population around food sources and their migration in search of a new one when the known ones become saturated. Additionally, we compared our model to a pure random one and the population number was fitted to a logistic function for two interesting evolutions of the system.			arxiv	[]	290.0

Board games, video games and sports, however, are intractable by design, so ""ludological"" theories about these games as complex phenomena should be grounded in empiricism. A first ""ludometric"" concern is the empirical measurement of the amount of luck in various games. We argue against a narrow view of luck which includes only factors outside any player's control, and advocate for a holistic definition of luck as complementary to the variation in effective skill within a population of players. We introduce two metrics for luck in a game for a given population - one information theoretical, and one Bayesian, and discuss the estimation of these metrics using sparse, high-dimensional regression techniques. Finally, we apply these techniques to compare the amount of luck between various professional sports, between Chess and Go, and between two hobby board games: Race for the Galaxy and Seasons."			arxiv	['Martin T.

In this paper, we combine Approximate Dynamic Programming techniques and apply them to the continuous, non-linear and high dimensional dynamics of a quadcopter vehicle. We use a polynomial approximation of the dynamics and sum-of-squares programming techniques to compute a family of polynomial value function approximations for different tuning parameters. The resulting approximations to the optimal value function are combined in a point-wise maximum approach, which is used to compute the online policy. The success of the method is demonstrated in both simulations and experiments on a quadcopter. The control performance is compared to a linear time-varying Model Predictive Controller. The two methods are then combined to keep the computational benefits of a short horizon MPC and the long term performance benefits of the Approximate Dynamic Programming value function as the terminal cost.			arxiv	['Paul N.

C√©line Hocquette	2019-02-26 10:04:19	http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09835v1	World-class human players have been outperformed in a number of complex two person games (Go, Chess, Checkers) by Deep Reinforcement Learning systems. However, owing to tractability considerations minimax regret of a learning system cannot be evaluated in such games. In this paper we consider simple games (Noughts-and-Crosses and Hexapawn) in which minimax regret can be efficiently evaluated. We use these games to compare Cumulative Minimax Regret for variants of both standard and deep reinforcement learning against two variants of a new Meta-Interpretive Learning system called MIGO. In our experiments all tested variants of both normal and deep reinforcement learning have worse performance (higher cumulative minimax regret) than both variants of MIGO on Noughts-and-Crosses and Hexapawn. Additionally, MIGO's learned rules are relatively easy to comprehend, and are demonstrated to achieve significant transfer learning in both directions between Noughts-and-Crosses and Hexapawn.			arxiv	['Stephen H.

The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.			arxiv	['Sam McCandlish', 'Tom Henighan', 'Tom B.

742	First-Order Problem Solving through Neural MCTS based Reinforcement Learning	Ruiyang Xu	2021-01-11 19:54:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04167v1	The formal semantics of an interpreted first-order logic (FOL) statement can be given in Tarskian Semantics or a basically equivalent Game Semantics. The latter maps the statement and the interpretation into a two-player semantic game. Many combinatorial problems can be described using interpreted FOL statements and can be mapped into a semantic game. Therefore, learning to play a semantic game perfectly leads to the solution of a specific instance of a combinatorial problem. We adapt the AlphaZero algorithm so that it becomes better at learning to play semantic games that have different characteristics than Go and Chess. We propose a general framework, Persephone, to map the FOL description of a combinatorial problem to a semantic game so that it can be solved through a neural MCTS based reinforcement learning algorithm. Our goal for Persephone is to make it tabula-rasa, mapping a problem stated in interpreted FOL to a solution without human intervention.			arxiv	['Prashank Kadam', 'Karl Lieberherr']	295.0

This paper clarifies the connections between machine-learning algorithms to develop AIs and the econometrics of dynamic structural models through the case studies of three famous game AIs. Chess-playing Deep Blue is a calibrated value function, whereas shogi-playing Bonanza is an estimated value function via Rust's (1987) nested fixed-point method. AlphaGo's ""supervised-learning policy network"" is a deep neural network implementation of Hotz and Miller's (1993) conditional choice probability estimation; its ""reinforcement-learning value network"" is equivalent to Hotz, Miller, Sanders, and Smith's (1994) conditional choice simulation method. Relaxing these AIs' implicit econometric assumptions would improve their structural interpretability."			arxiv	[]	298.0
746	Solving the Rubik's Cube Without Human Knowledge	Stephen McAleer	2018-05-18 23:07:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07470v1	A generally intelligent agent must be able to teach itself how to solve problems in complex domains with minimal human supervision. Recently, deep reinforcement learning algorithms combined with self-play have achieved superhuman proficiency in Go, Chess, and Shogi without human data or domain knowledge. In these environments, a reward is always received at the end of the game, however, for many combinatorial optimization environments, rewards are sparse and episodes are not guaranteed to terminate. We introduce Autodidactic Iteration: a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that is able to teach itself how to solve the Rubik's Cube with no human assistance. Our algorithm is able to solve 100% of randomly scrambled cubes while achieving a median solve length of 30 moves -- less than or equal to solvers that employ human domain knowledge.			arxiv	['Forest Agostinelli', 'Alexander Shmakov', 'Pierre Baldi']	299.0
747	A0C: Alpha Zero in Continuous Action Space	Thomas M. Moerland	2018-05-24 11:33:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09613v1	A core novelty of Alpha Zero is the interleaving of tree search and deep learning, which has proven very successful in board games like Chess, Shogi and Go. These games have a discrete action space. However, many real-world reinforcement learning domains have continuous action spaces, for example in robotic control, navigation and self-driving cars. This paper presents the necessary theoretical extensions of Alpha Zero to deal with continuous action space. We also provide some preliminary experiments on the Pendulum swing-up task, empirically showing the feasibility of our approach. Thereby, this work provides a first step towards the application of iterated search and learning in domains with a continuous action space.			arxiv	['Joost Broekens', 'Aske Plaat', 'Catholijn M.

748	A Novel Quantum N-Queens Solver Algorithm and its Simulation and Application to Satellite Communication Using IBM Quantum Experience	Rounak Jha	2018-06-26 21:48:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10221v2	Quantum computers can potentially solve problems that are computationally intractable on a classical computer in polynomial time using quantum-mechanical effects such as superposition and entanglement. The N-Queens Problem is a notable example that falls under the class of NP-complete problems. It involves the arrangement of N chess queens on an N x N chessboard such that no queen attacks any other queen, i.e. no two queens are placed along the same row, column or diagonal. The best time complexity that a classical computer has achieved so far in generating all solutions of the N-Queens Problem is of the order O(N!). In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to generate all solutions to the N-Queens Problem for a given N in polynomial time of order O(N^3) and polynomial memory of order O(N^2) on a quantum computer. We simulate the 4-queens problem and demonstrate its application to satellite communication using IBM Quantum Experience platform.			arxiv	['Debaiudh Das', 'Avinash Dash', 'Sandhya Jayaraman', 'Bikash K.

749	Towards Understanding Chinese Checkers with Heuristics, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and Deep Reinforcement Learning	Ziyu Liu	2019-03-05 09:44:22	http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01747v2	The game of Chinese Checkers is a challenging traditional board game of perfect information that differs from other traditional games in two main aspects: first, unlike Chess, all checkers remain indefinitely in the game and hence the branching factor of the search tree does not decrease as the game progresses; second, unlike Go, there are also no upper bounds on the depth of the search tree since repetitions and backward movements are allowed. Therefore, even in a restricted game instance, the state-space of the game can still be unbounded, making it challenging for a computer program to excel. In this work, we present an approach that effectively combines the use of heuristics, Monte Carlo tree search, and deep reinforcement learning for building a Chinese Checkers agent without the use of any human game-play data. Experiment results show that our agent is competent under different scenarios and reaches the level of experienced human players.			arxiv	['Meng Zhou', 'Weiqing Cao', 'Qiang Qu', 'Henry Wing Fung Yeung', 'Vera Yuk Ying Chung']	302.0
750	Leveling the Playing Field -- Fairness in AI Versus Human Game Benchmarks	Rodrigo Canaan	2019-03-17 00:42:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07008v4	From the beginning if the history of AI, there has been interest in games as a platform of research. As the field developed, human-level competence in complex games became a target researchers worked to reach. Only relatively recently has this target been finally met for traditional tabletop games such as Backgammon, Chess and Go. Current research focus has shifted to electronic games, which provide unique challenges. As is often the case with AI research, these results are liable to be exaggerated or misrepresented by either authors or third parties. The extent to which these games benchmark consist of fair competition between human and AI is also a matter of debate. In this work, we review the statements made by authors and third parties in the general media and academic circle about these game benchmark results and discuss factors that can impact the perception of fairness in the contest between humans and machines			arxiv	['Christoph Salge', 'Julian Togelius', 'Andy Nealen']	303.0
751	Hyper-Parameter Sweep on AlphaZero General	Hui Wang	2019-03-19 17:38:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08129v1	Since AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero have achieved breakground successes in the game of Go, the programs have been generalized to solve other tasks. Subsequently, AlphaZero was developed to play Go, Chess and Shogi. In the literature, the algorithms are explained well. However, AlphaZero contains many parameters, and for neither AlphaGo, AlphaGo Zero nor AlphaZero, there is sufficient discussion about how to set parameter values in these algorithms. Therefore, in this paper, we choose 12 parameters in AlphaZero and evaluate how these parameters contribute to training. We focus on three objectives~(training loss, time cost and playing strength). For each parameter, we train 3 models using 3 different values~(minimum value, default value, maximum value). We use the game of play 6$\times$6 Othello, on the AlphaZeroGeneral open source re-implementation of AlphaZero. Overall, experimental results show that different values can lead to different training results, proving the importance of such a parameter sweep. We categorize these 12 parameters into time-sensitive parameters and time-friendly parameters. Moreover, through multi-objective analysis, this paper provides an insightful basis for further hyper-parameter optimization.			arxiv	['Michael Emmerich', 'Mike Preuss', 'Aske Plaat']	304.0
752	Understanding and Pushing the Limits of the Elo Rating Algorithm	Leszek Szczecinski	2019-10-02 22:23:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06081v1	This work is concerned with the rating of players/teams in face-to-face games with three possible outcomes: loss, win, and draw. This is one of the fundamental problems in sport analytics, where the very simple and popular, non-trivial algorithm was proposed by Arpad Elo in late fifties to rate chess players. In this work we explain the mathematical model underlying the Elo algorithm and, in particular, we explain what is the implicit but not yet spelled out, assumption about the model of draws. We further extend the model to provide flexibility and remove the unrealistic implicit assumptions of the Elo algorithm. This yields the new rating algorithm, we call $\kappa$-Elo, which is equally simple as the Elo algorithm but provides a possibility to adjust to the frequency of draws. The discussion of the importance of the appropriate choice of the parameters is carried out and illustrated using results from English Premier League football seasons.			arxiv	['Aymen Djebbi']	305.0
753	Multiplayer AlphaZero	Nick Petosa	2019-10-29 00:06:01	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13012v3	The AlphaZero algorithm has achieved superhuman performance in two-player, deterministic, zero-sum games where perfect information of the game state is available. This success has been demonstrated in Chess, Shogi, and Go where learning occurs solely through self-play. Many real-world applications (e.g., equity trading) require the consideration of a multiplayer environment. In this work, we suggest novel modifications of the AlphaZero algorithm to support multiplayer environments, and evaluate the approach in two simple 3-player games. Our experiments show that multiplayer AlphaZero learns successfully and consistently outperforms a competing approach: Monte Carlo tree search. These results suggest that our modified AlphaZero can learn effective strategies in multiplayer game scenarios. Our work supports the use of AlphaZero in multiplayer games and suggests future research for more complex environments.			arxiv	['Tucker Balch']	306.0
754	Leveraging Rationales to Improve Human Task Performance	Devleena Das	2020-02-11 04:51:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04202v1	Machine learning (ML) systems across many application areas are increasingly demonstrating performance that is beyond that of humans. In response to the proliferation of such models, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) has sought to develop techniques that enhance the transparency and interpretability of machine learning methods. In this work, we consider a question not previously explored within the XAI and ML communities: Given a computational system whose performance exceeds that of its human user, can explainable AI capabilities be leveraged to improve the performance of the human? We study this question in the context of the game of Chess, for which computational game engines that surpass the performance of the average player are widely available. We introduce the Rationale-Generating Algorithm, an automated technique for generating rationales for utility-based computational methods, which we evaluate with a multi-day user study against two baselines. The results show that our approach produces rationales that lead to statistically significant improvement in human task performance, demonstrating that rationales automatically generated from an AI's internal task model can be used not only to explain what the system is doing, but also to instruct the user and ultimately improve their task performance.			arxiv	['Sonia Chernova']	307.0

While Game AI was for a long time not very well recognized by the larger scientific community, it has established itself as a research area for developing and testing the most advanced forms of AI algorithms and articles covering advances in mastering video games such as StarCraft 2 and Quake III appear in the most prestigious journals. Because of the growth of the field, a single review cannot cover it completely. Therefore, we put a focus on important recent developments, including that advances in Game AI are starting to be extended to areas outside of games, such as robotics or the synthesis of chemicals. In this article, we review the algorithms and methods that have paved the way for these breakthroughs, report on the other important areas of Game AI research, and also point out exciting directions for the future of Game AI.			arxiv	['Mike Preuss']	308.0
756	Deep Reinforcement Learning for FlipIt Security Game	Laura Greige	2020-02-28 18:26:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12909v2	Reinforcement learning has shown much success in games such as chess, backgammon and Go. However, in most of these games, agents have full knowledge of the environment at all times. In this paper, we describe a deep learning model in which agents successfully adapt to different classes of opponents and learn the optimal counter-strategy using reinforcement learning in a game under partial observability. We apply our model to FlipIt, a two-player security game in which both players, the attacker and the defender, compete for ownership of a shared resource and only receive information on the current state of the game upon making a move. Our model is a deep neural network combined with Q-learning and is trained to maximize the defender's time of ownership of the resource. Despite the noisy information, our model successfully learns a cost-effective counter-strategy outperforming its opponent's strategies and shows the advantages of the use of deep reinforcement learning in game theoretic scenarios. We also extend FlipIt to a larger action-spaced game with the introduction of a new lower-cost move and generalize the model to $n$-player FlipIt.			arxiv	['Peter Chin']	309.0
757	A New Challenge: Approaching Tetris Link with AI	Matthias Muller-Brockhausen	2020-04-01 12:25:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00377v1	Decades of research have been invested in making computer programs for playing games such as Chess and Go. This paper focuses on a new game, Tetris Link, a board game that is still lacking any scientific analysis. Tetris Link has a large branching factor, hampering a traditional heuristic planning approach. We explore heuristic planning and two other approaches: Reinforcement Learning, Monte Carlo tree search. We document our approach and report on their relative performance in a tournament. Curiously, the heuristic approach is stronger than the planning/learning approaches. However, experienced human players easily win the majority of the matches against the heuristic planning AIs. We, therefore, surmise that Tetris Link is more difficult than expected. We offer our findings to the community as a challenge to improve upon.			arxiv	['Mike Preuss', 'Aske Plaat']	310.0
758	Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Auction Simulations	Medet Kanmaz	2020-04-06 15:48:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02764v1	Game theory has been developed by scientists as a theory of strategic interaction among players who are supposed to be perfectly rational. These strategic interactions might have been presented in an auction, a business negotiation, a chess game, or even in a political conflict aroused between different agents. In this study, the strategic (rational) agents created by reinforcement learning algorithms are supposed to be bidder agents in various types of auction mechanisms such as British Auction, Sealed Bid Auction, and Vickrey Auction designs. Next, the equilibrium points determined by the agents are compared with the outcomes of the Nash equilibrium points for these environments. The bidding strategy of the agents is analyzed in terms of individual rationality, truthfulness (strategy-proof), and computational efficiency. The results show that using a multi-agent reinforcement learning strategy improves the outcomes of the auction simulations.			arxiv	['Elif Surer']	311.0

This raises the question of whether a similar thing could be done for mathematics -- a MathZero. MathZero would require a formal foundation and an objective. We propose the foundation of set-theoretic dependent type theory and an objective defined in terms of the classification problem -- the problem of classifying concept instances up to isomorphism. The natural numbers arise as the solution to the classification problem for finite sets. Here we generalize classical Bourbaki set-theoretic isomorphism to set-theoretic dependent type theory. To our knowledge we give the first isomorphism inference rules for set-theoretic dependent type theory with propositional set-theoretic equality. The presentation is intended to be accessible to mathematicians with no prior exposure to type theory.			arxiv	[]	312.0

Caravaca	2020-05-30 04:30:01	http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00173v3	This paper presents measurements of the scintillation light yield and time profile for a number of concentration of water-based liquid scintillator, formulated from linear alkylbenzene (LAB) and 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO). We find that the scintillation light yield is linear with the concentration of liquid scintillator in water between 1 and 10% with a slope of 127.9+-17.0 ph/MeV/concentration and an intercept value of 108.3+-51.0 ph/MeV, the latter being illustrative of non-linearities with concentration at values less than 1%. This is larger than expected from a simple extrapolation of the pure liquid scintillator light yield. The measured time profiles are consistently faster than that of pure liquid scintillator, with rise times less than 250ps and prompt decay constants in the range of 2.1-2.85ns. Additionally, the separation between Cherenkov and scintillation light is quantified using cosmic muons in the CHESS experiment for each formulation, demonstrating an improvement in separation at the centimeter scale. Finally, we briefly discuss the prospects for large-scale detectors.			arxiv	['B. J. Land', 'M. Yeh', 'G. D. Orebi Gann']	313.0

In an effort to generalize the planning ability to the more general tasks where the environment dynamics are not available to the agent, researchers proposed the MuZero algorithm that can learn the dynamical model through the interactions with the environment. In this paper, we provide a way and the necessary theoretical results to extend the MuZero algorithm to more generalized environments with continuous action space. Through numerical results on two relatively low-dimensional MuJoCo environments, we show the proposed algorithm outperforms the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, a state-of-the-art model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm.			arxiv	['Werner Duvaud', 'Peng Wei']	314.0
762	The Effects of Quantum Randomness on a System Exhibiting Computational Creativity	Azlan Iqbal	2020-08-22 04:34:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11545v2	We present experimental results on the effects of using quantum or 'truly' random numbers, as opposed to pseudorandom numbers, in a system that exhibits computational creativity (given its ability to compose original chess problems). The results indicate that using quantum random numbers too often or too seldom in the composing process does not have any positive effect on the output generated. Interestingly, there is a 'sweet spot' of using quantum random numbers 15% of the time that results in fewer statistical outliers. Overall, it would appear that there may indeed be a slight advantage to using quantum random numbers in such a system and this may also be true in other systems that exhibit computational creativity. The benefits of doing so should, however, be weighed against the overhead of obtaining quantum random numbers in contrast to a pseudorandom number generator that is likely more convenient to incorporate.			arxiv	[]	315.0
763	Naive Artificial Intelligence	Tomer Barak	2020-09-04 13:40:10	http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02185v1	In the cognitive sciences, it is common to distinguish between crystal intelligence, the ability to utilize knowledge acquired through past learning or experience and fluid intelligence, the ability to solve novel problems without relying on prior knowledge. Using this cognitive distinction between the two types of intelligence, extensively-trained deep networks that can play chess or Go exhibit crystal but not fluid intelligence. In humans, fluid intelligence is typically studied and quantified using intelligence tests. Previous studies have shown that deep networks can solve some forms of intelligence tests, but only after extensive training. Here we present a computational model that solves intelligence tests without any prior training. This ability is based on continual inductive reasoning, and is implemented by deep unsupervised latent-prediction networks. Our work demonstrates the potential fluid intelligence of deep networks. Finally, we propose that the computational principles underlying our approach can be used to model fluid intelligence in the cognitive sciences.			arxiv	['Yehonatan Avidan', 'Yonatan Loewenstein']	316.0

These equivalences are not exploited by current state of the art neural agents which instead must relearn similar information, thereby wasting computing time. Group equivariant CNNs in existing work create networks which can exploit symmetries to improve learning, however, they lack the expressiveness to correctly reflect the move embeddings necessary for games. We introduce Finite Group Neural Networks (FGNNs), a method for creating agents with an innate understanding of these board positions. FGNNs are shown to improve the performance of networks playing checkers (draughts), and can be easily adapted to other games and learning problems. Additionally, FGNNs can be created from existing network architectures. These include, for the first time, those with skip connections and arbitrary layer types. We demonstrate that an equivariant version of U-Net (FGNN-U-Net) outperforms the unmodified network in image segmentation.			arxiv	['Joeran Beel']	317.0

We argue that the POSG model is conceptually ill suited to software MARL environments, and offer case studies from the literature where this mismatch has led to severely unexpected behavior. In response to this, we introduce the Agent Environment Cycle Games (AEC Games) model, which is more representative of software implementation. We then prove it's as an equivalent model to POSGs. The AEC games model is also uniquely useful in that it can elegantly represent both all forms of MARL environments, whereas for example POSGs cannot elegantly represent strictly turn based games like chess.			arxiv	['Nathaniel Grammel', 'Benjamin Black', 'Ananth Hari', 'Caroline Horsch', 'Luis Santos']	318.0

They allow for succinct encoding of the experiences we have through a variety of sensory inputs. Also, they are believed to be arranged hierarchically, allowing for an efficient representation of complex long-horizon experiences. Additionally, these representations are acquired in a self-supervised manner. Analogously, here we propose a model that learns temporal representations from long-horizon visual demonstration data and associated textual descriptions, without explicit temporal supervision. Our method produces a hierarchy of representations that align more closely with ground-truth human-annotated events (+15.3) than state-of-the-art unsupervised baselines. Our results are comparable to heavily-supervised baselines in complex visual domains such as Chess Openings, YouCook2 and TutorialVQA datasets. Finally, we perform ablation studies illustrating the robustness of our approach. We release our code and demo visualizations in the Supplementary Material.			arxiv	['Sumedh A.

Tree-based planning methods from AlphaGo to Muzero have enjoyed huge success in discrete domains, such as chess and Go. Unfortunately, in real-world applications like robot control and inverted pendulum, whose action space is normally continuous, those tree-based planning techniques will be struggling. To address those limitations, in this paper, we present a novel model-based reinforcement learning frameworks called Critic PI2, which combines the benefits from trajectory optimization, deep actor-critic learning, and model-based reinforcement learning. Our method is evaluated for inverted pendulum models with applicability to many continuous control systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Critic PI2 achieved a new state of the art in a range of challenging continuous domains. Furthermore, we show that planning with a critic significantly increases the sample efficiency and real-time performance. Our work opens a new direction toward learning the components of a model-based planning system and how to use them.			arxiv	['He Ba', 'Xian Guo', 'Jianye Hao']	320.0

769	Monte-Carlo Graph Search for AlphaZero	Johannes Czech	2020-12-20 22:51:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11045v1	The AlphaZero algorithm has been successfully applied in a range of discrete domains, most notably board games. It utilizes a neural network, that learns a value and policy function to guide the exploration in a Monte-Carlo Tree Search. Although many search improvements have been proposed for Monte-Carlo Tree Search in the past, most of them refer to an older variant of the Upper Confidence bounds for Trees algorithm that does not use a policy for planning. We introduce a new, improved search algorithm for AlphaZero which generalizes the search tree to a directed acyclic graph. This enables information flow across different subtrees and greatly reduces memory consumption. Along with Monte-Carlo Graph Search, we propose a number of further extensions, such as the inclusion of Epsilon-greedy exploration, a revised terminal solver and the integration of domain knowledge as constraints. In our evaluations, we use the CrazyAra engine on chess and crazyhouse as examples to show that these changes bring significant improvements to AlphaZero.			arxiv	['Patrick Korus', 'Kristian Kersting']	322.0

As demonstrated by the MuZero Algorithm, the environment model can even be learned dynamically, generalizing the agent to many more tasks while at the same time achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, MuZero uses internal state representations derived from real environment states for its predictions. In this paper, we bind the model's predicted internal state representation to the environment state via two additional terms: a reconstruction model loss and a simpler consistency loss, both of which work independently and unsupervised, acting as constraints to stabilize the learning process. Our experiments show that this new integration of reconstruction model loss and simpler consistency loss provide a significant performance increase in OpenAI Gym environments. Our modifications also enable self-supervised pretraining for MuZero, so the algorithm can learn about environment dynamics before a goal is made available.			arxiv	['Cornelius Weber', 'Muhammad Burhan Hafez', 'Stefan Wermter']	323.0

Previous work in the area of super-human game-play using AI has proven effective, with recent break-through for generic algorithms in games such as Go, Chess, and Shogi \cite{AlphaZero}. We directly apply these breakthroughs to a novel state-representation of TM with the goal of creating an AI that will rival human players. Specifically, we present the initial results of applying AlphaZero to this state-representation and analyze the strategies developed. A brief analysis is presented. We call this modified algorithm with our novel state-representation AlphaTM. In the end, we discuss the success and shortcomings of this method by comparing against multiple baselines and typical human scores.

772	Visualizing MuZero Models	Joery A. de Vries	2021-02-25 15:25:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12924v2	MuZero, a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a value equivalent dynamics model, achieved state-of-the-art performance in Chess, Shogi and the game of Go. In contrast to standard forward dynamics models that predict a full next state, value equivalent models are trained to predict a future value, thereby emphasizing value relevant information in the representations. While value equivalent models have shown strong empirical success, there is no research yet that visualizes and investigates what types of representations these models actually learn. Therefore, in this paper we visualize the latent representation of MuZero agents. We find that action trajectories may diverge between observation embeddings and internal state transition dynamics, which could lead to instability during planning. Based on this insight, we propose two regularization techniques to stabilize MuZero's performance. Additionally, we provide an open-source implementation of MuZero along with an interactive visualizer of learned representations, which may aid further investigation of value equivalent algorithms.			arxiv	['Ken S.

773	Dual Monte Carlo Tree Search	Prashank Kadam	2021-03-21 23:34:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11517v2	AlphaZero, using a combination of Deep Neural Networks and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), has successfully trained reinforcement learning agents in a tabula-rasa way. The neural MCTS algorithm has been successful in finding near-optimal strategies for games through self-play. However, the AlphaZero algorithm has a significant drawback; it takes a long time to converge and requires high computational power due to complex neural networks for solving games like Chess, Go, Shogi, etc. Owing to this, it is very difficult to pursue neural MCTS research without cutting-edge hardware, which is a roadblock for many aspiring neural MCTS researchers. In this paper, we propose a new neural MCTS algorithm, called Dual MCTS, which helps overcome these drawbacks. Dual MCTS uses two different search trees, a single deep neural network, and a new update technique for the search trees using a combination of the PUCB, a sliding-window, and the epsilon-greedy algorithm. This technique is applicable to any MCTS based algorithm to reduce the number of updates to the tree. We show that Dual MCTS performs better than one of the most widely used neural MCTS algorithms, AlphaZero, for various symmetric and asymmetric games.			arxiv	['Ruiyang Xu', 'Karl Lieberherr']	326.0
774	Saved by the rook: a case of matchings and Hamiltonian cycles	Mari√©n Abreu	2021-04-04 10:10:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01578v1	The rook graph is a graph whose edges represent all the possible legal moves of the rook chess piece on a chessboard. The problem we consider is the following. Given any set $M$ containing pairs of cells such that each cell of the $m_1 \times m_2$ chessboard is in exactly one pair, we determine the values of the positive integers $m_1$ and $m_2$ for which it is possible to construct a closed tour of all the cells of the chessboard which uses all the pairs of cells in $M$ and some edges of the rook graph. This is an alternative formulation of a graph-theoretical problem presented in [Electron. J. Combin. 28(1) (2021), #P1.7] involving the Cartesian product $G$ of two complete graphs $K_{m_1}$ and $K_{m_2}$, which is, in fact, isomorphic to the $m_{1}\times m_{2}$ rook graph. The problem revolves around determining the values of the parameters $m_1$ and $m_2$ that would allow any perfect matching of the complete graph on the same vertex set of $G$ to be extended to a Hamiltonian cycle by using only edges in $G$.			arxiv	['John Baptist Gauci', 'Jean Paul Zerafa']	327.0
775	Compact Variable-Gap Undulator with Hydraulic-Assist Driver: undulator harmonic energy scan test	Alexander Temnykh	2021-04-06 13:30:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02500v1	In the compact variable-gap undulator with Hydraulic-Assist Driver, miniature hydraulic cylinders compensate for ~90% of magnetic forces and mechanical actuators are used to accurately control the undulator gap. This method of hydraulic assist enables design simplicity and compactness of the undulator. Proof-of-concept experiments and test results of the undulator prototype in step-by-step motion mode indicated excellent accuracy and stability properties of the driver. In this note we present test results of hydraulic-assist driver in continuous motion mode. Results indicate that hydraulic-assist driver can provide smooth continuous undulator gap change, keeping the undulator harmonic energy variation within the required 1eV/sec, and speed and RMS normalized energy errors at 1.8e-4 level (or less). That satisfies any application planned at CHESS.			arxiv	['Ivan Temnykh']	328.0
776	On the Power of Refined Skat Selection	Stefan Edelkamp	2021-04-07 08:54:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02997v1	Skat is a fascinating combinatorial card game, show-casing many of the intrinsic challenges for modern AI systems such as cooperative and adversarial behaviors (among the players), randomness (in the deal), and partial knowledge (due to hidden cards). Given the larger number of tricks and higher degree of uncertainty, reinforcement learning is less effective compared to classical board games like Chess and Go. As within the game of Bridge, in Skat we have a bidding and trick-taking stage. Prior to the trick-taking and as part of the bidding process, one phase in the game is to select two skat cards, whose quality may influence subsequent playing performance drastically. This paper looks into different skat selection strategies. Besides predicting the probability of winning and other hand strength functions we propose hard expert-rules and a scoring functions based on refined skat evaluation features. Experiments emphasize the impact of the refined skat putting algorithm on the playing performance of the bots, especially for AI bidding and AI game selection.			arxiv	[]	329.0
777	Elo Ratings for Large Tournaments of Software Agents in Asymmetric Games	Ben Wise	2021-04-23 21:49:20	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00839v1	The Elo rating system has been used world wide for individual sports and team sports, as exemplified by the European Go Federation (EGF), International Chess Federation (FIDE), International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), and many others. To evaluate the performance of artificial intelligence agents, it is natural to evaluate them on the same Elo scale as humans, such as the rating of 5185 attributed to AlphaGo Zero. There are several fundamental differences between humans and AI that suggest modifications to the system, which in turn require revisiting Elo's fundamental rationale. AI is typically trained on many more games than humans play, and we have little a-priori information on newly created AI agents. Further, AI is being extended into games which are asymmetric between the players, and which could even have large complex boards with different setup in every game, such as commercial paper strategy games. We present a revised rating system, and guidelines for tournaments, to reflect these differences.			arxiv	[]	330.0

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents proved to be to a force to be reckon with in many complex games like Chess and Go. We can look at the stock market historical price series and movements as a complex imperfect information environment in which we try to maximize return - profit and minimize risk. This paper reviews the progress made so far with deep reinforcement learning in the subdomain of AI in finance, more precisely, automated low-frequency quantitative stock trading. Many of the reviewed studies had only proof-of-concept ideals with experiments conducted in unrealistic settings and no real-time trading applications. For the majority of the works, despite all showing statistically significant improvements in performance compared to established baseline strategies, no decent profitability level was obtained. Furthermore, there is a lack of experimental testing in real-time, online trading platforms and a lack of meaningful comparisons between agents built on different types of DRL or human traders. We conclude that DRL in stock trading has showed huge applicability potential rivalling professional traders under strong assumptions, but the research is still in the very early stages of development.			arxiv	[]	331.0

However, such successes have been limited to deterministic fully-observed environments. We present a new approach that handles stochastic and partially-observable environments. Our key insight is to use discrete autoencoders to capture the multiple possible effects of an action in a stochastic environment. We use a stochastic variant of Monte Carlo tree search to plan over both the agent's actions and the discrete latent variables representing the environment's response. Our approach significantly outperforms an offline version of MuZero on a stochastic interpretation of chess where the opponent is considered part of the environment. We also show that our approach scales to DeepMind Lab, a first-person 3D environment with large visual observations and partial observability.			arxiv	['Yazhe Li', 'Ali Razavi', 'Ioannis Antonoglou', 'A√§ron van den Oord', 'Oriol Vinyals']	332.0

Here, we investigate water quality time series (such as dissolved oxygen concentrations and electrical conductivity) as measured in rivers, and provide evidence that they exhibit superstatistical behaviour. Our main example are time series as recorded in the river Chess in South East England. Specifically, we use seasonal detrending and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to separate trends from fluctuations for the measured data. With either detrending method, we observe heavy-tailed fluctuation distributions, which are well described by a log-normal superstatistics for dissolved oxygen. Contrarily, we find a double peaked non-standard superstatistics for the electrical conductivity data, which we model using two combined $\chi^2$-distributions.			arxiv	['Catherine M.

781	The correlation coefficient between citation metrics and winning a Nobel or Abel Prize	M. V. Simkin	2021-09-13 21:20:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06329v1	Computing such correlation coefficient would be straightforward had we had available the rankings given by the prize committee to all scientists in the pool. In reality we only have citation rankings for all scientists. This means, however, that we have the ordinal rankings of the prize winners with regard to citation metrics. I use maximum likelihood method to infer the most probable correlation coefficient to produce the observed pattern of ordinal ranks of the prize winners. I get the correlation coefficients of 0.47 and 0.59 between the composite citation indicator and getting Abel Prize and Fields Medal, respectively. The correlation coefficient between getting a Nobel Prize and the Q-factor is 0.65. These coefficients are of the same magnitude as the correlation coefficient between Elo ratings of the chess players and their popularity measured as numbers of webpages mentioning the players.			arxiv	[]	334.0
782	An Elo-type rating model for players and teams of variable strength	D√ºring Bertram	2021-09-28 12:30:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15046v2	The Elo rating system, which was originally proposed by Arpad Elo for chess, has become one of the most important rating systems in sports, economics and gaming nowadays. Its original formulation is based on two-player zero-sum games, but it has been adapted for team sports and other settings. In 2015, Junca and Jabin proposed a kinetic version of the Elo model, and showed that under certain assumptions the ratings do converge towards the players' strength. In this paper we generalise their model to account for variable performance of individual players or teams. We discuss the underlying modelling assumptions, derive the respective formal mean-field model and illustrate the dynamics with computational results.			arxiv	['Fischer Michael', 'Wolfram Marie-Therese']	335.0
783	Reinforcement Learning with Information-Theoretic Actuation	Elliot Catt	2021-09-30 14:10:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15147v1	Reinforcement Learning formalises an embodied agent's interaction with the environment through observations, rewards and actions. But where do the actions come from? Actions are often considered to represent something external, such as the movement of a limb, a chess piece, or more generally, the output of an actuator. In this work we explore and formalize a contrasting view, namely that actions are best thought of as the output of a sequence of internal choices with respect to an action model. This view is particularly well-suited for leveraging the recent advances in large sequence models as prior knowledge for multi-task reinforcement learning problems. Our main contribution in this work is to show how to augment the standard MDP formalism with a sequential notion of internal action using information-theoretic techniques, and that this leads to self-consistent definitions of both internal and external action value functions.			arxiv	['Marcus Hutter', 'Joel Veness']	336.0

However, the search methods used in these games, and in many other settings, are tabular. Tabular search methods do not scale well with the size of the search space, and this problem is exacerbated by stochasticity and partial observability. In this work we replace tabular search with online model-based fine-tuning of a policy neural network via reinforcement learning, and show that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art search algorithms in benchmark settings. In particular, we use our search algorithm to achieve a new state-of-the-art result in self-play Hanabi, and show the generality of our algorithm by also showing that it outperforms tabular search in the Atari game Ms. Pacman.			arxiv	['Hengyuan Hu', 'Brandon Amos', 'Stuart Russell', 'Noam Brown']	337.0

Imitation learning is effective at predicting human actions but may not match the strength of expert humans, while self-play learning and search techniques (e.g. AlphaZero) lead to strong performance but may produce policies that are difficult for humans to understand and coordinate with. We show in chess and Go that regularizing search based on the KL divergence from an imitation-learned policy results in higher human prediction accuracy and stronger performance than imitation learning alone. We then introduce a novel regret minimization algorithm that is regularized based on the KL divergence from an imitation-learned policy, and show that using this algorithm for search in no-press Diplomacy yields a policy that matches the human prediction accuracy of imitation learning while being substantially stronger.			arxiv	['David J.

786	Learning to Identify Top Elo Ratings: A Dueling Bandits Approach	Xue Yan	2022-01-12 13:57:29	http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04480v2	The Elo rating system is widely adopted to evaluate the skills of (chess) game and sports players. Recently it has been also integrated into machine learning algorithms in evaluating the performance of computerised AI agents. However, an accurate estimation of the Elo rating (for the top players) often requires many rounds of competitions, which can be expensive to carry out. In this paper, to improve the sample efficiency of the Elo evaluation (for top players), we propose an efficient online match scheduling algorithm. Specifically, we identify and match the top players through a dueling bandits framework and tailor the bandit algorithm to the gradient-based update of Elo. We show that it reduces the per-step memory and time complexity to constant, compared to the traditional likelihood maximization approaches requiring $O(t)$ time. Our algorithm has a regret guarantee of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$, sublinear in the number of competition rounds and has been extended to the multidimensional Elo ratings for handling intransitive games. We empirically demonstrate that our method achieves superior convergence speed and time efficiency on a variety of gaming tasks.			arxiv	['Yali Du', 'Binxin Ru', 'Jun Wang', 'Haifeng Zhang', 'Xu Chen']	339.0
787	Infinite Hex is a draw	Joel David Hamkins	2022-01-17 15:37:16	http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06475v3	We introduce the game of infinite Hex, extending the familiar finite game to natural play on the infinite hexagonal lattice. Whereas the finite game is a win for the first player, we prove in contrast that infinite Hex is a draw -- both players have drawing strategies. Meanwhile, the transfinite game-value phenomenon, now abundantly exhibited in infinite chess and infinite draughts, regrettably does not arise in infinite Hex; only finite game values occur. Indeed, every game-valued position in infinite Hex is intrinsically local, meaning that winning play depends only on a fixed finite region of the board. This latter fact is proved under very general hypotheses, establishing the conclusion for all simple stone-placing games.			arxiv	['Davide Leonessi']	340.0
788	Imitation Learning by Estimating Expertise of Demonstrators	Mark Beliaev	2022-02-02 21:23:19	http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01288v2	Many existing imitation learning datasets are collected from multiple demonstrators, each with different expertise at different parts of the environment. Yet, standard imitation learning algorithms typically treat all demonstrators as homogeneous, regardless of their expertise, absorbing the weaknesses of any suboptimal demonstrators. In this work, we show that unsupervised learning over demonstrator expertise can lead to a consistent boost in the performance of imitation learning algorithms. We develop and optimize a joint model over a learned policy and expertise levels of the demonstrators. This enables our model to learn from the optimal behavior and filter out the suboptimal behavior of each demonstrator. Our model learns a single policy that can outperform even the best demonstrator, and can be used to estimate the expertise of any demonstrator at any state. We illustrate our findings on real-robotic continuous control tasks from Robomimic and discrete environments such as MiniGrid and chess, out-performing competing methods in $21$ out of $23$ settings, with an average of $7\%$ and up to $60\%$ improvement in terms of the final reward.			arxiv	['Andy Shih', 'Stefano Ermon', 'Dorsa Sadigh', 'Ramtin Pedarsani']	341.0

Senkevich	2022-01-30 14:06:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03155v1	"As is known, AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), unlike AI, should operate with meanings. And that's what distinguishes it from AI. Any successful AI implementations (playing chess, unmanned driving, face recognition etc.) do not operate with the meanings of the processed objects in any way and do not recognize the meaning. And they don't need to. But for AGI, which emulates human thinking, this ability is crucial. Numerous attempts to define the concept of ""meaning"" have one very significant drawback - all such definitions are not strict and formalized, so they cannot be programmed. The meaning search procedure should use a formalized description of its existence and possible forms of its perception. For the practical implementation of AGI, it is necessary to develop such ""ready-to-code"" descriptions in the context of their use for processing the related cognitive concepts of ""meaning"" and ""knowledge"". An attempt to formalize the definition of such concepts is made in this article."			arxiv	[]	342.0

It allows a player in a game to believe that her opponent may be either less or as sophisticated as, she is, a view supported in psychology. We apply NLK to data from five published papers on static, dynamic, and auction games. NLK provides different predictions than those of the NE and Level-K; moreover, a simple version of NLK explains the experimental data better in many cases, with the same or lower number of parameters. We discuss extensions to games with more than two players and heterogeneous beliefs.			arxiv	['Luyao Zhang']	343.0
791	Review of Metrics to Measure the Stability, Robustness and Resilience of Reinforcement Learning	Laura L. Pullum	2022-03-22 21:15:01	http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12048v1	Reinforcement learning has received significant interest in recent years, due primarily to the successes of deep reinforcement learning at solving many challenging tasks such as playing Chess, Go and online computer games. However, with the increasing focus on reinforcement learning, applications outside of gaming and simulated environments require understanding the robustness, stability, and resilience of reinforcement learning methods. To this end, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to characterize the available literature on these three behaviors as they pertain to reinforcement learning. We classify the quantitative and theoretical approaches used to indicate or measure robustness, stability, and resilience behaviors. In addition, we identified the action or event to which the quantitative approaches were attempting to be stable, robust, or resilient. Finally, we provide a decision tree useful for selecting metrics to quantify the behaviors. We believe that this is the first comprehensive review of stability, robustness and resilience specifically geared towards reinforcement learning.			arxiv	[]	344.0
792	Becoming the World's Highest Rated Chess Player	Rikhav Shah	2022-03-28 08:19:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14567v1	The Elo rating system measures the approximate skill of each competitor in a game or sport. As a competitor competes, their rating changes based on their wins and losses. Increasing one's rating can be difficult work; one must hone their skills and consistently beat the competition. Alternatively, with enough money you can rig the outcome of games to boost your rating. Say you manage to get together $n$ people (including yourself) and acquire enough money to rig $k$ games. How high can you get your rating? The people you gathered aren't very interested in the game, and will only play if you pay them to. We resolve this question for $n=2$ and $n=\Omega(k^{1/3})$ (up to a log factor) for the standard Elo system, and provide close upper and lower bounds for a wider class of rating systems that resemble Elo.			arxiv	[]	345.0
793	Challenges to Solving Combinatorially Hard Long-Horizon Deep RL Tasks	Andrew C. Li	2022-06-03 20:38:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01812v1	Deep reinforcement learning has shown promise in discrete domains requiring complex reasoning, including games such as Chess, Go, and Hanabi. However, this type of reasoning is less often observed in long-horizon, continuous domains with high-dimensional observations, where instead RL research has predominantly focused on problems with simple high-level structure (e.g. opening a drawer or moving a robot as fast as possible). Inspired by combinatorially hard optimization problems, we propose a set of robotics tasks which admit many distinct solutions at the high-level, but require reasoning about states and rewards thousands of steps into the future for the best performance. Critically, while RL has traditionally suffered on complex, long-horizon tasks due to sparse rewards, our tasks are carefully designed to be solvable without specialized exploration. Nevertheless, our investigation finds that standard RL methods often neglect long-term effects due to discounting, while general-purpose hierarchical RL approaches struggle unless additional abstract domain knowledge can be exploited.			arxiv	['Pashootan Vaezipoor', 'Rodrigo Toro Icarte', 'Sheila A.

794	On the Limitations of Elo: Real-World Games, are Transitive, not Additive	Quentin Bertrand	2022-06-21 22:07:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12301v3	Real-world competitive games, such as chess, go, or StarCraft II, rely on Elo models to measure the strength of their players. Since these games are not fully transitive, using Elo implicitly assumes they have a strong transitive component that can correctly be identified and extracted. In this study, we investigate the challenge of identifying the strength of the transitive component in games. First, we show that Elo models can fail to extract this transitive component, even in elementary transitive games. Then, based on this observation, we propose an extension of the Elo score: we end up with a disc ranking system that assigns each player two scores, which we refer to as skill and consistency. Finally, we propose an empirical validation on payoff matrices coming from real-world games played by bots and humans.			arxiv	['Wojciech Marian Czarnecki', 'Gauthier Gidel']	347.0

Thompson	2022-06-28 13:50:04	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14007v1	"Denizens of Silicon Valley have called Moore's Law ""the most important graph in human history,"" and economists have found that Moore's Law-powered I.T. revolution has been one of the most important sources of national productivity growth. But data substantiating these claims tend to either be abstracted - for example by examining spending on I.T., rather than I.T. itself - or anecdotal. In this paper, we assemble direct quantitative evidence of the impact that computing power has had on five domains: two computing bellwethers (Chess and Go), and three economically important applications (weather prediction, protein folding, and oil exploration). Computing power explains 49%-94% of the performance improvements in these domains. But whereas economic theory typically assumes a power-law relationship between inputs and outputs, we find that an exponential increase in computing power is needed to get linear improvements in these outcomes. This helps clarify why the exponential growth of computing power from Moore's Law has been so important for progress, and why performance improvements across many domains are becoming economically tenuous as Moore's Law breaks down."			arxiv	['Shuning Ge', 'Gabriel F.

Extensive-form games is a general concept of games such as Go, Shogi, and chess, which have triggered the recent AI revolution, and is the basis for many important game theoretic models in economics. Quantum transitions allow for pairwise annihilation of paths in the quantum game tree, resulting in a probability distribution that is more likely to produce a particular outcome. This is similar in principle to the mechanism of speed-up by quantum computation represented by Grover's algorithm. A quantum extensive-form game is also a generalization of quantum learning, including Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks. As an new example of quantum extensive-form games, we propose a quantum form of the Angel problem originally proposed by Conway in 1996. The classical problem has been solved but by quantizing it, the game becomes non-trivial.			arxiv	[]	350.0

The anisotropic etching of silicon facilitates the creation of custom gratings that have sharp and atomically smooth facets, directly addressing these issues. We describe work to fabricate and characterize etched silicon echelles optimized for the far ultraviolet (FUV; 90 - 180 nm) bandpass. We fabricate two echelles that have similar parameters to the mechanically ruled grating flown on the CHESS sounding rocket. We demonstrate a 42% increase in peak order efficiency and an 83% decrease in interorder scatter using these gratings. We also present analysis on where the remaining efficiency resides. These demonstrated FUV echelle improvements benefit the faint source sensitivity and high-resolution performance of future UV observatories.			arxiv	['Drew M.

However, in many practical applications, such as poker, chess, evader pursuing, drug interdiction, coast guard, cyber-security, and national defense, players often have apparently adversarial stances, that is, selfish actions of each player inevitably or intentionally inflict loss or wreak havoc on other players. Along this line, this paper provides a systematic survey on three main game models widely employed in adversarial games, i.e., zero-sum normal-form and extensive-form games, Stackelberg (security) games, zero-sum differential games, from an array of perspectives, including basic knowledge of game models, (approximate) equilibrium concepts, problem classifications, research frontiers, (approximate) optimal strategy seeking techniques, prevailing algorithms, and practical applications.

It's among the most important problems in graph theory, as well as an NP-Complete problem that can't be solved in polynomial time. As a result, we describe a new hybrid cuckoo search technique to tackle the MDS problem in this work. Cuckoo search is a well-known metaheuristic famed for its capacity for exploring a large area of the search space, making it useful for diversification. However, to enhance performance, we incorporated intensification techniques in addition to the genetic crossover operator in the suggested approach. The comparison of our method with the corresponding state-of-the-art techniques from the literature is presented in an exhaustive experimental test. The suggested algorithm outperforms the present state of the art, according to the obtained results.			arxiv	['Sadek Bouroubi']	353.0

B√©la J√≥n√°s	2022-08-17 17:14:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08414v1	A partial Latin square of order $n$ can be represented by a $3$-dimensional chess-board of size $n\times n\times n$ with at most $n^2$ non-attacking rooks. Based on this representation, we apply a uniform method to prove the M. Hall's, Ryser's and Cruse's theorems for completion of partial Latin squares. With the help of this proof, we extend the scope of Cruse's theorem to compact bricks, which appear to be independent of their environment. Without losing any completion you can replace a dot by a rook if the dot must become rook, or you can eliminate the dots that are known not to become rooks. Therefore, we introduce primary and secondary extension procedures that are repeated as many times as possible. If the procedures do not decide whether a PLSC can be completed or not, a new necessary condition for completion can be formulated for the dot structure of the resulting PLSC, the BUG condition.			arxiv	[]	354.0

We have also computed new values for classical queen domination problems on chessboards (square polyominoes). For our computations, we have translated the problem into an integer linear programming instance. Finally, using this computational implementation and the game engine Godot, we have developed a video game of minimal domination of queens and rooks on randomly generated polyominoes.			arxiv	['Christoph M√º√üig', '√ârika R√≥ldan']	355.0
803	Influence of cumulative damage on synchronization of Kuramoto oscillators on networks	Leidy Katherin Eraso Hern√°ndez	2022-12-16 16:53:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08576v2	In this paper, we study the synchronization of identical Kuramoto phase oscillators under cumulative stochastic damage to the edges of networks. We analyze the capacity of coupled oscillators to reach a coherent state from initial random phases. The process of synchronization is a global function performed by a system that gradually changes when the damage weakens individual connections of the network. We explore diverse structures characterized by different topologies. Among these are deterministic networks as a wheel or the lattice formed by the movements of the knight on a chess board, and random networks generated with the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and Barab\'asi-Albert algorithms. In addition, we study the synchronization times of 109 non-isomorphic graphs with six nodes. The synchronization times and other introduced quantities are sensitive to the impact of damage, allowing us to measure the reduction of the capacity of synchronization and classify the effect of damage in the systems under study. This approach is general and paves the way for the exploration of the effect of damage accumulation in diverse dynamical processes in complex systems.			arxiv	['Alejandro P. Riascos']	356.0
804	BQP $=$ PSPACE	Shibdas Roy	2023-01-24 07:52:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10557v2	The complexity class $PSPACE$ includes all computational problems that can be solved by a classical computer with polynomial memory. All $PSPACE$ problems are known to be solvable by a quantum computer too with polynomial memory and are, thus, known to be in $BQPSPACE$. Here, we present a polynomial time quantum algorithm for a $PSPACE$-complete problem, implying that $PSPACE$ is equal to the class $BQP$ of all problems solvable by a quantum computer in polynomial time. In particular, we outline a $BQP$ algorithm for the $PSPACE$-complete problem of evaluating a full binary $NAND$ tree. An existing best of quadratic speedup is achieved using quantum walks for this problem, so that the complexity is still exponential in the problem size. By contrast, we achieve an exponential speedup for the problem, allowing for solving it in polynomial time. There are many real-world applications of our result, such as strategy games like chess or Go. As an example, in quantum sensing, the problem of quantum illumination, that is treated as that of channel discrimination, is $PSPACE$-complete. Our work implies that quantum channel discrimination, and so, quantum illumination, can be performed efficiently by a quantum computer.			arxiv	[]	357.0
805	CCDN: Checkerboard Corner Detection Network for Robust Camera Calibration	Ben Chen	2023-02-10 07:47:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05097v1	Aiming to improve the checkerboard corner detection robustness against the images with poor quality, such as lens distortion, extreme poses, and noise, we propose a novel detection algorithm which can maintain high accuracy on inputs under multiply scenarios without any prior knowledge of the checkerboard pattern. This whole algorithm includes a checkerboard corner detection network and some post-processing techniques. The network model is a fully convolutional network with improvements of loss function and learning rate, which can deal with the images of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with a corner score on each pixel by efficient inference and learning. Besides, in order to remove the false positives, we employ three post-processing techniques including threshold related to maximum response, non-maximum suppression, and clustering. Evaluations on two different datasets show its superior robustness, accuracy and wide applicability in quantitative comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods, like MATE, ChESS, ROCHADE and OCamCalib.			arxiv	['Caihua Xiong', 'Qi Zhang']	358.0
806	Bridging adaptive management and reinforcement learning for more robust decisions	Melissa Chapman	2023-03-15 16:14:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08731v1	From out-competing grandmasters in chess to informing high-stakes healthcare decisions, emerging methods from artificial intelligence are increasingly capable of making complex and strategic decisions in diverse, high-dimensional, and uncertain situations. But can these methods help us devise robust strategies for managing environmental systems under great uncertainty? Here we explore how reinforcement learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, approaches decision problems through a lens similar to adaptive environmental management: learning through experience to gradually improve decisions with updated knowledge. We review where reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for improving evidence-informed adaptive management decisions even when classical optimization methods are intractable. For example, model-free deep RL might help identify quantitative decision strategies even when models are nonidentifiable. Finally, we discuss technical and social issues that arise when applying reinforcement learning to adaptive management problems in the environmental domain. Our synthesis suggests that environmental management and computer science can learn from one another about the practices, promises, and perils of experience-based decision-making.			arxiv	['Lily Xu', 'Marcus Lapeyrolerie', 'Carl Boettiger']	359.0

By leveraging JAX's auto-vectorization and parallelization over accelerators, Pgx can efficiently scale to thousands of simultaneous simulations over accelerators. In our experiments on a DGX-A100 workstation, we discovered that Pgx can simulate RL environments 10-100x faster than existing implementations available in Python. Pgx includes RL environments commonly used as benchmarks in RL research, such as backgammon, chess, shogi, and Go. Additionally, Pgx offers miniature game sets and baseline models to facilitate rapid research cycles. We demonstrate the efficient training of the Gumbel AlphaZero algorithm with Pgx environments. Overall, Pgx provides high-performance environment simulators for researchers to accelerate their RL experiments.

However, most classical use cases only feature up to two players. Scaling the search to an arbitrary number of players presents a computational challenge, especially if decisions have to be planned over a longer time horizon. In this work, we investigate techniques that transform general-sum multiplayer games into single-player and two-player games that consider other agents to act according to given opponent models. For our evaluation, we focus on the challenging Pommerman environment which involves partial observability, a long time horizon and sparse rewards. In combination with our search methods, we investigate the phenomena of opponent modeling using heuristics and self-play. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our multiplayer search variants both in a supervised learning and reinforcement learning setting.			arxiv	['Johannes Czech', 'Tobias Meuser', 'Kristian Kersting']	361.0

By analyzing over 10,000 records of human Xiangqi play, we highlight the existence of both transitive and non-transitive elements within the game's strategic structure. To address non-transitivity, we introduce the JiangJun algorithm, an innovative combination of Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) designed to approximate a Nash equilibrium. We evaluate the algorithm empirically using a WeChat mini program and achieve a Master level with a 99.41\% win rate against human players. The algorithm's effectiveness in overcoming non-transitivity is confirmed by a plethora of metrics, such as relative population performance and visualization results.

Initially designed for the game of Go, this revolutionary algorithm merges deep learning techniques with the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to surpass earlier top-tier methods. In our study, we broaden the use of AlphaZero to Gomoku, an age-old tactical board game also referred to as ""Five in a Row."" Intriguingly, Gomoku has innate challenges due to a bias towards the initial player, who has a theoretical advantage. To add value, we strive for a balanced game-play. Our tests demonstrate AlphaZero's versatility in adapting to games other than Go. MCTS has become a predominant algorithm for decision processes in intricate scenarios, especially board games. MCTS creates a search tree by examining potential future actions and uses random sampling to predict possible results. By leveraging the best of both worlds, the AlphaZero technique fuses deep learning from Reinforcement Learning with the balancing act of MCTS, establishing a fresh standard in game-playing AI. Its triumph is notably evident in board games such as Go, chess, and shogi."			arxiv	['Chao Yu', 'Brian Whiteaker', 'Inyoung Huh', 'Hua Shao', 'Youzhi Liang']	363.0

The advancement of AI-driven tutoring systems for facilitating human learning requires an understanding of the impact of evaluative feedback on human decision-making and skill development. To this end, we conduct human experiments using Amazon Mechanical Turk to study the influence of evaluative feedback on human decision-making in sequential tasks. In these experiments, participants solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle and receive AI-generated feedback while solving it. We examine how this feedback affects their learning and skill transfer to related tasks. We also explore various computational models to understand how people incorporate evaluative feedback into their decision-making processes.			arxiv	['Subir Biswas', 'Vaibhav Srivastava']	364.0
812	From Images to Connections: Can DQN with GNNs learn the Strategic Game of Hex?	Yannik Keller	2023-11-22 14:20:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13414v1	The gameplay of strategic board games such as chess, Go and Hex is often characterized by combinatorial, relational structures -- capturing distinct interactions and non-local patterns -- and not just images. Nonetheless, most common self-play reinforcement learning (RL) approaches simply approximate policy and value functions using convolutional neural networks (CNN). A key feature of CNNs is their relational inductive bias towards locality and translational invariance. In contrast, graph neural networks (GNN) can encode more complicated and distinct relational structures. Hence, we investigate the crucial question: Can GNNs, with their ability to encode complex connections, replace CNNs in self-play reinforcement learning? To this end, we do a comparison with Hex -- an abstract yet strategically rich board game -- serving as our experimental platform. Our findings reveal that GNNs excel at dealing with long range dependency situations in game states and are less prone to overfitting, but also showing a reduced proficiency in discerning local patterns. This suggests a potential paradigm shift, signaling the use of game-specific structures to reshape self-play reinforcement learning.			arxiv	['Jannis Bl√ºml', 'Gopika Sudhakaran', 'Kristian Kersting']	365.0

However, while popular, the system's suitability for assessing entities with constant skill levels, such as LLMs, remains relatively unexplored. We study two fundamental axioms that evaluation methods should adhere to: reliability and transitivity. We conduct extensive evaluation of Elo behaviour, illustrating that individual Elo computations exhibit volatility and delving into the impact of varying the Elo rating system's hyperparameters. We show that these axioms are not always satisfied raising questions about the reliability of current comparative evaluations of LLMs. If the current use of Elo scores is intended to substitute the costly head-to-head comparison of LLMs, it is crucial to ensure the ranking is as robust as possible. Guided by the axioms, our findings offer concrete guidelines for enhancing the reliability of LLM evaluation methods, suggesting a need for reassessment of existing comparative approaches."			arxiv	['Edward Kim', 'Beyza Ermis', 'Sara Hooker', 'Marzieh Fadaee']	366.0
814	Modeling Boundedly Rational Agents with Latent Inference Budgets	Athul Paul Jacob	2023-12-07 03:55:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04030v1	We study the problem of modeling a population of agents pursuing unknown goals subject to unknown computational constraints. In standard models of bounded rationality, sub-optimal decision-making is simulated by adding homoscedastic noise to optimal decisions rather than explicitly simulating constrained inference. In this work, we introduce a latent inference budget model (L-IBM) that models agents' computational constraints explicitly, via a latent variable (inferred jointly with a model of agents' goals) that controls the runtime of an iterative inference algorithm. L-IBMs make it possible to learn agent models using data from diverse populations of suboptimal actors. In three modeling tasks -- inferring navigation goals from routes, inferring communicative intents from human utterances, and predicting next moves in human chess games -- we show that L-IBMs match or outperform Boltzmann models of decision-making under uncertainty. Inferred inference budgets are themselves meaningful, efficient to compute, and correlated with measures of player skill, partner skill and task difficulty.			arxiv	['Abhishek Gupta', 'Jacob Andreas']	367.0
815	Exploring Parity Challenges in Reinforcement Learning through Curriculum Learning with Noisy Labels	Bei Zhou	2023-12-08 21:32:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05379v1	This paper delves into applying reinforcement learning (RL) in strategy games, particularly those characterized by parity challenges, as seen in specific positions of Go and Chess and a broader range of impartial games. We propose a simulated learning process, structured within a curriculum learning framework and augmented with noisy labels, to mirror the intricacies of self-play learning scenarios. This approach thoroughly analyses how neural networks (NNs) adapt and evolve from elementary to increasingly complex game positions. Our empirical research indicates that even minimal label noise can significantly impede NNs' ability to discern effective strategies, a difficulty that intensifies with the growing complexity of the game positions. These findings underscore the urgent need for advanced methodologies in RL training, specifically tailored to counter the obstacles imposed by noisy evaluations. The development of such methodologies is crucial not only for enhancing NN proficiency in strategy games with significant parity elements but also for broadening the resilience and efficiency of RL systems across diverse and complex environments.			arxiv	['Soren Riis']	368.0

Estimation of ranks based on point estimates of means does not account for the uncertainty in those estimates. Treating estimated ranks without regard for uncertainty is problematic. We propose a Bayesian solution. It is competitive with recent frequentist methods, and more effective and informative, and is as easy to implement as it is to compute the posterior means and variances of the entity means. Using credible sets, we created novel credible distributions for the rank vector of the entities. We evaluate the Bayesian procedure in terms of accuracy and stability in two applications and a simulation study. Frequentist approaches cannot take account of covariates, but the Bayesian method handles them easily.			arxiv	['Yiren Hou', 'Abhyuday Mandal']	369.0

The bright bowshock B1 in the southern outflow lobe is a privileged testbed of magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) shock models, for which dynamical and chemical processes are strongly interdependent. We present the first results of the unbiased spectral survey of the L1157-B1 bowshock, obtained in the framework of the key program ""Chemical Herschel Surveys of Star Forming Regions"" (CHESS). The main aim is to trace the warm and chemically enriched gas and to infer the excitation conditions in the shock region. The CO 5-4 and H2O lines have been detected at high-spectral resolution in the unbiased spectral survey of the HIFI-Band 1b spectral window (555-636 GHz), presented by Codella et al. in this volume. Complementary ground-based observations in the submm window help establish the origin of the emission detected in the main-beam of HIFI, and the physical conditions in the shock.}{Both lines exhibit broad wings, which extend to velocities much higher than reported up to now. We find that the molecular emission arises from two regions with distinct physical conditions: an extended, warm (100K), dense (3e5 cm-3) component at low-velocity, which dominates the water line flux in Band~1; a secondary component in a small region of B1 (a few arcsec) associated with high-velocity, hot (> 400 K) gas of moderate density ((1.0-3.0)e4 cm-3), which appears to dominate the flux of the water line at 179mu observed with PACS. The water abundance is enhanced by two orders of magnitude between the low- and the high-velocity component, from 8e-7 up to 8e-5. The properties of the high-velocity component agree well with the predictions of steady-state C-shock models."			arxiv	['S. Cabrit', 'C. Codella', 'G. Melnick', 'J. Cernicharo', 'E. Caux', 'M.

818	The reconstruction of Rh(001) upon oxygen adsorption	Dario Alfe`	1998-04-03 10:18:55	http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9804031v1	We report on a first-principles study of the structure of O/Rh(001) at half a monolayer of oxygen coverage, performed using density-functional theory. We find that oxygen atoms sit at the center of the black squares of a chess-board, $c(2\times 2)$, pattern. This structure is unstable against a rhomboid distortion of the black squares, which shortens the distance between an O atom and two of the four neighboring Rh atoms, while lengthening the distance with respect to the other two. We actually find that the surface energy is further lowered by allowing the O atom to get off the short diagonal of the rhombus so formed. We predict that the latter distortion is associated with an order-disorder transition, occurring below room temperature. The above rhomboid distortion of the square lattice may be seen as a rotation of the empty, white, squares. Our findings are at variance with recent claims based on STM images, according to which it is instead the black squares which would rotate. We argue that these images are indeed compatible with our predicted reconstruction pattern.			arxiv	['Stefano de Gironcoli', 'Stefano Baroni']	371.0

Rozikov	2004-09-03 10:39:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0409047v1	We consider a nearest-neighbor SOS model, spin values $0,1,..., m$, $m\geq 2$, on a Cayley tree of order $k$ . We mainly assume that $m=2$ and study translation-invariant (TI) and `splitting' (S) Gibbs measures (GMs). For $m=2$, in the anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) case, a symmetric TISGM is unique for all temperatures. In the ferromagnetic (FM) case, for $m=2$, the number of symmetric TISGMs varies with the temperature: here we identify a critical inverse temperature, $\beta^1_{\rm{cr}}$ ($=T_{\rm{cr}}^{\rm{STISG}}$) $\in (0,\infty)$ such that $\forall$ $0\leq \beta\leq\beta^1_{\rm{cr}}$, there exists a unique symmetric TISGM $\mu^*$ and $\forall$ $\beta >\beta^1_{\rm{cr}}$ there are exactly three symmetric TISGMs : $\mu^*_+$, $\mu^*_{\rm m}$ and $\mu^*_-$ For $\beta>\beta^1_{\rm{cr}}$ we also construct a continuum of distinct, symmertric SGMs which are non-TI. Our second result gives complete description of the set of periodic Gibbs measures for the SOS model on a Cayley tree. We show that (i) for an FM SOS model, for any normal subgroup of finite index, each periodic SGM is in fact TI. Further, (ii) for an AFM SOS model, for any normal subgroup of finite index, each periodic SGM is either TI or has period two (i.e., is a chess-board SGM).			arxiv	['Yu. M. Suhov']	372.0

On Photons, Bugs and Chess Players	Petr Hajicek	2006-08-28 23:51:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0608275v3	Free will is an old philosophical enigma that has been recently revived by neuropsychology. We restrict ourselves to the problem that determinism seems to allow only an illusion of freedom but random decissions do not contain any freedom either. We show that this is a problem of natural sciences, not philosophy. Physics motivates replacing determinism by the principle of weak causality and introducing the concept of liberty. Its empirical basis remains untouched, but the theoretical interpretations of the state space in Newton theory and of the space-time in general relativity are changed. The emerging understanding of time agrees with the idea suggested once by Popper. In biology, the most important liberties are those of mutation, of motion and of the portable neural representation. We distinguish freedom and liberty. Each freedom is associated with some liberty and is defined as the ability to perform three processes called realization, selection and use of memory. This makes freedom accessible to experimental study. The freedom of will is explained by giving account of the underlying specific liberty and processes. While the realization has an ample space for randomness, the selection is mostly causal. Thus, determinism can be rejected without forcing decissions to be random. The experiments of Libet and the role of consciousness are discussed.			arxiv	[]	373.0
821	Sparse Spike Coding : applications of Neuroscience to the processing of natural images	Laurent Perrinet	2008-04-30 15:15:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.4830v2	If modern computers are sometimes superior to humans in some specialized tasks such as playing chess or browsing a large database, they can't beat the efficiency of biological vision for such simple tasks as recognizing and following an object in a complex cluttered background. We present in this paper our attempt at outlining the dynamical, parallel and event-based representation for vision in the architecture of the central nervous system. We will illustrate this on static natural images by showing that in a signal matching framework, a L/LN (linear/non-linear) cascade may efficiently transform a sensory signal into a neural spiking signal and we will apply this framework to a model retina. However, this code gets redundant when using an over-complete basis as is necessary for modeling the primary visual cortex: we therefore optimize the efficiency cost by increasing the sparseness of the code. This is implemented by propagating and canceling redundant information using lateral interactions. We compare the efficiency of this representation in terms of compression as the reconstruction quality as a function of the coding length. This will correspond to a modification of the Matching Pursuit algorithm where the ArgMax function is optimized for competition, or Competition Optimized Matching Pursuit (COMP). We will in particular focus on bridging neuroscience and image processing and on the advantages of such an interdisciplinary approach.			arxiv	[]	374.0

Wang	2009-07-08 02:04:57	http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.1330v1	"The Space multi-band Variable Object Monitor (SVOM) is a proposed Chinese astronomical satellite, dedicated to the detection, localization and measurement of the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) on the cosmological scale. An efficient algorithm is developed for the purpose of onboard star extraction from the CCD images obtained with the Visible Telescope (VT) on board SVOM. The CCD pixel coordinates of the reference stars will be used to refine the astronomical position of the satellite, which will facilitate trigger rapid ground-based follow-up obsevations of the GRBs. In this algorithm, the image is divided into a number of grid cells and the ""global"" pixel-value maximum within each cell is taken as the first-guess position of a ""bright"" star. The correct center postion of a star is then computed using a simple iterative method. Applying two additional strategies, i.e., scanning the image only by even (or odd) lines or in a black-white chess board mode, are proposed to further reduce the time to extract the stars. To examine the efficiency of the above aglorithms, we applied them to the experimental images obtained with a ground-based telescope. We find that the accuracy of the astronomical positioning achieved by our method is comparable to that derived by using the conventional star-extraction method, while the former needs CPU time about 25 times less than the latter. This will significantly improve the performance of the SVOM VT mission."			arxiv	['Y. Qiu', 'H. Cai', 'J. Deng']	375.0
823	An architecture for the evaluation of intelligent systems	Javier Insa-Cabrera	2011-02-03 15:58:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0714v1	One of the main research areas in Artificial Intelligence is the coding of agents (programs) which are able to learn by themselves in any situation. This means that agents must be useful for purposes other than those they were created for, as, for example, playing chess. In this way we try to get closer to the pristine goal of Artificial Intelligence. One of the problems to decide whether an agent is really intelligent or not is the measurement of its intelligence, since there is currently no way to measure it in a reliable way. The purpose of this project is to create an interpreter that allows for the execution of several environments, including those which are generated randomly, so that an agent (a person or a program) can interact with them. Once the interaction between the agent and the environment is over, the interpreter will measure the intelligence of the agent according to the actions, states and rewards the agent has undergone inside the environment during the test. As a result we will be able to measure agents' intelligence in any possible environment, and to make comparisons between several agents, in order to determine which of them is the most intelligent. In order to perform the tests, the interpreter must be able to randomly generate environments that are really useful to measure agents' intelligence, since not any randomly generated environment will serve that purpose.			arxiv	['Jose Hernandez-Orallo']	376.0

Gandolfo	2011-07-25 10:22:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4884v1	"In this paper we consider a nearest-neighbor $p$-adic hard core (HC) model, with fugacity $\lambda$, on a homogeneous Cayley tree of order $k$ (with $k + 1$ neighbors). We focus on $p$-adic Gibbs measures for the HC model, in particular on $p$-adic ""splitting"" Gibbs measures generating a $p$-adic Markov chain along each path on the tree. We show that the $p$-adic HC model is completely different from real HC model: For a fixed $k$ we prove that the $p$-adic HC model may have a splitting Gibbs measure only if $p$ divides $2^k-1$. Moreover if $p$ divides $2^k-1$ but does not divide $k+2$ then there exists unique translational invariant $p$-adic Gibbs measure. We also study $p$-adic periodic splitting Gibbs measures and show that the above model admits only translational invariant and periodic with period two (chess-board) Gibbs measures. For $p\geq 7$ (resp. $p=2,3,5$) we give necessary and sufficient (resp. necessary) conditions for the existence of a periodic $p$-adic measure. For k=2 a $p$-adic splitting Gibbs measures exists if and only if p=3, in this case we show that if $\lambda$ belongs to a $p$-adic ball of radius 1/27 then there are precisely two periodic (non translational invariant) $p$-adic Gibbs measures.

However, these methods are not appropriate if we want to evaluate the general intelligence of AI and, even less, if we compare it with human intelligence. The ANYNT project has designed a new method of evaluation that tries to assess AI systems using well known computational notions and problems which are as general as possible. This new method serves to assess general intelligence (which allows us to learn how to solve any new kind of problem we face) and not only to evaluate performance on a set of specific tasks. This method not only focuses on measuring the intelligence of algorithms, but also to assess any intelligent system (human beings, animals, AI, aliens?,...), and letting us to place their results on the same scale and, therefore, to be able to compare them. This new approach will allow us (in the future) to evaluate and compare any kind of intelligent system known or even to build/find, be it artificial or biological. This master thesis aims at ensuring that this new method provides consistent results when evaluating AI algorithms, this is done through the design and implementation of prototypes of universal intelligence tests and their application to different intelligent systems (AI algorithms and humans beings). From the study we analyze whether the results obtained by two different intelligent systems are properly located on the same scale and we propose changes and refinements to these prototypes in order to, in the future, being able to achieve a truly universal intelligence test.			arxiv	['Jose Hernandez-Orallo']	378.0

It started with deploying animals to automate tasks in the field of agriculture(bulls), transportation (e.g. horses and donkeys), and even communication (pigeons). Millenniums after, come the Golden age with ""Al-jazari"" and other Muslim inventors, which were the pioneers of automation, this has given birth to industrial revolution in Europe, centuries after. At the end of the nineteenth century, a new era was to begin, the computational era, the most advanced technological and scientific development that is driving the mankind and the reason behind all the evolutions of science; such as medicine, communication, education, and physics. At this edge of technology engineers and scientists are trying to model a machine that behaves the same as they do, which pushed us to think about designing and implementing ""Things that-Thinks"", then artificial intelligence was. In this work we will cover each of the major discoveries and studies in the field of machine cognition, which are the ""Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer""(EPAM) and ""The General Problem Solver""(GPS). The First one focus mainly on implementing the human-verbal learning behavior, while the second one tries to model an architecture that is able to solve problems generally (e.g. theorem proving, chess playing, and arithmetic). We will cover the major goals and the main ideas of each model, as well as comparing their strengths and weaknesses, and finally giving their fields of applications. And Finally, we will suggest a real life implementation of a cognitive machine."			arxiv	[]	379.0
827	Modelling the Pb release during Portland cement alteration	A. Benard	2014-02-12 20:24:37	http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2962v1	Complex cementitious matrices undergo weathering with environmental exchange and can release metallic pollutants during alteration. The molecular mechanisms responsible for metal release are difficult to identify, though this is necessary if such processes are to be controlled. The present study determines and models the molecular mechanisms of Pb release during Portland cement leaching. As Pb release is strongly related to its speciation (i.e. atomic environment and the nature of bearing phases), the first objective of the present study was to investigate the evolution of Pb retention sites together with the evolution of the cement mineralogy during leaching. Complementary and efficient investigation tools were used, namely X-ray diffraction, micro-X-ray fluorescence and X-ray absorption fine structures. The second objective was to reproduce our results with a reactive transport code (CHESS/HYTEC) in order to test the proposed speciation model of Pb. Combined results indicate that in both the unaltered core and the altered layer of the leached cement, Pb(II) would be retained through C-S-H 'nano-structure', probably linked to a Q1 or Q2P silicate tetrahedra. Moreover in the altered layer, the presence of Fe atoms in the atomic environment of Pb is highly probable. Unfortunately little is known about Fe phases in cement, which makes the interpretation difficult. Can Fe- substituted hydrogranet (C3AH6) be responsible for Pb retention? Modelling results were consistent with Pb retention through C-S-H in layers and also in an additional, possibly Fe-containing, Pb-retention phase in the altered layer.			arxiv	['J.

828	A $q$-Queens Problem. II. The Square Board	Seth Chaiken	2014-02-20 03:42:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4880v3	We apply to the $n\times n$ chessboard the counting theory from Part I for nonattacking placements of chess pieces with unbounded straight-line moves, such as the queen. Part I showed that the number of ways to place $q$ identical nonattacking pieces is given by a quasipolynomial function of $n$ of degree $2q$, whose coefficients are (essentially) polynomials in $q$ that depend cyclically on $n$. Here we study the periods of the quasipolynomial and its coefficients, which are bounded by functions, not well understood, of the piece's move directions, and we develop exact formulas for the very highest coefficients. The coefficients of the three highest powers of $n$ do not vary with $n$. On the other hand, we present simple pieces for which the fourth coefficient varies periodically. We develop detailed properties of counting quasipolynomials that will be applied in sequels to partial queens, whose moves are subsets of those of the queen, and the nightrider, whose moves are extended knight's moves. We conclude with the first, though strange, formula for the classical $n$-Queens Problem and with several conjectures and open problems.			arxiv	['Christopher R. H. Hanusa', 'Thomas Zaslavsky']	381.0
829	A $q$-Queens Problem. III. Nonattacking Partial Queens	Seth Chaiken	2014-02-20 04:15:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4886v4	We apply our geometrical theory for counting placements of $q$ nonattacking on an $n\times n$ chessboard, from Parts~I and II, to partial queens: that is, chess pieces with any combination of horizontal, vertical, and $45^\circ$-diagonal moves. Parts~I and II showed that for any rider (a piece with moves of unlimited length) the answer will be a quasipolynomial function of $n$ in which the coefficients are essentially polynomials in $q$. Those general results gave the three highest-order coefficients of the counting quasipolynomial and formulas for counting placements of two nonattacking pieces and the combinatorially distinct types of such placements. By contrast, the unified framework we present here for partial queens allows us to explicitly compute the four highest-order coefficients of the counting quasipolynomial, show that the five highest-order coefficients are constant (independent of $n$), and find the period of the next coefficient (which depends upon the exact set of moves). Furthermore, for three nonattacking partial queens we are able to prove formulas for the total number of nonattacking placements and for the number of their combinatorially distinct types. The method of proof, as in the previous parts, is by detailed analysis of the lattice of subspaces of an inside-out polytope.			arxiv	['Christopher R. H. Hanusa', 'Thomas Zaslavsky']	382.0
830	SSS* = Alpha-Beta + TT	Aske Plaat	2014-04-05 20:09:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1517v1	In 1979 Stockman introduced the SSS* minimax search algorithm that domi- nates Alpha-Beta in the number of leaf nodes expanded. Further investigation of the algorithm showed that it had three serious drawbacks, which prevented its use by practitioners: it is difficult to understand, it has large memory requirements, and it is slow. This paper presents an alternate formulation of SSS*, in which it is implemented as a series of Alpha-Beta calls that use a transposition table (AB- SSS*). The reformulation solves all three perceived drawbacks of SSS*, making it a practical algorithm. Further, because the search is now based on Alpha-Beta, the extensive research on minimax search enhancements can be easily integrated into AB-SSS*. To test AB-SSS* in practise, it has been implemented in three state-of-the- art programs: for checkers, Othello and chess. AB-SSS* is comparable in performance to Alpha-Beta on leaf node count in all three games, making it a viable alternative to Alpha-Beta in practise. Whereas SSS* has usually been regarded as being entirely different from Alpha-Beta, it turns out to be just an Alpha-Beta enhancement, like null-window searching. This runs counter to published simulation results. Our research leads to the surprising result that iterative deepening versions of Alpha-Beta can expand fewer leaf nodes than iterative deepening versions of SSS* due to dynamic move re-ordering.			arxiv	['Jonathan Schaeffer', 'Wim Pijls', 'Arie de Bruin']	383.0
831	Nearly Optimal Minimax Tree Search?	Aske Plaat	2014-04-05 20:13:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1518v1	Knuth and Moore presented a theoretical lower bound on the number of leaves that any fixed-depth minimax tree-search algorithm traversing a uniform tree must explore, the so-called minimal tree. Since real-life minimax trees are not uniform, the exact size of this tree is not known for most applications. Further, most games have transpositions, implying that there exists a minimal graph which is smaller than the minimal tree. For three games (chess, Othello and checkers) we compute the size of the minimal tree and the minimal graph. Empirical evidence shows that in all three games, enhanced Alpha-Beta search is capable of building a tree that is close in size to that of the minimal graph. Hence, it appears game-playing programs build nearly optimal search trees. However, the conventional definition of the minimal graph is wrong. There are ways in which the size of the minimal graph can be reduced: by maximizing the number of transpositions in the search, and generating cutoffs using branches that lead to smaller search trees. The conventional definition of the minimal graph is just a left-most approximation. Calculating the size of the real minimal graph is too computationally intensive. However, upper bound approximations show it to be significantly smaller than the left-most minimal graph. Hence, it appears that game-playing programs are not searching as efficiently as is widely believed. Understanding the left-most and real minimal search graphs leads to some new ideas for enhancing Alpha-Beta search. One of them, enhanced transposition cutoffs, is shown to significantly reduce search tree size.			arxiv	['Jonathan Schaeffer', 'Wim Pijls', 'Arie de Bruin']	384.0
832	Completely effective error bounds for Stirling Numbers of the first and second kind via Poisson Approximation	Richard Arratia	2014-04-11 05:51:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3007v4	We provide completely effective error estimates for Stirling numbers of the first and second kind, denoted by $s(n,m)$ and $S(n,m)$, respectively. These bounds are useful for values of $m \geq n - O(\sqrt{n})$. An application of our Theorem 5 yields, for example, \[ s(10^{12},\ 10^{12}-2\times 10^6)/10^{35664464} \in [ 1.87669, 1.876982 ], \] \[ S(10^{12},\ 10^{12}-2\times 10^6)/10^{35664463} \in [ 1.30121, 1.306975 ]. \] The bounds are obtained via Chen-Stein Poisson approximation, using an interpretation of Stirling numbers as the number of ways of placing non-attacking rooks on a chess board. As a corollary to Theorem 5, summarized in Proposition 1, we obtain two simple and explicit asymptotic formulas, one for each of $s(n,m)$ and $S(n,m)$, for the parametrization $m = n - t\, n^a$, $0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{2}.$ These asymptotic formulas agree with the ones originally observed by Moser and Wyman in the range $0<a<\frac{1}{2}$, and they connect with a recent asymptotic expansion by Louchard for $\frac{1}{2}<a < 1$, hence filling the gap at $a = \frac{1}{2}$. We also provide a generalization applicable to rook and file numbers.			arxiv	['Stephen DeSalvo']	385.0
833	Forgetting and consolidation for incremental and cumulative knowledge acquisition systems	Fernando Mart√≠nez-Plumed	2015-02-19 16:25:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05615v1	The application of cognitive mechanisms to support knowledge acquisition is, from our point of view, crucial for making the resulting models coherent, efficient, credible, easy to use and understandable. In particular, there are two characteristic features of intelligence that are essential for knowledge development: forgetting and consolidation. Both plays an important role in knowledge bases and learning systems to avoid possible information overflow and redundancy, and in order to preserve and strengthen important or frequently used rules and remove (or forget) useless ones. We present an incremental, long-life view of knowledge acquisition which tries to improve task after task by determining what to keep, what to consolidate and what to forget, overcoming The Stability-Plasticity dilemma. In order to do that, we rate rules by introducing several metrics through the first adaptation, to our knowledge, of the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle to a coverage graph, a hierarchical assessment structure which treats evidence and rules in a unified way. The metrics are not only used to forget some of the worst rules, but also to set a consolidation process to promote those selected rules to the knowledge base, which is also mirrored by a demotion system. We evaluate the framework with a series of tasks in a chess rule learning domain.			arxiv	['C√®sar Ferri', 'Jos√© Hern√°ndez-Orallo', 'Mar√≠a Jos√© Ram√≠rez-Quintana']	386.0
834	Is Poker a Skill Game? New Insights from Statistical Physics	Marco Alberto Javarone	2015-03-30 14:27:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08683v2	During last years poker has gained a lot of prestige in several countries and, beyond to be one of the most famous card games, it represents a modern challenge for scientists belonging to different communities, spanning from artificial intelligence to physics and from psychology to mathematics. Unlike games like chess, the task of classifying the nature of poker (i.e., as 'skill game' or gambling) seems really hard and it also constitutes a current problem, whose solution has several implications. In general, gambling offers equal winning probabilities both to rational players (i.e., those that use a strategy) and to irrational ones (i.e., those without a strategy). Therefore, in order to uncover the nature of poker, a viable way is comparing performances of rational versus irrational players during a series of challenges. Recently, a work on this topic revealed that rationality is a fundamental ingredient to succeed in poker tournaments. In this study we analyze a simple model of poker challenges by a statistical physics approach, with the aim to uncover the nature of this game. As main result we found that, under particular conditions, few irrational players can turn poker into gambling. Therefore, although rationality is a key ingredient to succeed in poker, also the format of challenges has an important role in these dynamics, as it can strongly influence the underlying nature of the game. The importance of our results lies on related implications, as for instance in identifying the limits poker can be considered as a `skill game' and, as a consequence, which kind of format must be chosen to devise algorithms able to face humans.			arxiv	[]	387.0
835	HackAttack: Game-Theoretic Analysis of Realistic Cyber Conflicts	Erik M. Ferragut	2015-11-13 18:18:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04389v1	Game theory is appropriate for studying cyber conflict because it allows for an intelligent and goal-driven adversary. Applications of game theory have led to a number of results regarding optimal attack and defense strategies. However, the overwhelming majority of applications explore overly simplistic games, often ones in which each participant's actions are visible to every other participant. These simplifications strip away the fundamental properties of real cyber conflicts: probabilistic alerting, hidden actions, unknown opponent capabilities. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to analyze a more realistic game, one in which different resources have different weaknesses, players have different exploits, and moves occur in secrecy, but they can be detected. Certainly, more advanced and complex games are possible, but the game presented here is more realistic than any other game we know of in the scientific literature. While optimal strategies can be found for simpler games using calculus, case-by-case analysis, or, for stochastic games, Q-learning, our more complex game is more naturally analyzed using the same methods used to study other complex games, such as checkers and chess. We define a simple evaluation function and ploy multi-step searches to create strategies. We show that such scenarios can be analyzed, and find that in cases of extreme uncertainty, it is often better to ignore one's opponent's possible moves. Furthermore, we show that a simple evaluation function in a complex game can lead to interesting and nuanced strategies.			arxiv	['Andrew C. Brady', 'Ethan J. Brady', 'Jacob M. Ferragut', 'Nathan M.

It has become clear that a Large Ultraviolet/Optical/IR (LUVOIR) Surveyor mission (primary diameter 12 m, 1000 Ang - 2 micron spectroscopic bandpass) can carry out the largest number of NASA's exoplanet and astrophysics science goals over the coming decades. There are technical challenges for several aspects of the LUVOIR Surveyor concept, including component level technology readiness maturation and science instrument concepts for a broadly capable ultraviolet spectrograph. We present the scientific motivation for, and a preliminary design of, a multiplexed ultraviolet spectrograph to support both the exoplanet and astrophysics goals of the LUVOIR Surveyor mission concept, the Combined High-resolution and Imaging Spectrograph for the LUVOIR Surveyor (CHISL). CHISL includes a high-resolution (R 120,000; 1000 - 1700 Ang) point-source spectroscopy channel and a medium resolution (R > 14,000 from 1000 - 2000 Ang in a single observation and R 24,000 - 35,000 in multiple grating settings) imaging spectroscopy channel. We present the CHISL concept, a small sample of representative science cases, and the primary technological hurdles. We are actively engaged in laboratory and flight characterization efforts for CHISL-enabling technologies as components on sounding rocket payloads under development at the University of Colorado. We describe two payloads that are designed to be pathfinder instruments for the high-resolution (CHESS) and imaging spectroscopy (SISTINE) arms of CHISL. We are carrying out this instrument design, characterization, and flight-testing today to support the new start of a LUVOIR Surveyor mission in the next decade.			arxiv	['Brian Fleming', 'Keri Hoadley']	389.0
837	Tailoring magnetic energies to form dipole skyrmions and skyrmion lattices	S. A. Montoya	2016-08-03 21:42:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01368v2	The interesting physics and potential memory technologies resulting from topologically protected spin textures such as skyrmions, has prompted efforts to discover new material systems that can host these kind of magnetic structures. Here we use the highly tunable magnetic properties of amorphous Fe/Gd multilayer films to explore the magnetic properties that lead to dipole-stabilized skyrmions and skyrmion lattices that form from the competition of dipolar field and exchange energy. Using both real space imaging and reciprocal space scattering techniques we determined the range of material properties and magnetic fields where skyrmions form. Micromagnetic modeling closely matches our observation of small skyrmion features (~50 to 70nm) and suggests these class of skyrmions have a rich domain structure that is Bloch like in the center of the film and more N\'eel like towards each surface. Our results provide a pathway to engineer the formation and controllability of dipole skyrmion phases in a thin film geometry at different temperatures and magnetic fields.			arxiv	['S. Couture', 'J.

Some of Our Favorite Pieces: Queens, Bishops, Rooks, and Nightriders	Seth Chaiken	2016-09-03 19:07:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00853v5	Parts I-IV showed that the number of ways to place $q$ nonattacking queens or similar chess pieces on an $n\times n$ chessboard is a quasipolynomial function of $n$ whose coefficients are essentially polynomials in $q$. For partial queens, which have a subset of the queen's moves, we proved complete formulas for these counting quasipolynomials for small numbers of pieces and other formulas for high-order coefficients of the general counting quasipolynomials. We found some upper and lower bounds for the periods of those quasipolynomials by calculating explicit denominators of vertices of the inside-out polytope. Here we discover more about the counting quasipolynomials for partial queens, both familiar and strange, and the nightrider and its subpieces, and we compare our results to the empirical formulas found by Kot\v{e}\v{s}ovec. We prove some of Kot\v{e}\v{s}ovec's formulas and conjectures about the quasipolynomials and their high-order coefficients, and in some instances go beyond them.			arxiv	['Christopher R. H.

839	Online Categorical Subspace Learning for Sketching Big Data with Misses	Yanning Shen	2016-09-27 01:15:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08235v1	With the scale of data growing every day, reducing the dimensionality (a.k.a. sketching) of high-dimensional data has emerged as a task of paramount importance. Relevant issues to address in this context include the sheer volume of data that may consist of categorical samples, the typically streaming format of acquisition, and the possibly missing entries. To cope with these challenges, the present paper develops a novel categorical subspace learning approach to unravel the latent structure for three prominent categorical (bilinear) models, namely, Probit, Tobit, and Logit. The deterministic Probit and Tobit models treat data as quantized values of an analog-valued process lying in a low-dimensional subspace, while the probabilistic Logit model relies on low dimensionality of the data log-likelihood ratios. Leveraging the low intrinsic dimensionality of the sought models, a rank regularized maximum-likelihood estimator is devised, which is then solved recursively via alternating majorization-minimization to sketch high-dimensional categorical data `on the fly.' The resultant procedure alternates between sketching the new incomplete datum and refining the latent subspace, leading to lightweight first-order algorithms with highly parallelizable tasks per iteration. As an extra degree of freedom, the quantization thresholds are also learned jointly along with the subspace to enhance the predictive power of the sought models. Performance of the subspace iterates is analyzed for both infinite and finite data streams, where for the former asymptotic convergence to the stationary point set of the batch estimator is established, while for the latter sublinear regret bounds are derived for the empirical cost. Simulated tests with both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the merits of the novel schemes for real-time movie recommendation and chess-game classification.			arxiv	['Morteza Mardani', 'Georgios B.

Montoya	2017-02-15 17:36:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04691v2	The dynamic response of dipole skyrmions in Fe/Gd multilayer films is investigated by ferromagnetic resonance measurements and compared to micromagnetic simulations. We detail thickness and temperature dependent studies of the observed modes as well as the effects of magnetic field history on the resonant spectra. Correlation between the modes and the magnetic phase maps constructed from real-space imaging and scattering patterns allows us to conclude the resonant modes arise from local topological features such as dipole skyrmions but does not depend on the collective response of a closed packed lattice of these chiral textures. Using, micromagnetic modeling, we are able to quantitatively reproduce our experimental observations which suggests the existence of localized spin-wave modes that are dependent on the helicity of the dipole skyrmion. We identify four localized spin wave excitations for the skyrmions that are excited under either in-plane or out-of-plane r.f. fields. Lastly we show that dipole skyrmions and non-chiral bubble domains exhibit qualitatively different localized spin wave modes.			arxiv	['S. Couture', 'J. J. Chess', 'J. C. T Lee', 'N. Kent', 'M. -Y.

843	The Computational Complexity of Angry Birds	Matthew Stephenson	2018-12-19 07:39:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07793v3	The physics-based simulation game Angry Birds has been heavily researched by the AI community over the past five years, and has been the subject of a popular AI competition that is currently held annually as part of a leading AI conference. Developing intelligent agents that can play this game effectively has been an incredibly complex and challenging problem for traditional AI techniques to solve, even though the game is simple enough that any human player could learn and master it within a short time. In this paper we analyse how hard the problem really is, presenting several proofs for the computational complexity of Angry Birds. By using a combination of several gadgets within this game's environment, we are able to demonstrate that the decision problem of solving general levels for different versions of Angry Birds is either NP-hard, PSPACE-hard, PSPACE-complete or EXPTIME-hard. Proof of NP-hardness is by reduction from 3-SAT, whilst proof of PSPACE-hardness is by reduction from True Quantified Boolean Formula (TQBF). Proof of EXPTIME-hardness is by reduction from G2, a known EXPTIME-complete problem similar to that used for many previous games such as Chess, Go and Checkers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a single-player game has been proven EXPTIME-hard. This is achieved by using stochastic game engine dynamics to effectively model the real world, or in our case the physics simulator, as the opponent against which we are playing. These proofs can also be extended to other physics-based games with similar mechanics.			arxiv	['Jochen Renz', 'Xiaoyu Ge']	396.0
844	Highly sensitive piezotronic pressure sensors based on undoped GaAs nanowire ensembles	Yonatan Calahorra	2019-01-31 09:45:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11288v1	Semiconducting piezoelectric materials have attracted considerable interest due to their central role in the emerging field of piezotronics, where the development of a piezo-potential in response to stress or strain can be used to tune the band structure of the semiconductor, and hence its electronic properties. This coupling between piezoelectricity and semiconducting properties can be readily exploited for force or pressure sensing using nanowires, where the geometry and unclamped nature of nanowires render them particularly sensitive to small forces. At the same time, piezoelectricity is known to manifest more strongly in nanowires of certain semiconductors. Here, we report the design and fabrication of highly sensitive piezotronic pressure sensors based on GaAs nanowire ensemble sandwiched between two electrodes in a back-to-back diode configuration. We analyse the current-voltage characteristics of these nanowire-based devices in response to mechanical loading in light of the corresponding changes to the device band structure. We observe a high piezotronic sensitivity to pressure, of ~7800 meV/MPa. We attribute this high sensitivity to the nanowires being fully depleted due to the lack of doping, as well as due to geometrical pressure focusing and current funneling through polar interfaces.			arxiv	['Anke Husmann', 'Alice Bourdelain', 'Wonjong Kim', 'Jelena Vukajlovic-Plestina', 'Chess Boughey', 'Qingshen Jing', 'Anna Fontcuberta i Morral', 'Sohini Kar-Narayan']	397.0
845	Chiral asymmetry detected in a 2D array of permalloy square nanomagnets using circularly polarized X ray Resonant Magnetic Scattering	J. D√≠az	2019-07-03 16:24:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02016v2	The sensitivity of Circularly polarized X ray Resonant Magnetic Scattering (CXRMS) to chiral asymmetry has been demonstrated. The study was performed on a 2D array of Permalloy (Py) square nanomagnets of 700 nm lateral size arranged in a chess lattice of 1000 nm lattice parameter. Previous X ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism Photoemission Electron microscopy (XMCD-PEEM) images on this sample showed the formation of vortices at remanence and a preference in their chiral state. The magnetic hysteresis loops of the array along the diagonal axis of the squares indicate a non-negligible and anisotropic interaction between vortices. The intensity of the magnetic scattering using circularly polarized light along one of the diagonal axes of the square magnets becomes asymmetric in intensity in the direction transversal to the incident plane at fields where the vortex states are formed. The asymmetry sign is inverted when the direction of the applied magnetic field is inverted. The result is the expected in the presence of an unbalanced chiral distribution. The effect is observed by CXRMS due to the interference between the charge scattering and the magnetic scattering.			arxiv	['P. Gargiani', 'C. Quir√≥s', 'C. Redondo', 'R. Morales', 'L.

846	Quick X-ray Reflectivity using Monochromatic Synchrotron Radiation for Time-Resolved Applications	H. Joress	2017-11-08 22:08:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03183v2	We describe and demonstrate a new technique for parallel collection of x-ray reflectivity data, compatible with monochromatic synchrotron radiation and flat substrates, and apply it to the in-situ observation of thin-film growth. The method employs a polycapillary x-ray optic to produce a converging fan of radiation incident onto a sample surface, and an area detector to simultaneously collect the XRR signal over an angular range matching that of the incident fan. Factors determining the range and instrumental resolution of the technique in reciprocal space, in addition to the signal-to-background ratio, are described in detail. Our particular implementation records $\sim$5\degree{} in $2\theta$ and resolves Kiessig fringes from samples with layer thicknesses ranging from 3 to 76 nm. Finally, we illustrate the value of this approach by showing in-situ XRR data obtained with 100 ms time resolution during the growth of epitaxial \ce{La_{0.7}Sr_{0.3}MnO3} on \ce{SrTiO3} by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). Compared to prior methods for parallel XRR data collection, ours is the first method that is both sample-independent and compatible with highly collimated, monochromatic radiation typical of 3rd generation synchrotron sources. Further, our technique can be readily adapted for use with laboratory-based sources.			arxiv	['J. D. Brock', 'A. R. Woll']	399.0
847	The Hanabi Challenge: A New Frontier for AI Research	Nolan Bard	2019-02-01 18:59:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00506v2	From the early days of computing, games have been important testbeds for studying how well machines can do sophisticated decision making. In recent years, machine learning has made dramatic advances with artificial agents reaching superhuman performance in challenge domains like Go, Atari, and some variants of poker. As with their predecessors of chess, checkers, and backgammon, these game domains have driven research by providing sophisticated yet well-defined challenges for artificial intelligence practitioners. We continue this tradition by proposing the game of Hanabi as a new challenge domain with novel problems that arise from its combination of purely cooperative gameplay with two to five players and imperfect information. In particular, we argue that Hanabi elevates reasoning about the beliefs and intentions of other agents to the foreground. We believe developing novel techniques for such theory of mind reasoning will not only be crucial for success in Hanabi, but also in broader collaborative efforts, especially those with human partners. To facilitate future research, we introduce the open-source Hanabi Learning Environment, propose an experimental framework for the research community to evaluate algorithmic advances, and assess the performance of current state-of-the-art techniques.			arxiv	['Jakob N.

The decisions, made by humans or computers, describe a trajectory through a high-dimensional representation space of the problem. By means of dimensionality reduction, these trajectories can be visualized in lower-dimensional space. Such embedded trajectories have previously been applied to a wide variety of data, but analysis has focused almost exclusively on the self-similarity of single trajectories. In contrast, we describe patterns emerging from drawing many trajectories -- for different initial conditions, end states, and solution strategies -- in the same embedding space. We argue that general statements about the problem-solving tasks and solving strategies can be made by interpreting these patterns. We explore and characterize such patterns in trajectories resulting from human and machine-made decisions in a variety of application domains: logic puzzles (Rubik's cube), strategy games (chess), and optimization problems (neural network training). We also discuss the importance of suitably chosen representation spaces and similarity metrics for the embedding.			arxiv	['Christian Steinparz', 'Moritz Sch√∂fl', 'Holger Stitz', 'Marc Streit']	401.0
849	A $q$-Queens Problem. I. General Theory	Seth Chaiken	2013-03-08 03:45:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1879v2	By means of the Ehrhart theory of inside-out polytopes we establish a general counting theory for nonattacking placements of chess pieces with unbounded straight-line moves, such as the queen, on a polygonal convex board. The number of ways to place $q$ identical nonattacking pieces on a board of variable size $n$ but fixed shape is given by a quasipolynomial function of $n$, of degree $2q$, whose coefficients are polynomials in $q$. The number of combinatorially distinct types of nonattacking configuration is the evaluation of our quasipolynomial at $n=-1$. The quasipolynomial has an exact formula that depends on a matroid of weighted graphs, which is in turn determined by incidence properties of lines in the real affine plane. We study the highest-degree coefficients and also the period of the quasipolynomial, which is needed if the quasipolynomial is to be interpolated from data, and which is bounded by some function, not well understood, of the board and the piece's move directions. In subsequent parts we specialize to the square board and then to subsets of the queen's moves, and we prove exact formulas (most but not all already known empirically) for small numbers of queens, bishops, and nightriders. Each part concludes with open questions, both specialized and broad.			arxiv	['Christopher R. H. Hanusa', 'Thomas Zaslavsky']	402.0
850	The Complexity of Human Computation: A Concrete Model with an Application to Passwords	Manuel Blum	2017-07-05 03:25:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01204v1	"What can humans compute in their heads? We are thinking of a variety of Crypto Protocols, games like Sudoku, Crossword Puzzles, Speed Chess, and so on. The intent of this paper is to apply the ideas and methods of theoretical computer science to better understand what humans can compute in their heads. For example, can a person compute a function in their head so that an eavesdropper with a powerful computer --- who sees the responses to random input --- still cannot infer responses to new inputs? To address such questions, we propose a rigorous model of human computation and associated measures of complexity. We apply the model and measures first and foremost to the problem of (1) humanly computable password generation, and then consider related problems of (2) humanly computable ""one-way functions"" and (3) humanly computable ""pseudorandom generators"". The theory of Human Computability developed here plays by different rules than standard computability, and this takes some getting used to. For reasons to be made clear, the polynomial versus exponential time divide of modern computability theory is irrelevant to human computation. In human computability, the step-counts for both humans and computers must be more concrete. Specifically, we restrict the adversary to at most 10^24 (Avogadro number of) steps. An alternate view of this work is that it deals with the analysis of algorithms and counting steps for the case that inputs are small as opposed to the usual case of inputs large-in-the-limit."			arxiv	['Santosh Vempala']	403.0
851	Photonic Nambu-Goldstone bosons	Miguel √Ångel Garc√≠a-March	2017-07-07 15:03:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02213v3	We study numerically the spatial dynamics of light in periodic square lattices in the presence of a Kerr term, emphasizing the peculiarities stemming from the nonlinearity. We find that, under rather general circumstances, the phase pattern of the stable ground state depends on the character of the nonlinearity: the phase is spatially uniform if it is defocusing whereas in the focusing case, it presents a chess board pattern, with a difference of $\pi$ between neighboring sites. We show that the lowest lying perturbative excitations can be described as perturbations of the phase and that finite-sized structures can act as tunable metawaveguides for them. The tuning is made by varying the intensity of the light that, because of the nonlinearity, affects the dynamics of the phase fluctuations. We interpret the results using methods of condensed matter physics, based on an effective description of the optical system. This interpretation sheds new light on the phenomena, facilitating the understanding of individual systems and leading to a framework for relating different problems with the same symmetry. In this context, we show that the perturbative excitations of the phase are Nambu-Goldstone bosons of a spontaneously broken $U(1)$ symmetry.			arxiv	['√Ångel Paredes', 'Mario Zacar√©s', 'Humberto Michinel', 'Albert Ferrando']	404.0
852	Between Progress and Potential Impact of AI: the Neglected Dimensions	Fernando Mart√≠nez-Plumed	2018-06-02 09:21:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00610v2	We reframe the analysis of progress in AI by incorporating into an overall framework both the task performance of a system, and the time and resource costs incurred in the development and deployment of the system. These costs include: data, expert knowledge, human oversight, software resources, computing cycles, hardware and network facilities, and (what kind of) time. These costs are distributed over the life cycle of the system, and may place differing demands on different developers and users. The multidimensional performance and cost space we present can be collapsed to a single utility metric that measures the value of the system for different stakeholders. Even without a single utility function, AI advances can be generically assessed by whether they expand the Pareto surface. We label these types of costs as neglected dimensions of AI progress, and explore them using four case studies: Alpha* (Go, Chess, and other board games), ALE (Atari games), ImageNet (Image classification) and Virtual Personal Assistants (Siri, Alexa, Cortana, and Google Assistant). This broader model of progress in AI will lead to novel ways of estimating the potential societal use and impact of an AI system, and the establishment of milestones for future progress.			arxiv	['Shahar Avin', 'Miles Brundage', 'Allan Dafoe', 'Sean √ì h√âigeartaigh', 'Jos√© Hern√°ndez-Orallo']	405.0
853	Comparative study of performance of parallel Alpha Beta Pruning for different architectures	Shubhendra Pal Singhal	2019-08-30 11:36:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11660v2	Optimization of searching the best possible action depending on various states like state of environment, system goal etc. has been a major area of study in computer systems. In any search algorithm, searching best possible solution from the pool of every possibility known can lead to the construction of the whole state search space popularly called as minimax algorithm. This may lead to a impractical time complexities which may not be suitable for real time searching operations. One of the practical solution for the reduction in computational time is Alpha Beta pruning. Instead of searching for the whole state space, we prune the unnecessary branches, which helps reduce the time by significant amount. This paper focuses on the various possible implementations of the Alpha Beta pruning algorithms and gives an insight of what algorithm can be used for parallelism. Various studies have been conducted on how to make Alpha Beta pruning faster. Parallelizing Alpha Beta pruning for the GPUs specific architectures like mesh(CUDA) etc. or shared memory model(OpenMP) helps in the reduction of the computational time. This paper studies the comparison between sequential and different parallel forms of Alpha Beta pruning and their respective efficiency for the chess game as an application.			arxiv	['M.

Even in 2016, the best AI system achieved merely 59.3% on an 8th Grade science exam challenge. This paper reports unprecedented success on the Grade 8 New York Regents Science Exam, where for the first time a system scores more than 90% on the exam's non-diagram, multiple choice (NDMC) questions. In addition, our Aristo system, building upon the success of recent language models, exceeded 83% on the corresponding Grade 12 Science Exam NDMC questions. The results, on unseen test questions, are robust across different test years and different variations of this kind of test. They demonstrate that modern NLP methods can result in mastery on this task. While not a full solution to general question-answering (the questions are multiple choice, and the domain is restricted to 8th Grade science), it represents a significant milestone for the field.			arxiv	['Oren Etzioni', 'Daniel Khashabi', 'Tushar Khot', 'Bhavana Dalvi Mishra', 'Kyle Richardson', 'Ashish Sabharwal', 'Carissa Schoenick', 'Oyvind Tafjord', 'Niket Tandon', 'Sumithra Bhakthavatsalam', 'Dirk Groeneveld', 'Michal Guerquin', 'Michael Schmitz']	407.0
855	Will recent advances in AI result in a paradigm shift in Astrobiology and SETI?	Joe Gale	2019-09-19 17:20:37	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03944v1	"The steady advances in computer performance and in programming raise the concern that the ability of computers would overtake that of the human brain, an occurrence termed ""the Singularity"". While comparing the size of the human brain and the advance in computer capacity, the Singularity has been estimated to occur within a few decades although the capacity of conventional computers may reach its limits in the near future. However, in the last few years, there have been rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI). There are already programs that carry out pattern recognition and self-learning which, at least in limited fields such as chess and other games, are superior to the best human players. Furthermore, the quantum computing revolution, which is expected to vastly increase computer capacities, is already on our doorstep. It now seems inevitable that the Singularity will arrive within the foreseeable future. Biological life, on Earth and on extraterrestrial planets and their satellites, may continue as before, but humanity could be 'replaced' by computers. Older and more advanced intelligent life forms, possibly evolved elsewhere in the universe, may have passed their Singularity a long time ago. Post Singularity life would probably be based not on biochemical reactions but on electronics. Their communication may use effects such as quantum entanglement and be undetectable to us. This may explain the Fermi paradox or at least the ""Big Silence"" problem in SETI."			arxiv	['Amri Wandel', 'Hugh Hill']	408.0
856	Learning to Resolve Alliance Dilemmas in Many-Player Zero-Sum Games	Edward Hughes	2020-02-27 10:32:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00799v1	"Zero-sum games have long guided artificial intelligence research, since they possess both a rich strategy space of best-responses and a clear evaluation metric. What's more, competition is a vital mechanism in many real-world multi-agent systems capable of generating intelligent innovations: Darwinian evolution, the market economy and the AlphaZero algorithm, to name a few. In two-player zero-sum games, the challenge is usually viewed as finding Nash equilibrium strategies, safeguarding against exploitation regardless of the opponent. While this captures the intricacies of chess or Go, it avoids the notion of cooperation with co-players, a hallmark of the major transitions leading from unicellular organisms to human civilization. Beyond two players, alliance formation often confers an advantage; however this requires trust, namely the promise of mutual cooperation in the face of incentives to defect. Successful play therefore requires adaptation to co-players rather than the pursuit of non-exploitability. Here we argue that a systematic study of many-player zero-sum games is a crucial element of artificial intelligence research. Using symmetric zero-sum matrix games, we demonstrate formally that alliance formation may be seen as a social dilemma, and empirically that na\""ive multi-agent reinforcement learning therefore fails to form alliances. We introduce a toy model of economic competition, and show how reinforcement learning may be augmented with a peer-to-peer contract mechanism to discover and enforce alliances. Finally, we generalize our agent model to incorporate temporally-extended contracts, presenting opportunities for further work."			arxiv	['Thomas W. Anthony', 'Tom Eccles', 'Joel Z.

In recent years, studies on game AI have gradually evolved from relatively simple environments (e.g., perfect-information games such as Go, chess, shogi or two-player imperfect-information games such as heads-up Texas hold'em) to more complex ones (e.g., multi-player imperfect-information games such as multi-player Texas hold'em and StartCraft II). Mahjong is a popular multi-player imperfect-information game worldwide but very challenging for AI research due to its complex playing/scoring rules and rich hidden information. We design an AI for Mahjong, named Suphx, based on deep reinforcement learning with some newly introduced techniques including global reward prediction, oracle guiding, and run-time policy adaptation. Suphx has demonstrated stronger performance than most top human players in terms of stable rank and is rated above 99.99% of all the officially ranked human players in the Tenhou platform. This is the first time that a computer program outperforms most top human players in Mahjong.			arxiv	['Sotetsu Koyamada', 'Qiwei Ye', 'Guoqing Liu', 'Chao Wang', 'Ruihan Yang', 'Li Zhao', 'Tao Qin', 'Tie-Yan Liu', 'Hsiao-Wuen Hon']	410.0

And while online search has been commonly used in perfect information games such as Chess and Go, online search methods for imperfect information games have only been introduced relatively recently. This paper addresses the question of what is a sound online algorithm in an imperfect information setting of two-player zero-sum games. We argue that the~fixed-strategy~definitions of exploitability and $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria are ill-suited to measure an online algorithm's worst-case performance. We thus formalize $\epsilon$-soundness, a concept that connects the worst-case performance of an online algorithm to the performance of an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium. As $\epsilon$-soundness can be difficult to compute in general, we introduce a consistency framework -- a hierarchy that connects an online algorithm's behavior to a Nash equilibrium. These multiple levels of consistency describe in what sense an online algorithm plays ""just like a fixed Nash equilibrium"". These notions further illustrate the difference between perfect and imperfect information settings, as the same consistency guarantees have different worst-case online performance in perfect and imperfect information games. The definitions of soundness and the consistency hierarchy finally provide appropriate tools to analyze online algorithms in repeated imperfect information games. We thus inspect some of the previous online algorithms in a new light, bringing new insights into their worst-case performance guarantees."			arxiv	['Martin Schmid', 'Matej Moravƒç√≠k', 'Neil Burch', 'Marc Lanctot', 'Michael Bowling']	411.0
859	Random access codes via quantum contextual redundancy	Giancarlo Gatti	2021-03-01 18:50:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01204v3	We propose a protocol to encode classical bits in the measurement statistics of many-body Pauli observables, leveraging quantum correlations for a random access code. Measurement contexts built with these observables yield outcomes with intrinsic redundancy, something we exploit by encoding the data into a set of convenient context eigenstates. This allows to randomly access the encoded data with few resources. The eigenstates used are highly entangled and can be generated by a discretely-parametrized quantum circuit of low depth. Applications of this protocol include algorithms requiring large-data storage with only partial retrieval, as is the case of decision trees. Using $n$-qubit states, this Quantum Random Access Code has greater success probability than its classical counterpart for $n\ge 14$ and than previous Quantum Random Access Codes for $n \ge 16$. Furthermore, for $n\ge 18$, it can be amplified into a nearly-lossless compression protocol with success probability $0.999$ and compression ratio $O(n^2/2^n)$. The data it can store is equal to Google-Drive server capacity for $n= 44$, and to a brute-force solution for chess (what to do on any board configuration) for $n= 100$.			arxiv	['Daniel Huerga', 'Enrique Solano', 'Mikel Sanz']	412.0
860	OLIVAW: Mastering Othello without Human Knowledge, nor a Fortune	Antonio Norelli	2021-03-31 17:21:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17228v4	We introduce OLIVAW, an AI Othello player adopting the design principles of the famous AlphaGo programs. The main motivation behind OLIVAW was to attain exceptional competence in a non-trivial board game at a tiny fraction of the cost of its illustrious predecessors. In this paper, we show how the AlphaGo Zero's paradigm can be successfully applied to the popular game of Othello using only commodity hardware and free cloud services. While being simpler than Chess or Go, Othello maintains a considerable search space and difficulty in evaluating board positions. To achieve this result, OLIVAW implements some improvements inspired by recent works to accelerate the standard AlphaGo Zero learning process. The main modification implies doubling the positions collected per game during the training phase, by including also positions not played but largely explored by the agent. We tested the strength of OLIVAW in three different ways: by pitting it against Edax, the strongest open-source Othello engine, by playing anonymous games on the web platform OthelloQuest, and finally in two in-person matches against top-notch human players: a national champion and a former world champion.			arxiv	['Alessandro Panconesi']	413.0
861	Hybrid Intelligence	Dominik Dellermann	2021-05-03 08:56:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00691v1	Research has a long history of discussing what is superior in predicting certain outcomes: statistical methods or the human brain. This debate has repeatedly been sparked off by the remarkable technological advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), such as solving tasks like object and speech recognition, achieving significant improvements in accuracy through deep-learning algorithms (Goodfellow et al. 2016), or combining various methods of computational intelligence, such as fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and case-based reasoning (Medsker 2012). One of the implicit promises that underlie these advancements is that machines will 1 day be capable of performing complex tasks or may even supersede humans in performing these tasks. This triggers new heated debates of when machines will ultimately replace humans (McAfee and Brynjolfsson 2017). While previous research has proved that AI performs well in some clearly defined tasks such as playing chess, playing Go or identifying objects on images, it is doubted that the development of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) which is able to solve multiple tasks at the same time can be achieved in the near future (e.g., Russell and Norvig 2016). Moreover, the use of AI to solve complex business problems in organizational contexts occurs scarcely, and applications for AI that solve complex problems remain mainly in laboratory settings instead of being implemented in practice. Since the road to AGI is still a long one, we argue that the most likely paradigm for the division of labor between humans and machines in the next decades is Hybrid Intelligence. This concept aims at using the complementary strengths of human intelligence and AI, so that they can perform better than each of the two could separately (e.g., Kamar 2016).			arxiv	['Philipp Ebel', 'Matthias Soellner', 'Jan Marco Leimeister']	414.0
862	Playing Codenames with Language Graphs and Word Embeddings	Divya Koyyalagunta	2021-05-12 18:23:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05885v1	Although board games and video games have been studied for decades in artificial intelligence research, challenging word games remain relatively unexplored. Word games are not as constrained as games like chess or poker. Instead, word game strategy is defined by the players' understanding of the way words relate to each other. The word game Codenames provides a unique opportunity to investigate common sense understanding of relationships between words, an important open challenge. We propose an algorithm that can generate Codenames clues from the language graph BabelNet or from any of several embedding methods - word2vec, GloVe, fastText or BERT. We introduce a new scoring function that measures the quality of clues, and we propose a weighting term called DETECT that incorporates dictionary-based word representations and document frequency to improve clue selection. We develop BabelNet-Word Selection Framework (BabelNet-WSF) to improve BabelNet clue quality and overcome the computational barriers that previously prevented leveraging language graphs for Codenames. Extensive experiments with human evaluators demonstrate that our proposed innovations yield state-of-the-art performance, with up to 102.8% improvement in precision@2 in some cases. Overall, this work advances the formal study of word games and approaches for common sense language understanding.			arxiv	['Anna Sun', 'Rachel Lea Draelos', 'Cynthia Rudin']	415.0

Sziklai	2021-05-25 13:39:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11939v2	This research investigates how to determine whether two rankings come from the same distribution. We evaluate three hybrid tests: Wilcoxon's, Dietterich's, and Alpaydin's statistical tests combined with cross-validation (CV), each operating with folds ranging from 5 to 10, thus altogether 18 variants. We have applied these tests in the framework of a popular comparative statistical test, the Sum of Ranking Differences that builds upon the Manhattan distance between the rankings. The introduced methodology is widely applicable from machine learning through social sciences. To compare these methods, we have followed an innovative approach borrowed from Economics. We designed nine scenarios for testing type I and II errors. These represent typical situations (that is, different data structures) that CV tests face routinely. The optimal CV method depends on the preferences regarding the minimization of type I/II errors, size of the input, and expected patterns in the data. The Wilcoxon method with eight folds proved to be the best for all three investigated input sizes. Although the Dietterich and Alpaydin methods are the best in type I situations, they fail badly in type II cases. We demonstrate our results on real-world data, borrowed from chess and chemistry. Overall we cannot recommend either Alpaydin or Dietterich as an alternative to Wilcoxon cross-validation.			arxiv	['M√°t√© Baranyi', 'K√°roly H√©berger']	416.0

Generalizing from Easy to Hard Problems with Recurrent Networks	Avi Schwarzschild	2021-06-08 17:19:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04537v2	"Deep neural networks are powerful machines for visual pattern recognition, but reasoning tasks that are easy for humans may still be difficult for neural models. Humans possess the ability to extrapolate reasoning strategies learned on simple problems to solve harder examples, often by thinking for longer. For example, a person who has learned to solve small mazes can easily extend the very same search techniques to solve much larger mazes by spending more time. In computers, this behavior is often achieved through the use of algorithms, which scale to arbitrarily hard problem instances at the cost of more computation. In contrast, the sequential computing budget of feed-forward neural networks is limited by their depth, and networks trained on simple problems have no way of extending their reasoning to accommodate harder problems. In this work, we show that recurrent networks trained to solve simple problems with few recurrent steps can indeed solve much more complex problems simply by performing additional recurrences during inference. We demonstrate this algorithmic behavior of recurrent networks on prefix sum computation, mazes, and chess. In all three domains, networks trained on simple problem instances are able to extend their reasoning abilities at test time simply by ""thinking for longer."""			arxiv	['Eitan Borgnia', 'Arjun Gupta', 'Furong Huang', 'Uzi Vishkin', 'Micah Goldblum', 'Tom Goldstein']	417.0
865	Subgame solving without common knowledge	Brian Hu Zhang	2021-06-10 22:09:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06068v2	In imperfect-information games, subgame solving is significantly more challenging than in perfect-information games, but in the last few years, such techniques have been developed. They were the key ingredient to the milestone of superhuman play in no-limit Texas hold'em poker. Current subgame-solving techniques analyze the entire common-knowledge closure of the player's current information set, that is, the smallest set of nodes within which it is common knowledge that the current node lies. While this is acceptable in games like poker where the common-knowledge closure is relatively small, many practical games have more complex information structure, which renders the common-knowledge closure impractically large to enumerate or even reasonably approximate. We introduce an approach that overcomes this obstacle, by instead working with only low-order knowledge. Our approach allows an agent, upon arriving at an infoset, to basically prune any node that is no longer reachable, thereby massively reducing the game tree size relative to the common-knowledge subgame. We prove that, as is, our approach can increase exploitability compared to the blueprint strategy. However, we develop three avenues by which safety can be guaranteed. Even without the safety-guaranteeing additions, experiments on medium-sized games show that our approach always reduced exploitability in practical games even when applied at every infoset, and a depth-limited version of it led to -- to our knowledge -- the first strong AI for the challenge problem dark chess.			arxiv	['Tuomas Sandholm']	418.0

This is crucial for activities such as teaching, offering assistance, and deciding between blame or forgiveness. However, Bayesian models of theory of mind have generally not accounted for these mistakes, instead modeling agents as mostly optimal in achieving their goals. As a result, they are unable to explain phenomena like locking oneself out of one's house, or losing a game of chess. Here, we extend the Bayesian Theory of Mind framework to model boundedly rational agents who may have mistaken goals, plans, and actions. We formalize this by modeling agents as probabilistic programs, where goals may be confused with semantically similar states, plans may be misguided due to resource-bounded planning, and actions may be unintended due to execution errors. We present experiments eliciting human goal inferences in two domains: (i) a gridworld puzzle with gems locked behind doors, and (ii) a block-stacking domain. Our model better explains human inferences than alternatives, while generalizing across domains. These findings indicate the importance of modeling others as bounded agents, in order to account for the full richness of human intuitive psychology.			arxiv	['Gloria Z.

867	SwarmPlay: A Swarm of Nano-Quadcopters Playing Tic-tac-toe Board Game against a Human	Ekaterina Karmanova	2021-08-01 16:43:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00488v1	We present a new paradigm of games, i.e. SwarmPlay, where each playing component is presented by an individual drone that has its own mobility and swarm intelligence to win against a human player. The motivation behind the research is to make the games with machines tangible and interactive. Although some research on the robotic players for board games already exists, e.g., chess, the SwarmPlay technology has the potential to offer much more engagement and interaction with a human as it proposes a multi-agent swarm instead of a single interactive robot. The proposed system consists of a robotic swarm, a workstation, a computer vision (CV), and Game Theory-based algorithms. A novel game algorithm was developed to provide a natural game experience to the user. The preliminary user study revealed that participants were highly engaged in the game with drones (69% put a maximum score on the Likert scale) and found it less artificial compared to the regular computer-based systems (77% put maximum score). The affection of the user's game perception from its outcome was analyzed and put under discussion. User study revealed that SwarmPlay has the potential to be implemented in a wider range of games, significantly improving human-drone interactivity.			arxiv	['Valerii Serpiva', 'Stepan Perminov', 'Roman Ibrahimov', 'Aleksey Fedoseev', 'Dzmitry Tsetserukou']	420.0
868	SwarmPlay: Interactive Tic-tac-toe Board Game with Swarm of Nano-UAVs driven by Reinforcement Learning	Ekaterina Karmanova	2021-08-03 16:01:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01593v1	Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been actively applied in the field of robotics, allowing the system itself to find a solution for a task otherwise requiring a complex decision-making algorithm. In this paper, we present a novel RL-based Tic-tac-toe scenario, i.e. SwarmPlay, where each playing component is presented by an individual drone that has its own mobility and swarm intelligence to win against a human player. Thus, the combination of challenging swarm strategy and human-drone collaboration aims to make the games with machines tangible and interactive. Although some research on AI for board games already exists, e.g., chess, the SwarmPlay technology has the potential to offer much more engagement and interaction with the user as it proposes a multi-agent swarm instead of a single interactive robot. We explore user's evaluation of RL-based swarm behavior in comparison with the game theory-based behavior. The preliminary user study revealed that participants were highly engaged in the game with drones (70% put a maximum score on the Likert scale) and found it less artificial compared to the regular computer-based systems (80%). The affection of the user's game perception from its outcome was analyzed and put under discussion. User study revealed that SwarmPlay has the potential to be implemented in a wider range of games, significantly improving human-drone interactivity.			arxiv	['Valerii Serpiva', 'Stepan Perminov', 'Aleksey Fedoseev', 'Dzmitry Tsetserukou']	421.0
869	Design of a novel compact neutron collimator	Roberto Bedogni	2021-08-06 14:19:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03238v1	In this work the concept of a novel slow neutron collimator and the way to operate it are presented. The idea is based on the possibility to decouple the device field-of-view from its collimation power. A multi-channel geometry is proposed consisting of a chess-board structure where highly neutron-absorbing channels are alternated to air channels. A borated polymer was purposely developed to produce the attenuating components in the form of square-sectioned long rods. A scalable structure consisting of multiple collimation sectors can be arranged. The geometrical parameter LD, corresponding to the ratio between the length of a channel and its width, defines the collimation power. Several sectors can be arranged one after the other to reach relevant collimation powers. Each sector, 100 mm long, is composed by several channels with D = 2.5 mm corresponding to an L/D coefficient of 40. The target field of view is 50x50 mm2. This novel collimator, developed inside the INFN-ANET collaboration, due to its intrinsic compactness, will be of great importance to enhance the neutron imaging capability of small to medium-size neutron sources.			arxiv	['Marco Costa', 'Elisabetta Durisi', 'Francesco Grazzi', 'Alessandro Lega', 'Ettore Mafucci', 'Luca Menzio', 'Valeria Monti', 'Oriol Sans-Planell', 'Lorenzo Visca']	422.0
870	Method for making multi-attribute decisions in wargames by combining intuitionistic fuzzy numbers with reinforcement learning	Yuxiang Sun	2021-09-06 10:45:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02354v1	Researchers are increasingly focusing on intelligent games as a hot research area.The article proposes an algorithm that combines the multi-attribute management and reinforcement learning methods, and that combined their effect on wargaming, it solves the problem of the agent's low rate of winning against specific rules and its inability to quickly converge during intelligent wargame training.At the same time, this paper studied a multi-attribute decision making and reinforcement learning algorithm in a wargame simulation environment, and obtained data on red and blue conflict.Calculate the weight of each attribute based on the intuitionistic fuzzy number weight calculations. Then determine the threat posed by each opponent's chess pieces.Using the red side reinforcement learning reward function, the AC framework is trained on the reward function, and an algorithm combining multi-attribute decision-making with reinforcement learning is obtained. A simulation experiment confirms that the algorithm of multi-attribute decision-making combined with reinforcement learning presented in this paper is significantly more intelligent than the pure reinforcement learning algorithm.By resolving the shortcomings of the agent's neural network, coupled with sparse rewards in large-map combat games, this robust algorithm effectively reduces the difficulties of convergence. It is also the first time in this field that an algorithm design for intelligent wargaming combines multi-attribute decision making with reinforcement learning.Attempt interdisciplinary cross-innovation in the academic field, like designing intelligent wargames and improving reinforcement learning algorithms.			arxiv	['Bo Yuan', 'Yufan Xue', 'Jiawei Zhou', 'Xiaoyu Zhang', 'Xianzhong Zhou']	423.0
871	Talking Space: inference from spatial linguistic meanings	Vincent Wang-Mascianica	2021-09-14 09:53:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06554v2	This paper concerns the intersection of natural language and the physical space around us in which we live, that we observe and/or imagine things within. Many important features of language have spatial connotations, for example, many prepositions (like in, next to, after, on, etc.) are fundamentally spatial. Space is also a key factor of the meanings of many words/phrases/sentences/text, and space is a, if not the key, context for referencing (e.g. pointing) and embodiment. We propose a mechanism for how space and linguistic structure can be made to interact in a matching compositional fashion. Examples include Cartesian space, subway stations, chesspieces on a chess-board, and Penrose's staircase. The starting point for our construction is the DisCoCat model of compositional natural language meaning, which we relax to accommodate physical space. We address the issue of having multiple agents/objects in a space, including the case that each agent has different capabilities with respect to that space, e.g., the specific moves each chesspiece can make, or the different velocities one may be able to reach. Once our model is in place, we show how inferences drawing from the structure of physical space can be made. We also how how linguistic model of space can interact with other such models related to our senses and/or embodiment, such as the conceptual spaces of colour, taste and smell, resulting in a rich compositional model of meaning that is close to human experience and embodiment in the world.			arxiv	['Bob Coecke']	424.0
872	A Novel Automated Curriculum Strategy to Solve Hard Sokoban Planning Instances	Dieqiao Feng	2021-10-03 00:44:50	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00898v1	In recent years, we have witnessed tremendous progress in deep reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks such as Go, Chess, video games, and robot control. Nevertheless, other combinatorial domains, such as AI planning, still pose considerable challenges for RL approaches. The key difficulty in those domains is that a positive reward signal becomes {\em exponentially rare} as the minimal solution length increases. So, an RL approach loses its training signal. There has been promising recent progress by using a curriculum-driven learning approach that is designed to solve a single hard instance. We present a novel {\em automated} curriculum approach that dynamically selects from a pool of unlabeled training instances of varying task complexity guided by our {\em difficulty quantum momentum} strategy. We show how the smoothness of the task hardness impacts the final learning results. In particular, as the size of the instance pool increases, the ``hardness gap'' decreases, which facilitates a smoother automated curriculum based learning process. Our automated curriculum approach dramatically improves upon the previous approaches. We show our results on Sokoban, which is a traditional PSPACE-complete planning problem and presents a great challenge even for specialized solvers. Our RL agent can solve hard instances that are far out of reach for any previous state-of-the-art Sokoban solver. In particular, our approach can uncover plans that require hundreds of steps, while the best previous search methods would take many years of computing time to solve such instances. In addition, we show that we can further boost the RL performance with an intricate coupling of our automated curriculum approach with a curiosity-driven search strategy and a graph neural net representation.			arxiv	['Carla P.

873	An Enactivist account of Mind Reading in Natural Language Understanding	Peter Wallis	2021-11-11 12:46:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06179v5	"In this paper we apply our understanding of the radical enactivist agenda to the classic AI-hard problem of Natural Language Understanding. When Turing devised his famous test the assumption was that a computer could use language and the challenge would be to mimic human intelligence. It turned out playing chess and formal logic were easy compared to understanding what people say. The techniques of good old-fashioned AI (GOFAI) assume symbolic representation is the core of reasoning and by that paradigm human communication consists of transferring representations from one mind to another. However, one finds that representations appear in another's mind, without appearing in the intermediary language. People communicate by mind reading it seems. Systems with speech interfaces such as Alexa and Siri are of course common, but they are limited. Rather than adding mind reading skills, we introduced a ""cheat"" that enabled our systems to fake it. The cheat is simple and only slightly interesting to computer scientists and not at all interesting to philosophers. However, reading about the enactivist idea that we ""directly perceive"" the intentions of others, our cheat took on a new light and in this paper look again at how natural language understanding might actually work between humans."			arxiv	[]	426.0
874	Independent Learning in Stochastic Games	Asuman Ozdaglar	2021-11-23 09:27:20	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11743v1	Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently achieved tremendous successes in many artificial intelligence applications. Many of the forefront applications of RL involve multiple agents, e.g., playing chess and Go games, autonomous driving, and robotics. Unfortunately, the framework upon which classical RL builds is inappropriate for multi-agent learning, as it assumes an agent's environment is stationary and does not take into account the adaptivity of other agents. In this review paper, we present the model of stochastic games for multi-agent learning in dynamic environments. We focus on the development of simple and independent learning dynamics for stochastic games: each agent is myopic and chooses best-response type actions to other agents' strategy without any coordination with her opponent. There has been limited progress on developing convergent best-response type independent learning dynamics for stochastic games. We present our recently proposed simple and independent learning dynamics that guarantee convergence in zero-sum stochastic games, together with a review of other contemporaneous algorithms for dynamic multi-agent learning in this setting. Along the way, we also reexamine some classical results from both the game theory and RL literature, to situate both the conceptual contributions of our independent learning dynamics, and the mathematical novelties of our analysis. We hope this review paper serves as an impetus for the resurgence of studying independent and natural learning dynamics in game theory, for the more challenging settings with a dynamic environment.			arxiv	['Muhammed O.

875	Characterization of 128x128 MM-PAD-2.1 ASIC: A Fast Framing Hard X-Ray Detector with High Dynamic Range	D. Gadkari	2021-11-30 22:35:45	http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00146v2	We characterize a new x-ray Mixed-Mode Pixel Array Detector (MM-PAD-2.1) Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). Using an integrating pixel front-end with dynamic charge removal architecture, the MM-PAD-2.1 ASIC extends the maximum measurable x-ray signal (in 20 keV photon units) to > 10$^{7}$ x-rays/pixel/frame while maintaining a low read noise across the full dynamic range, all while imaging continuously at a frame rate of up to 10 kHz. The in-pixel dynamic charge removal mechanism prevents saturation of the input amplifier and proceeds in parallel with signal integration to achieve deadtime-less measurements with incident x-ray rates of > 10$^{10}$ x-rays/pixel/s. The ASIC format consists of 128$\times$128 square pixels each 150 $\mu$m on a side and is designed to be 3-side buttable so large arrays can be effectively tiled. Here we use both laboratory x-ray sources and the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) to characterize two single ASIC prototype detectors for both low (single x-ray) and high incident flux detection. In the first detector the ASIC was solder bump-bonded to a 500 $\mu$m thick Si sensor for efficient detection of x-rays below ~20 keV, whereas the second detector used a 750 $\mu$m thick CdTe sensor for x-rays above $\sim$ 20 keV.			arxiv	['K.

Approaches using search and learning produced strong performance across many perfect information games, and approaches using game-theoretic reasoning and learning demonstrated strong performance for specific imperfect information poker variants. We introduce Student of Games, a general-purpose algorithm that unifies previous approaches, combining guided search, self-play learning, and game-theoretic reasoning. Student of Games achieves strong empirical performance in large perfect and imperfect information games -- an important step towards truly general algorithms for arbitrary environments. We prove that Student of Games is sound, converging to perfect play as available computation and approximation capacity increases. Student of Games reaches strong performance in chess and Go, beats the strongest openly available agent in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker, and defeats the state-of-the-art agent in Scotland Yard, an imperfect information game that illustrates the value of guided search, learning, and game-theoretic reasoning.			arxiv	['Matej Moravcik', 'Neil Burch', 'Rudolf Kadlec', 'Josh Davidson', 'Kevin Waugh', 'Nolan Bard', 'Finbarr Timbers', 'Marc Lanctot', 'G.

877	Quantum Model Learning Agent: characterisation of quantum systems through machine learning	Brian Flynn	2021-12-15 19:01:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08409v1	Accurate models of real quantum systems are important for investigating their behaviour, yet are difficult to distill empirically. Here, we report an algorithm -- the Quantum Model Learning Agent (QMLA) -- to reverse engineer Hamiltonian descriptions of a target system. We test the performance of QMLA on a number of simulated experiments, demonstrating several mechanisms for the design of candidate Hamiltonian models and simultaneously entertaining numerous hypotheses about the nature of the physical interactions governing the system under study. QMLA is shown to identify the true model in the majority of instances, when provided with limited a priori information, and control of the experimental setup. Our protocol can explore Ising, Heisenberg and Hubbard families of models in parallel, reliably identifying the family which best describes the system dynamics. We demonstrate QMLA operating on large model spaces by incorporating a genetic algorithm to formulate new hypothetical models. The selection of models whose features propagate to the next generation is based upon an objective function inspired by the Elo rating scheme, typically used to rate competitors in games such as chess and football. In all instances, our protocol finds models that exhibit $F_1$-score $\geq 0.88$ when compared with the true model, and it precisely identifies the true model in 72% of cases, whilst exploring a space of over $250,000$ potential models. By testing which interactions actually occur in the target system, QMLA is a viable tool for both the exploration of fundamental physics and the characterisation and calibration of quantum devices.			arxiv	['Antonio Andreas Gentile', 'Nathan Wiebe', 'Raffaele Santagati', 'Anthony Laing']	430.0

By setting up the task so that it can be performed by humans, we are able to train models on the task using imitation learning, and then optimize answer quality with human feedback. To make human evaluation of factual accuracy easier, models must collect references while browsing in support of their answers. We train and evaluate our models on ELI5, a dataset of questions asked by Reddit users. Our best model is obtained by fine-tuning GPT-3 using behavior cloning, and then performing rejection sampling against a reward model trained to predict human preferences. This model's answers are preferred by humans 56% of the time to those of our human demonstrators, and 69% of the time to the highest-voted answer from Reddit.			arxiv	['Jacob Hilton', 'Suchir Balaji', 'Jeff Wu', 'Long Ouyang', 'Christina Kim', 'Christopher Hesse', 'Shantanu Jain', 'Vineet Kosaraju', 'William Saunders', 'Xu Jiang', 'Karl Cobbe', 'Tyna Eloundou', 'Gretchen Krueger', 'Kevin Button', 'Matthew Knight', 'Benjamin Chess', 'John Schulman']	431.0
879	On the Evolution of the MCTS Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees by Means of Evolutionary Algorithms in the Game of Carcassonne	Edgar Galv√°n	2021-12-17 18:06:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09697v1	Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a sampling best-first method to search for optimal decisions. The MCTS's popularity is based on its extraordinary results in the challenging two-player based game Go, a game considered much harder than Chess and that until very recently was considered infeasible for Artificial Intelligence methods. The success of MCTS depends heavily on how the tree is built and the selection process plays a fundamental role in this. One particular selection mechanism that has proved to be reliable is based on the Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees, commonly referred as UCT. The UCT attempts to nicely balance exploration and exploitation by considering the values stored in the statistical tree of the MCTS. However, some tuning of the MCTS UCT is necessary for this to work well. In this work, we use Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to evolve mathematical expressions with the goal to substitute the UCT mathematical expression. We compare our proposed approach, called Evolution Strategy in MCTS (ES-MCTS) against five variants of the MCTS UCT, three variants of the star-minimax family of algorithms as well as a random controller in the Game of Carcassonne. We also use a variant of our proposed EA-based controller, dubbed ES partially integrated in MCTS. We show how the ES-MCTS controller, is able to outperform all these 10 intelligent controllers, including robust MCTS UCT controllers.			arxiv	['Gavin Simpson']	432.0

We conceptualize of international relations as a strategic chess game between adversaries and develop a systematic way to measure pieces, moves, and gambits accurately and consistently over a hundred years of history. We introduce a new ontology and dataset of international events called ICBe based on a very high-quality corpus of narratives from the International Crisis Behavior (ICB) Project. We demonstrate that ICBe has higher coverage, recall, and precision than existing state of the art datasets and conduct two detailed case studies of the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962) and Crimea-Donbas Crisis (2014). We further introduce two new event visualizations (event icongraphy and crisis maps), an automated benchmark for measuring event recall using natural language processing (sythnetic narratives), and an ontology reconstruction task for objectively measuring event precision. We make the data, online appendix, replication material, and visualizations of every historical episode available at a companion website www.crisisevents.org and the github repository.			arxiv	['Thomas Leo Scherer', 'J.

881	Impartial Games: A Challenge for Reinforcement Learning	Bei Zhou	2022-05-25 14:02:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12787v3	While AlphaZero-style reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms excel in various board games, in this paper we show that they face challenges on impartial games where players share pieces. We present a concrete example of a game - namely the children's game of Nim - and other impartial games that seem to be a stumbling block for AlphaZero-style and similar self-play reinforcement learning algorithms. Our work is built on the challenges posed by the intricacies of data distribution on the ability of neural networks to learn parity functions, exacerbated by the noisy labels issue. Our findings are consistent with recent studies showing that AlphaZero-style algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and adversarial perturbations, showing the difficulty of learning to master the games in all legal states. We show that Nim can be learned on small boards, but the learning progress of AlphaZero-style algorithms dramatically slows down when the board size increases. Intuitively, the difference between impartial games like Nim and partisan games like Chess and Go can be explained by the fact that if a small part of the board is covered for impartial games it is typically not possible to predict whether the position is won or lost as there is often zero correlation between the visible part of a partly blanked-out position and its correct evaluation. This situation starkly contrasts partisan games where a partly blanked-out board position typically provides abundant or at least non-trifle information about the value of the fully uncovered position.			arxiv	['S√∏ren Riis']	434.0
882	ESCHER: Eschewing Importance Sampling in Games by Computing a History Value Function to Estimate Regret	Stephen McAleer	2022-06-08 18:43:45	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04122v2	Recent techniques for approximating Nash equilibria in very large games leverage neural networks to learn approximately optimal policies (strategies). One promising line of research uses neural networks to approximate counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) or its modern variants. DREAM, the only current CFR-based neural method that is model free and therefore scalable to very large games, trains a neural network on an estimated regret target that can have extremely high variance due to an importance sampling term inherited from Monte Carlo CFR (MCCFR). In this paper we propose an unbiased model-free method that does not require any importance sampling. Our method, ESCHER, is principled and is guaranteed to converge to an approximate Nash equilibrium with high probability. We show that the variance of the estimated regret of ESCHER is orders of magnitude lower than DREAM and other baselines. We then show that ESCHER outperforms the prior state of the art -- DREAM and neural fictitious self play (NFSP) -- on a number of games and the difference becomes dramatic as game size increases. In the very large game of dark chess, ESCHER is able to beat DREAM and NFSP in a head-to-head competition over $90\%$ of the time.			arxiv	['Gabriele Farina', 'Marc Lanctot', 'Tuomas Sandholm']	435.0
883	Brick Tic-Tac-Toe: Exploring the Generalizability of AlphaZero to Novel Test Environments	John Tan Chong Min	2022-07-13 06:53:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05991v2	Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) environments typically are the same for both the training and testing phases. Hence, current RL methods are largely not generalizable to a test environment which is conceptually similar but different from what the method has been trained on, which we term the novel test environment. As an effort to push RL research towards algorithms which can generalize to novel test environments, we introduce the Brick Tic-Tac-Toe (BTTT) test bed, where the brick position in the test environment is different from that in the training environment. Using a round-robin tournament on the BTTT environment, we show that traditional RL state-search approaches such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Minimax are more generalizable to novel test environments than AlphaZero is. This is surprising because AlphaZero has been shown to achieve superhuman performance in environments such as Go, Chess and Shogi, which may lead one to think that it performs well in novel test environments. Our results show that BTTT, though simple, is rich enough to explore the generalizability of AlphaZero. We find that merely increasing MCTS lookahead iterations was insufficient for AlphaZero to generalize to some novel test environments. Rather, increasing the variety of training environments helps to progressively improve generalizability across all possible starting brick configurations.			arxiv	['Mehul Motani']	436.0
884	On the Convergence of Monte Carlo UCB for Random-Length Episodic MDPs	Zixuan Dong	2022-09-07 00:21:45	http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02864v1	In reinforcement learning, Monte Carlo algorithms update the Q function by averaging the episodic returns. In the Monte Carlo UCB (MC-UCB) algorithm, the action taken in each state is the action that maximizes the Q function plus a UCB exploration term, which biases the choice of actions to those that have been chosen less frequently. Although there has been significant work on establishing regret bounds for MC-UCB, most of that work has been focused on finite-horizon versions of the problem, for which each episode terminates after a constant number of steps. For such finite-horizon problems, the optimal policy depends both on the current state and the time within the episode. However, for many natural episodic problems, such as games like Go and Chess and robotic tasks, the episode is of random length and the optimal policy is stationary. For such environments, it is an open question whether the Q-function in MC-UCB will converge to the optimal Q function; we conjecture that, unlike Q-learning, it does not converge for all MDPs. We nevertheless show that for a large class of MDPs, which includes stochastic MDPs such as blackjack and deterministic MDPs such as Go, the Q-function in MC-UCB converges almost surely to the optimal Q function. An immediate corollary of this result is that it also converges almost surely for all finite-horizon MDPs. We also provide numerical experiments, providing further insights into MC-UCB.			arxiv	['Che Wang', 'Keith Ross']	437.0

A rating system is a procedure by which player ratings are adjusted upwards each time they win, or downwards each time they lose. Many matchmaking systems give players some control over their opponent's rating; for example, a player might be able to selectively initiate matches against opponents whose ratings are publicly visible, or abort a match without penalty before it begins but after glimpsing their opponent's rating. It is natural to ask whether one can design a rating system that does not incentivize a rating-maximizing player to act strategically, seeking matches against opponents of one rating over another. We show the following: - The full version of this ""opponent indifference"" property is unfortunately too strong to be feasible. Although it is satisfied by some rating systems, these systems lack certain desirable expressiveness properties, suggesting that they are not suitable to capture most games of interest. - However, there is a natural relaxation, roughly requiring indifference between any two opponents who are ``reasonably evenly matched'' with the choosing player. We prove that this relaxed variant of opponent indifference, which we call $P$ opponent indifference, is viable. In fact, a certain strong version of $P$ opponent indifference precisely characterizes the rating system Sonas, which was originally proposed for its empirical predictive accuracy on the outcomes of high-level chess matches."			arxiv	['Forest Zhang']	438.0

However, while there have been several attempts to train transformers on different domains, there is usually a clear relationship between these domains, e.g.,, code summarization, where the natural language summary describes the code. There have been very few attempts to study how multi-task transfer learning works on tasks in significantly different domains. In this project, we investigated the behavior of multi-domain, multi-task learning using multi-domain text-to-text transfer transformers (MD-T5) on four tasks across two domains - Python Code and Chess. We carried out extensive experiments using three popular training strategies: Bert-style joint pretraining + successive finetuning, GPT-style joint pretraining + successive finetuning, and GPT-style joint pretraining + joint finetuning. Also, we evaluate the model on four metrics - Play Score, Eval Score, BLEU Score, and Multi-Domain Learning Score (MDLS). These metrics measure performance across the various tasks and multi-domain learning. We show that while negative knowledge transfer and catastrophic forgetting are still considerable challenges for all the models, the GPT-style joint pretraining + joint finetuning strategy showed the most promise in multi-domain, multi-task learning as it performs well across all four tasks while still keeping its multi-domain knowledge.			arxiv	['Courage Ekoh', 'Germann Atakpa', 'Yonah Byaruagaba']	439.0
887	Continuous Monte Carlo Graph Search	Kalle Kujanp√§√§	2022-10-04 07:34:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01426v2	In many complex sequential decision-making tasks, online planning is crucial for high performance. For efficient online planning, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) employs a principled mechanism for trading off exploration for exploitation. MCTS outperforms comparison methods in many discrete decision-making domains such as Go, Chess, and Shogi. Following, extensions of MCTS to continuous domains have been proposed. However, the inherent high branching factor and the resulting explosion of search tree size are limiting existing methods. To address this problem, we propose Continuous Monte Carlo Graph Search (CMCGS), a novel extension of MCTS to online planning in environments with continuous state and action spaces. CMCGS takes advantage of the insight that, during planning, sharing the same action policy between several states can yield high performance. To implement this idea, at each time step, CMCGS clusters similar states into a limited number of stochastic action bandit nodes, which produce a layered directed graph instead of an MCTS search tree. Experimental evaluation shows that CMCGS outperforms comparable planning methods in several complex continuous DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks and a 2D navigation task with limited sample budgets. Furthermore, CMCGS can be parallelized to scale up and it outperforms the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) in continuous control with learned dynamics models.			arxiv	['Amin Babadi', 'Yi Zhao', 'Juho Kannala', 'Alexander Ilin', 'Joni Pajarinen']	440.0
888	Mastering the Game of No-Press Diplomacy via Human-Regularized Reinforcement Learning and Planning	Anton Bakhtin	2022-10-11 14:47:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05492v1	No-press Diplomacy is a complex strategy game involving both cooperation and competition that has served as a benchmark for multi-agent AI research. While self-play reinforcement learning has resulted in numerous successes in purely adversarial games like chess, Go, and poker, self-play alone is insufficient for achieving optimal performance in domains involving cooperation with humans. We address this shortcoming by first introducing a planning algorithm we call DiL-piKL that regularizes a reward-maximizing policy toward a human imitation-learned policy. We prove that this is a no-regret learning algorithm under a modified utility function. We then show that DiL-piKL can be extended into a self-play reinforcement learning algorithm we call RL-DiL-piKL that provides a model of human play while simultaneously training an agent that responds well to this human model. We used RL-DiL-piKL to train an agent we name Diplodocus. In a 200-game no-press Diplomacy tournament involving 62 human participants spanning skill levels from beginner to expert, two Diplodocus agents both achieved a higher average score than all other participants who played more than two games, and ranked first and third according to an Elo ratings model.			arxiv	['David J Wu', 'Adam Lerer', 'Jonathan Gray', 'Athul Paul Jacob', 'Gabriele Farina', 'Alexander H Miller', 'Noam Brown']	441.0
889	Evaluation Beyond Task Performance: Analyzing Concepts in AlphaZero in Hex	Charles Lovering	2022-11-26 21:59:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14673v1	AlphaZero, an approach to reinforcement learning that couples neural networks and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), has produced state-of-the-art strategies for traditional board games like chess, Go, shogi, and Hex. While researchers and game commentators have suggested that AlphaZero uses concepts that humans consider important, it is unclear how these concepts are captured in the network. We investigate AlphaZero's internal representations in the game of Hex using two evaluation techniques from natural language processing (NLP): model probing and behavioral tests. In doing so, we introduce new evaluation tools to the RL community and illustrate how evaluations other than task performance can be used to provide a more complete picture of a model's strengths and weaknesses. Our analyses in the game of Hex reveal interesting patterns and generate some testable hypotheses about how such models learn in general. For example, we find that MCTS discovers concepts before the neural network learns to encode them. We also find that concepts related to short-term end-game planning are best encoded in the final layers of the model, whereas concepts related to long-term planning are encoded in the middle layers of the model.			arxiv	['Jessica Zosa Forde', 'George Konidaris', 'Ellie Pavlick', 'Michael L.

890	Phase behaviour of coarse-grained fluids	Vlad P Sokhan	2023-01-01 20:06:25	http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00465v2	Soft condensed matter structures often challenge us with complex many-body phenomena governed by collective modes spanning wide spatial and temporal domains. In order to successfully tackle such problems mesoscopic coarse-grained (CG) statistical models are being developed, providing a dramatic reduction in computational complexity. CG models provide an intermediate step in the complex statistical framework of linking the thermodynamics of condensed phases with the properties of their constituent atoms and molecules. These allow us to offload part of the problem to the CG model itself and reformulate the remainder in terms of reduced CG phase space. However, such exchange of pawns to chess pieces, or ``Hamiltonian renormalization'', is a radical step and the thermodynamics of the primary atomic and CG models could be markedly different. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the phase diagram including binodal and interfacial properties of a novel soft CG model, which includes finite-range attraction and supports liquid phases. Although the model is rooted in similar arguments to the Lennard-Jones (LJ) atomic pair potential, its phase behaviour is qualitatively different from that of LJ and features several anomalies such as an unusually broad liquid range, change in concavity of the liquid coexistence branch with variation of the model parameters, volume contraction on fusion, temperature of maximum density in the liquid phase and negative thermal expansion in the solid phase. These results provide new insight into the connection between simple potential models and complex emergent condensed matter phenomena.			arxiv	['Michael A Seaton', 'Ilian T Todorov']	443.0
891	Generalization through Diversity: Improving Unsupervised Environment Design	Wenjun Li	2023-01-19 11:55:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08025v2	Agent decision making using Reinforcement Learning (RL) heavily relies on either a model or simulator of the environment (e.g., moving in an 8x8 maze with three rooms, playing Chess on an 8x8 board). Due to this dependence, small changes in the environment (e.g., positions of obstacles in the maze, size of the board) can severely affect the effectiveness of the policy learned by the agent. To that end, existing work has proposed training RL agents on an adaptive curriculum of environments (generated automatically) to improve performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) test scenarios. Specifically, existing research has employed the potential for the agent to learn in an environment (captured using Generalized Advantage Estimation, GAE) as the key factor to select the next environment(s) to train the agent. However, such a mechanism can select similar environments (with a high potential to learn) thereby making agent training redundant on all but one of those environments. To that end, we provide a principled approach to adaptively identify diverse environments based on a novel distance measure relevant to environment design. We empirically demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our method in comparison to multiple leading approaches for unsupervised environment design on three distinct benchmark problems used in literature.			arxiv	['Pradeep Varakantham', 'Dexun Li']	444.0
892	Equivariant MuZero	Andreea Deac	2023-02-09 17:46:29	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04798v1	Deep reinforcement learning repeatedly succeeds in closed, well-defined domains such as games (Chess, Go, StarCraft). The next frontier is real-world scenarios, where setups are numerous and varied. For this, agents need to learn the underlying rules governing the environment, so as to robustly generalise to conditions that differ from those they were trained on. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms, such as the highly successful MuZero, aim to accomplish this by learning a world model. However, leveraging a world model has not consistently shown greater generalisation capabilities compared to model-free alternatives. In this work, we propose improving the data efficiency and generalisation capabilities of MuZero by explicitly incorporating the symmetries of the environment in its world-model architecture. We prove that, so long as the neural networks used by MuZero are equivariant to a particular symmetry group acting on the environment, the entirety of MuZero's action-selection algorithm will also be equivariant to that group. We evaluate Equivariant MuZero on procedurally-generated MiniPacman and on Chaser from the ProcGen suite: training on a set of mazes, and then testing on unseen rotated versions, demonstrating the benefits of equivariance. Further, we verify that our performance improvements hold even when only some of the components of Equivariant MuZero obey strict equivariance, which highlights the robustness of our construction.			arxiv	['Th√©ophane Weber', 'George Papamakarios']	445.0
893	Targeted Search Control in AlphaZero for Effective Policy Improvement	Alexandre Trudeau	2023-02-23 22:50:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12359v2	AlphaZero is a self-play reinforcement learning algorithm that achieves superhuman play in chess, shogi, and Go via policy iteration. To be an effective policy improvement operator, AlphaZero's search requires accurate value estimates for the states appearing in its search tree. AlphaZero trains upon self-play matches beginning from the initial state of a game and only samples actions over the first few moves, limiting its exploration of states deeper in the game tree. We introduce Go-Exploit, a novel search control strategy for AlphaZero. Go-Exploit samples the start state of its self-play trajectories from an archive of states of interest. Beginning self-play trajectories from varied starting states enables Go-Exploit to more effectively explore the game tree and to learn a value function that generalizes better. Producing shorter self-play trajectories allows Go-Exploit to train upon more independent value targets, improving value training. Finally, the exploration inherent in Go-Exploit reduces its need for exploratory actions, enabling it to train under more exploitative policies. In the games of Connect Four and 9x9 Go, we show that Go-Exploit learns with a greater sample efficiency than standard AlphaZero, resulting in stronger performance against reference opponents and in head-to-head play. We also compare Go-Exploit to KataGo, a more sample efficient reimplementation of AlphaZero, and demonstrate that Go-Exploit has a more effective search control strategy. Furthermore, Go-Exploit's sample efficiency improves when KataGo's other innovations are incorporated.			arxiv	['Michael Bowling']	446.0

A Vision-and-Language Benchmark of Synthetic and Compositional Images	Nitzan Bitton-Guetta	2023-03-13 16:49:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07274v4	Weird, unusual, and uncanny images pique the curiosity of observers because they challenge commonsense. For example, an image released during the 2022 world cup depicts the famous soccer stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo playing chess, which playfully violates our expectation that their competition should occur on the football field. Humans can easily recognize and interpret these unconventional images, but can AI models do the same? We introduce WHOOPS!, a new dataset and benchmark for visual commonsense. The dataset is comprised of purposefully commonsense-defying images created by designers using publicly-available image generation tools like Midjourney. We consider several tasks posed over the dataset. In addition to image captioning, cross-modal matching, and visual question answering, we introduce a difficult explanation generation task, where models must identify and explain why a given image is unusual. Our results show that state-of-the-art models such as GPT3 and BLIP2 still lag behind human performance on WHOOPS!. We hope our dataset will inspire the development of AI models with stronger visual commonsense reasoning abilities.

895	The Update Equivalence Framework for Decision-Time Planning	Samuel Sokota	2023-04-25 20:28:55	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13138v1	The process of revising (or constructing) a policy immediately prior to execution -- known as decision-time planning -- is key to achieving superhuman performance in perfect-information settings like chess and Go. A recent line of work has extended decision-time planning to more general imperfect-information settings, leading to superhuman performance in poker. However, these methods requires considering subgames whose sizes grow quickly in the amount of non-public information, making them unhelpful when the amount of non-public information is large. Motivated by this issue, we introduce an alternative framework for decision-time planning that is not based on subgames but rather on the notion of update equivalence. In this framework, decision-time planning algorithms simulate updates of synchronous learning algorithms. This framework enables us to introduce a new family of principled decision-time planning algorithms that do not rely on public information, opening the door to sound and effective decision-time planning in settings with large amounts of non-public information. In experiments, members of this family produce comparable or superior results compared to state-of-the-art approaches in Hanabi and improve performance in 3x3 Abrupt Dark Hex and Phantom Tic-Tac-Toe.			arxiv	['Gabriele Farina', 'David J.

896	Transferable Curricula through Difficulty Conditioned Generators	Sidney Tio	2023-06-22 16:45:45	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13028v1	"Advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated superhuman performance in complex tasks such as Starcraft, Go, Chess etc. However, knowledge transfer from Artificial ""Experts"" to humans remain a significant challenge. A promising avenue for such transfer would be the use of curricula. Recent methods in curricula generation focuses on training RL agents efficiently, yet such methods rely on surrogate measures to track student progress, and are not suited for training robots in the real world (or more ambitiously humans). In this paper, we introduce a method named Parameterized Environment Response Model (PERM) that shows promising results in training RL agents in parameterized environments. Inspired by Item Response Theory, PERM seeks to model difficulty of environments and ability of RL agents directly. Given that RL agents and humans are trained more efficiently under the ""zone of proximal development"", our method generates a curriculum by matching the difficulty of an environment to the current ability of the student. In addition, PERM can be trained offline and does not employ non-stationary measures of student ability, making it suitable for transfer between students. We demonstrate PERM's ability to represent the environment parameter space, and training with RL agents with PERM produces a strong performance in deterministic environments. Lastly, we show that our method is transferable between students, without any sacrifice in training quality."			arxiv	['Pradeep Varakantham']	449.0

However, most UWB localization systems today require multiple anchors in the environment, which can be very cumbersome to set up. In this work, we develop XRLoc, providing an accuracy of a few centimeters in many real-world scenarios. This paper will delineate the key ideas which allow us to overcome the fundamental restrictions that plague a single anchor point from localization of a device to within an error of a few centimeters. We deploy a VR chess game using everyday objects as a demo and find that our system achieves $2.4$ cm median accuracy and $5.3$ cm $90^\mathrm{th}$ percentile accuracy in dynamic scenarios, performing at least $8\times$ better than state-of-art localization systems. Additionally, we implement a MAC protocol to furnish these locations for over $10$ tags at update rates of $100$ Hz, with a localization latency of $\sim 1$ ms.			arxiv	['Shunsuke Saruwatari', 'Sureel Shah', 'Dinesh Bharadia']	450.0

We investigate how to utilize Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to solve the problem. Although MCTS was shown to demonstrate superior performance in a wide range of problems like playing antagonistic games (e.g. Go, Chess etc.), discovering faster matrix multiplication algorithms etc., its application to the problem at hand was not well studied before. To this end we introduce an original variant of MCTS, tailored to multi-agent pathfinding. The crux of our approach is how the reward, that guides MCTS, is computed. Specifically, we use individual paths to assist the agents with the the goal-reaching behavior, while leaving them freedom to get off the track if it is needed to avoid collisions. We also use a dedicated decomposition technique to reduce the branching factor of the tree search procedure. Empirically we show that the suggested method outperforms the baseline planning algorithm that invokes heuristic search, e.g. A*, at each re-planning step.			arxiv	['Alexey Skrynnik', 'Anton Andreychuk', 'Konstantin Yakovlev', 'Aleksandr Panov']	451.0
899	Analysis of ELO Rating Scheme in MOBA Games	Yuhan Song	2023-10-18 03:38:41	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13719v1	ELO rating system is proposed by Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-American physics professor. Originally, it was proposed for the ranking system of chess players, but it was soon adapted to many other zero-sum sports fields like football, baseball, basketball , etc. Nowadays, besides the traditional sports games, computer/video games are also playing an important role in social lives especially among the teenagers. In most of the online competition games, player's performance is usually scored and recorded by the game's ranking system. Meanwhile, ranking system like ladder in Dota is not the only the metric for the players to evaluate their gaming strength, an ELO rating score based on players in-game performance is also a decisive factor for gamers' matching. Namely, the matching system will refer to players' score in the ranking system and performance score system to ensure the matched players will promisingly undergo a balanced game without one team dramatically overwhelming the other. ELO scheme and its variants in modern online competition games aims to ensuring the expected winning rate for each team approaches 50\%. However, ELO rating is also causing compliments among players. In this research, I will dig into the advantages and drawbacks of leveraging ELO ranking system in online games and why it is still employed by game developers despite the fact that it is disliked by most of the players. Also, a new effort based rating scheme will be proposed and compared with ELO scheme under the simulation environment.			arxiv	[]	452.0
900	Chain of Images for Intuitively Reasoning	Fanxu Meng	2023-11-09 11:14:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09241v1	The human brain is naturally equipped to comprehend and interpret visual information rapidly. When confronted with complex problems or concepts, we use flowcharts, sketches, and diagrams to aid our thought process. Leveraging this inherent ability can significantly enhance logical reasoning. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs) do not utilize such visual intuition to help their thinking. Even the most advanced version language models (e.g., GPT-4V and LLaVA) merely align images into textual space, which means their reasoning processes remain purely verbal. To mitigate such limitations, we present a Chain of Images (CoI) approach, which can convert complex language reasoning problems to simple pattern recognition by generating a series of images as intermediate representations. Furthermore, we have developed a CoI evaluation dataset encompassing 15 distinct domains where images can intuitively aid problem-solving. Based on this dataset, we aim to construct a benchmark to assess the capability of future multimodal large-scale models to leverage images for reasoning. In supporting our CoI reasoning, we introduce a symbolic multimodal large language model (SyMLLM) that generates images strictly based on language instructions and accepts both text and image as input. Experiments on Geometry, Chess and Common Sense tasks sourced from the CoI evaluation dataset show that CoI improves performance significantly over the pure-language Chain of Thoughts (CoT) baselines.

However, it has been demonstrated time and again that these techniques fail to capture semantic context and logical constraints, instead often relying on spurious correlations to arrive at the answer. Since application of deep learning techniques to critical scenarios are dependent on adherence to domain specific constraints, several attempts have been made to address this issue. One limitation holding back a thorough exploration of this area, is a lack of suitable datasets which feature a rich set of rules. In order to address this, we present the ChessVision Dataset, consisting of 200,000+ images of annotated chess games in progress, requiring recreation of the game state from its corresponding image. This is accompanied by a curated set of rules which constrains the set of predictions to ""reasonable"" game states, and are designed to probe key semantic abilities like localization and enumeration. Alongside standard metrics, additional metrics to measure performance with regards to logical consistency is presented. We analyze several popular and state of the art vision models on this task, and show that, although their performance on standard metrics are laudable, they produce a plethora of incoherent results, indicating that this dataset presents a significant challenge for future works."			arxiv	['Utpal Garain']	454.0

In this paper, we specifically focus on controlling the heating system of a residential building to optimize its energy consumption while respecting user's thermal comfort. Recent works in this area have mainly focused on either model-based control, e.g., model predictive control (MPC), or model-free reinforcement learning (RL) to implement practical DR algorithms. A specific RL method that recently has achieved impressive success in domains such as board games (go, chess) is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Yet, for building control it has remained largely unexplored. Thus, we study MCTS specifically for building demand response. Its natural structure allows a flexible optimization that implicitly integrate exogenous constraints (as opposed, for example, to conventional RL solutions), making MCTS a promising candidate for DR control problems. We demonstrate how to improve MCTS control performance by incorporating a Physics-informed Neural Network (PiNN) model for its underlying thermal state prediction, as opposed to traditional purely data-driven Black-Box approaches. Our MCTS implementation aligned with a PiNN model is able to obtain a 3% increment of the obtained reward compared to a rule-based controller; leading to a 10% cost reduction and 35% reduction on temperature difference with the desired one when applied to an artificial price profile. We further implemented a Deep Learning layer into the Monte Carlo Tree Search technique using a neural network that leads the tree search through more optimal nodes. We then compared this addition with its Vanilla version, showing the improvement in computational cost required.			arxiv	['Gargya Gokhale', 'Bert Claessens', 'Chris Develder']	455.0
903	Weak-to-Strong Generalization: Eliciting Strong Capabilities With Weak Supervision	Collin Burns	2023-12-14 23:07:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09390v1	Widely used alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), rely on the ability of humans to supervise model behavior - for example, to evaluate whether a model faithfully followed instructions or generated safe outputs. However, future superhuman models will behave in complex ways too difficult for humans to reliably evaluate; humans will only be able to weakly supervise superhuman models. We study an analogy to this problem: can weak model supervision elicit the full capabilities of a much stronger model? We test this using a range of pretrained language models in the GPT-4 family on natural language processing (NLP), chess, and reward modeling tasks. We find that when we naively finetune strong pretrained models on labels generated by a weak model, they consistently perform better than their weak supervisors, a phenomenon we call weak-to-strong generalization. However, we are still far from recovering the full capabilities of strong models with naive finetuning alone, suggesting that techniques like RLHF may scale poorly to superhuman models without further work. We find that simple methods can often significantly improve weak-to-strong generalization: for example, when finetuning GPT-4 with a GPT-2-level supervisor and an auxiliary confidence loss, we can recover close to GPT-3.5-level performance on NLP tasks. Our results suggest that it is feasible to make empirical progress today on a fundamental challenge of aligning superhuman models.			arxiv	['Pavel Izmailov', 'Jan Hendrik Kirchner', 'Bowen Baker', 'Leo Gao', 'Leopold Aschenbrenner', 'Yining Chen', 'Adrien Ecoffet', 'Manas Joglekar', 'Jan Leike', 'Ilya Sutskever', 'Jeff Wu']	456.0
904	A study of deuterated water in the low-mass protostar IRAS16293-2422	Audrey Coutens	2012-01-09 14:43:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1785v2	The HDO/H2O ratio is a powerful diagnostic to understand the evolution of water from the first stages of star formation to the formation of planets and comets. Our aim is to determine precisely the abundance distribution of HDO towards the low-mass protostar IRAS16293-2422 and learn more about the water formation mechanisms by determining the HDO/H2O abundance ratio. A spectral survey of the source IRAS16293-2422 was carried out in the framework of the CHESS Herschel Key program with the HIFI instrument, allowing the detection of numerous HDO lines. Other transitions have been observed previously with ground-based telescopes. The spherical Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RATRAN was used to reproduce the observed line profiles of HDO by assuming an abundance jump. To determine the H2O abundance throughout the envelope, a similar study was made of the H2-18O observed lines, as the H2O main isotope lines are contaminated by the outflows. We derive an inner HDO abundance of 1.7e-7 and an outer HDO abundance of 8e-11. To reproduce the HDO absorption lines, it is necessary to add an absorbing layer in front of the envelope. It may correspond to a water-rich layer created by the photodesorption of the ices at the edges of the molecular cloud. The HDO/H2O ratio is ~1.4-5.8% in the hot corino whereas it is ~0.2-2.2% in the outer envelope. It is estimated at ~4.8% in the added absorbing layer. Although it is clearly higher than the cosmic D/H abundance, the HDO/H2O ratio remains lower than the D/H ratio derived for other deuterated molecules observed in the same source. The similarity of the ratios derived in the hot corino and in the added absorbing layer suggests that water formed before the gravitational collapse of the protostar, contrary to formaldehyde and methanol, which formed later once the CO molecules had depleted on the grains.			arxiv	['Charlotte Vastel', 'Emmanuel Caux', 'Cecilia Ceccarelli', 'Sandrine Bottinelli', 'Laurent Wiesenfeld', 'Alexandre Faure', 'Yohann Scribano', 'Claudine Kahane']	457.0

Zernickel	2012-08-27 21:43:29	http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5516v1	We aim at deriving the molecular abundances and temperatures of the hot molecular cores in the high-mass star-forming region NGC 6334I and consequently deriving their physical and astrochemical conditions. In the framework of the Herschel guaranteed time key program CHESS, NGC 6334I is investigated by using HIFI aboard the Herschel Space Observatory. A spectral line survey is carried out in the frequency range 480-1907 GHz, and auxiliary interferometric data from the SMA in the 230 GHz band provide spatial information for disentangling the different physical components contributing to the HIFI spectrum. The spectral lines are identified with the aid of former surveys and spectral line catalogs. The observed spectrum is then compared to a simulated synthetic spectrum with XCLASS, assuming local thermal equilibrium, and best fit parameters are derived using the model optimization package MAGIX. A total of 46 molecules are identified, with 31 isotopologues, resulting in about 4300 emission and absorption lines. High- energy levels of the dominant emitter methanol and vibrationally excited HCN are detected. The number of unidentified lines remains low with 75, or less than 2 percent of the lines detected. The modeling suggests that several spectral features need two or more components to be fitted properly. Other components could be assigned to cold foreground clouds or to outflows, most visible in the SiO emission. A chemical variation between the two embedded hot cores is found, with more N-bearing molecules identified in SMA1 and O-bearing molecules in SMA2. Spectral line surveys give powerful insights into the study of the interstellar medium. Different molecules trace different physical conditions like the inner hot core, the envelope, the outflows or the cold foreground clouds. The derived molecular abundances provide further constraints for astrochemical models.			arxiv	['P. Schilke', 'A. Schmiedeke', 'D. C. Lis', 'C. L. Brogan', 'C. Ceccarelli', 'C. Comito', 'M.

906	Rank Centrality: Ranking from Pair-wise Comparisons	Sahand Negahban	2012-09-08 04:42:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1688v4	The question of aggregating pair-wise comparisons to obtain a global ranking over a collection of objects has been of interest for a very long time: be it ranking of online gamers (e.g. MSR's TrueSkill system) and chess players, aggregating social opinions, or deciding which product to sell based on transactions. In most settings, in addition to obtaining a ranking, finding `scores' for each object (e.g. player's rating) is of interest for understanding the intensity of the preferences. In this paper, we propose Rank Centrality, an iterative rank aggregation algorithm for discovering scores for objects (or items) from pair-wise comparisons. The algorithm has a natural random walk interpretation over the graph of objects with an edge present between a pair of objects if they are compared; the score, which we call Rank Centrality, of an object turns out to be its stationary probability under this random walk. To study the efficacy of the algorithm, we consider the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model (equivalent to the Multinomial Logit (MNL) for pair-wise comparisons) in which each object has an associated score which determines the probabilistic outcomes of pair-wise comparisons between objects. In terms of the pair-wise marginal probabilities, which is the main subject of this paper, the MNL model and the BTL model are identical. We bound the finite sample error rates between the scores assumed by the BTL model and those estimated by our algorithm. In particular, the number of samples required to learn the score well with high probability depends on the structure of the comparison graph. When the Laplacian of the comparison graph has a strictly positive spectral gap, e.g. each item is compared to a subset of randomly chosen items, this leads to dependence on the number of samples that is nearly order-optimal.			arxiv	['Sewoong Oh', 'Devavrat Shah']	459.0

Coutens	2013-04-10 09:50:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2890v1	Context: Despite the low elemental deuterium abundance in the Galaxy, enhanced molecular D/H ratios have been found in the environments of low-mass star-forming regions and, in particular, the Class 0 protostar IRAS 16293-2422. Aims: The key program Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions (CHESS) aims at studying the molecular complexity of the interstellar medium. The high sensitivity and spectral resolution of the Herschel/HIFI instrument provide a unique opportunity to observe the fundamental 1_{1,1}-0_{0,0} transition of ortho-D2O at 607 GHz and the higher energy 2_{1,2}-1_{0,1} transition of para-D2O at 898 GHz, both of which are inaccessible from the ground. Methods: The ortho-D2O transition at 607 GHz was previously detected. We present in this paper the first tentative detection for the para-D2O transition at 898 GHz. The spherical Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RATRAN was used to reproduce the observed line profiles of D2O with the same method that was used to reproduce the HDO and H2-18O line profiles in IRAS 16293-2422. Results: As for HDO, the absorption component seen on the D2O lines can only be reproduced by adding an external absorbing layer, possibly created by the photodesorption of the ices at the edges of the molecular cloud. The D2O column density is found to be about 2.5e12 cm^{-2} in this added layer, leading to a D2O/H2O ratio of about 0.5%. At a 3 sigma uncertainty, upper limits of 0.03% and 0.2% are obtained for this ratio in the hot corino and the colder envelope of IRAS 16293-2422, respectively. Conclusions: The deuterium fractionation derived in our study suggests that the ices present in IRAS 16293-2422 formed on warm dust grains (~15-20 K) in dense (~1e4-5e4 cm^{-3}) translucent clouds. These results allow us to address the earliest phases of star formation and the conditions in which ices form.			arxiv	['C. Vastel', 'S. Cazaux', 'S. Bottinelli', 'E. Caux', 'C. Ceccarelli', 'K.

908	The CHESS survey of the L1157-B1 bow-shock: high and low excitation water vapor	G. Busquet	2013-11-12 17:11:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2840v1	"Molecular outflows powered by young protostars strongly affect the kinematics and chemistry of the natal molecular cloud through strong shocks resulting in substantial modifications of the abundance of several species. As part of the ""Chemical Herschel Surveys of Star forming regions"" guaranteed time key program, we aim at investigating the physical and chemical conditions of H20 in the brightest shock region B1 of the L1157 molecular outflow. We observed several ortho- and para-H2O transitions using HIFI and PACS instruments on board Herschel, providing a detailed picture of the kinematics and spatial distribution of the gas. We performed a LVG analysis to derive the physical conditions of H2O shocked material, and ultimately obtain its abundance. We detected 13 H2O lines probing a wide range of excitation conditions. PACS maps reveal that H2O traces weak and extended emission associated with the outflow identified also with HIFI in the o-H2O line at 556.9 GHz, and a compact (~10"") bright, higher-excitation region. The LVG analysis of H2O lines in the bow-shock show the presence of two gas components with different excitation conditions: a warm (Tkin~200-300 K) and dense (n(H2)~(1-3)x10^6 cm-3) component with an assumed extent of 10"" and a compact (~2""-5"") and hot, tenuous (Tkin~900-1400 K, n(H2)~10^3-10^4 cm-3) gas component, which is needed to account for the line fluxes of high Eu transitions. The fractional abundance of the warm and hot H2O gas components is estimated to be (0.7-2)x10^{-6} and (1-3)x10^{-4}, respectively. Finally, we identified an additional component in absorption in the HIFI spectra of H2O lines connecting with the ground state level, probably arising from the photodesorption of icy mantles of a water-enriched layer at the edges of the cloud."			arxiv	['B.

909	The density structure of the L1157 molecular outflow	A. I. G√≥mez-Ruiz	2014-10-30 17:21:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8453v1	We present a multiline CS survey towards the brightest bow-shock B1 in the prototypical chemically active protostellar outflow L1157. We made use of (sub-)mm data obtained in the framework of the Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions (CHESS) and Astrochemical Surveys at IRAM (ASAI) key science programs. We detected $^{12}$C$^{32}$S, $^{12}$C$^{34}$S, $^{13}$C$^{32}$S, and $^{12}$C$^{33}$S emissions, for a total of 18 transitions, with $E_{\rm u}$ up to $\sim$ 180 K. The unprecedented sensitivity of the survey allows us to carefully analyse the line profiles, revealing high-velocity emission, up to 20 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the systemic. The profiles can be well fitted by a combination of two exponential laws that are remarkably similar to what previously found using CO. These components have been related to the cavity walls produced by the $\sim$ 2000 yr B1 shock and the older ($\sim$ 4000 yr) B2 shock, respectively. The combination of low- and high-excitation CS emission was used to properly sample the different physical components expected in a shocked region. Our CS observations show that this molecule is highlighting the dense, $n_{\rm H_2}$ = 1--5 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$, cavity walls produced by the episodic outflow in L1157. In addition, the highest excitation (E$_u$ $\geq$ 130 K) CS lines provide us with the signature of denser (1--5 $\times$ 10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas, associated with a molecular reformation zone of a dissociative J-type shock, which is expected to arise where the precessing jet impacting the molecular cavities. The CS fractional abundance increases up to $\sim$ 10$^{-7}$ in all the kinematical components. This value is consistent with what previously found for prototypical protostars and it is in agreement with the prediction of the abundances obtained via the chemical code Astrochem.			arxiv	['C.

910	The HIFI spectral survey of AFGL 2591 (CHESS). III. Chemical structure of the protostellar envelope	Maja Kazmierczak-Barthel	2014-12-18 09:07:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5763v1	We aim to understand the rich chemical composition of AFGL 2591, a prototypical isolated high-mass star-forming region. Based on HIFI and JCMT data, the molecular abundances of species found in the protostellar envelope of AFGL 2591 were derived with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RATRAN, assuming either constant values or 1D stepwise radial profiles as abundance distributions. The reconstructed 1D abundances were compared with the results of time-dependent gas-grain chemical modeling, considering ages of 10,000 to 50,000 years, cosmic-ray ionization rates of 0.5 to 50 times 10^-16 s^-1, uniformly-sized 0.1-1 micron dust grains, a dust/gas ratio of 1%, and several sets of initial molecular abundances with C/O <1 and >1. Constant abundance models give good fits to the data for CO, CN, CS, HCO+, H2CO, N2H+, C2H, NO, OCS, OH, H2CS, O, C, C+, and CH. Models with an abundance jump at 100 K give good fits to the data for NH3, SO, SO2, H2S, H2O, HCl, and CH3OH. For HCN and HNC, the best models have an abundance jump at 230 K. The time-dependent chemical model can accurately explain abundance profiles of 15 out of these 24 species. The jump-like radial profiles for key species like HCO+, NH3, and H2O are consistent with the outcome of the time-dependent chemical modeling. The best-fit model has a chemical age of 10-50 kyr, a solar C/O ratio of 0.44, and a cosmic-ray ionization rate of 5 x 10^-17 s^-1; grain properties and external UV intensity do not affect the calculated chemical structure much. We thus demonstrate that simple constant or jump-like abundance profiles agree with time-dependent chemical modeling for most key C-, O-, N-, and S-bearing molecules. The main exceptions are species with very few observed transitions (C, O, C+, and CH), with a poorly established chemical network (HCl, H2S) or whose chemistry is strongly affected by surface processes (CH3OH).			arxiv	['Dimitri Semenov', 'Floris van der Tak', 'Luis Chavarr√≠a', 'Matthijs van der Wiel']	463.0
911	Stratified NH and ND emission in the prestellar core 16293E in L1689N	A. Bacmann	2015-12-08 20:50:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02629v1	High degrees of deuterium fractionation are commonly found in cold prestellar cores and in the envelopes around young protostars. As it brings strong constraints to chemical models, deuterium chemistry is often used to infer core history or molecule formation pathways. Whereas a large number of observations is available regarding interstellar deuterated stable molecules, relatively little is known about the deuteration of hydride radicals, as their fundamental rotational transitions are at high frequencies where the atmosphere is mostly opaque. Nitrogen hydride radicals are important species in nitrogen chemistry, as they are thought to be related to ammonia formation. Observations have shown that ammonia is strongly deuterated, with [NH2D]/[NH3] ~ 10%. Models predict similarly high [ND]/[NH] ratios, but so far only one observational determination of this ratio is available, towards the envelope of the protostar IRAS16293-2422. In order to test model predictions, we aim here at determining [ND]/[NH] in a dense, starless core. We observed NH and ND in 16293E with the HIFI spectrometer on board the Herschel Space Observatory as part of the CHESS guaranteed time key programme, and derived the abundances of these two species using a non-LTE non-local radiative transfer model. Both NH and ND are detected in the source, with ND in emission and NH in absorption against the continuum arising from the cold dust emission. Our model shows however that the ND emission and the NH absorption originate from different layers in the cloud, as further evidenced by their different velocities. In the central region of the core, we can set a lower limit to the [ND]/[NH] ratio of ~2%. This estimate is consistent with recent pure gas-phase models of nitrogen chemistry			arxiv	['F.

912	H2S in the L1157-B1 Bow shock	Jonathan Holdship	2016-08-05 19:36:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01983v1	Sulfur-bearing molecules are highly reactive in the gas phase of the ISM. However, the form in which most of the sulfur is locked onto interstellar dust grains is unknown. By taking advantage of the short time-scales of shocks in young molecular outflows, one could track back the main form of sulfur in the ices. In this paper, six transitions of H$_2$S and its isotopologues in the L1157-B1 bowshock have been detected using data from the Herschel-CHESS survey and the IRAM-30m ASAI large program. These detections are used to calculate the properties of H$_2$S gas in L1157-B1 through use of a rotation diagram and to explore the possible carriers of sulfur on the grains. The isotopologue detections allow the first calculation of the H$_2$S deuteration fraction in an outflow from a low mass protostar. The fractional abundance of H$_2$S in the region is found to be 6.0$\times$10$^{-7}$ and the deuteration fraction is 2$\times$10$^{-2}$. In order to investigate the form of sulfur on the grains, a chemical model is run with four different networks, each with different branching ratios for the freeze out of sulfur bearing species into molecules such as OCS and H$_2$S. It is found that the model best fits the data when at least half of each sulfur bearing species hydrogenates when freezing. We therefore conclude that a significant fraction of sulfur in L1157-B1 is likely to be locked in H$_2$S on the grains.			arxiv	['Serena Viti', 'Izaskun Jimenez-Serra', 'Bertrand Lefloch', 'Claudio Codella', 'Linda Podio', 'Milena Benedettini', 'Francesco Fontani', 'Rafael Bachiller', 'Mario Tafalla', 'Cecilia Ceccarelli']	465.0
913	Cooperating with Machines	Jacob W. Crandall	2017-03-17 21:50:16	http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06207v5	Since Alan Turing envisioned Artificial Intelligence (AI) [1], a major driving force behind technical progress has been competition with human cognition. Historical milestones have been frequently associated with computers matching or outperforming humans in difficult cognitive tasks (e.g. face recognition [2], personality classification [3], driving cars [4], or playing video games [5]), or defeating humans in strategic zero-sum encounters (e.g. Chess [6], Checkers [7], Jeopardy! [8], Poker [9], or Go [10]). In contrast, less attention has been given to developing autonomous machines that establish mutually cooperative relationships with people who may not share the machine's preferences. A main challenge has been that human cooperation does not require sheer computational power, but rather relies on intuition [11], cultural norms [12], emotions and signals [13, 14, 15, 16], and pre-evolved dispositions toward cooperation [17], common-sense mechanisms that are difficult to encode in machines for arbitrary contexts. Here, we combine a state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithm with novel mechanisms for generating and acting on signals to produce a new learning algorithm that cooperates with people and other machines at levels that rival human cooperation in a variety of two-player repeated stochastic games. This is the first general-purpose algorithm that is capable, given a description of a previously unseen game environment, of learning to cooperate with people within short timescales in scenarios previously unanticipated by algorithm designers. This is achieved without complex opponent modeling or higher-order theories of mind, thus showing that flexible, fast, and general human-machine cooperation is computationally achievable using a non-trivial, but ultimately simple, set of algorithmic mechanisms.			arxiv	['Mayada Oudah', 'Tennom', 'Fatimah Ishowo-Oloko', 'Sherief Abdallah', 'Jean-Fran√ßois Bonnefon', 'Manuel Cebrian', 'Azim Shariff', 'Michael A.

914	The onset of energetic particle irradiation in Class 0 protostars	C. Favre	2017-08-28 09:29:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08247v1	The early stages of low-mass star formation are likely to be subject to intense ionization by protostellar energetic MeV particles. As a result, the surrounding gas is enriched in molecular ions, such as HCO$^{+}$ and N$_{2}$H$^{+}$. Nonetheless, this phenomenon remains poorly understood for Class 0 objects. Recently, based on Herschel observations taken as part of the key program Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions (CHESS), a very low HCO$^{+}$/N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ abundance ratio of about 3-4, has been reported toward the protocluster OMC-2 FIR4. This finding suggests a cosmic-ray ionization rate in excess of 10$^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$, much higher than the canonical value of $\zeta$ = 3$\times$10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$ (value expected in quiescent dense clouds). To assess the specificity of OMC-2 FIR4, we have extended this study to a sample of sources in low- and intermediate mass. More specifically, we seek to measure the HCO$^{+}$/N$_2$H$^{+}$ abundance ratio from high energy lines (J $\ge$ 6) toward this source sample in order to infer the flux of energetic particles in the warm and dense gas surrounding the protostars. We use observations performed with the Heterodyne Instrument for the FarInfrared spectrometer on board the Herschel Space Observatory toward a sample of 9 protostars. We report HCO$^{+}$/N$_2$H$^{+}$ abundance ratios in the range of 5 up to 73 toward our source sample. The large error bars do not allow us to conclude whether OMC-2~FIR4 is a peculiar source. Nonetheless, an important result is that the measured HCO$^{+}$/N$_2$H$^{+}$ ratio does not vary with the source luminosity. At the present time, OMC-2 FIR4 remains the only source where a high flux of energetic particles is clearly evident. More sensitive and higher angular resolution observations are required to further investigate this process.			arxiv	['A. Lopez-Sepulcre', 'C. Ceccarelli', 'C. Dominik', 'P. Caselli', 'E. Caux', 'A.

915	Probing Light Atoms at Sub-nanometer Resolution: Realization of Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope Holography	Fehmi S. Yasin	2018-07-31 00:44:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01016v1	Atomic resolution imaging in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning TEM (STEM) of light elements in electron-transparent materials has long been a challenge. Biomolecular materials, for example, are rapidly altered when illuminated with electrons. These issues have driven the development of TEM and STEM techniques that enable the structural analysis of electron beam-sensitive and weakly scattering nano-materials. Here, we demonstrate such a technique, STEM holography, capable of absolute phase and amplitude object wave measurement with respect to a vacuum reference wave. We use an amplitude-dividing nanofabricated grating to prepare multiple spatially separated electron diffraction probe beams focused at the sample plane, such that one beam transmits through the specimen while the others pass through vacuum. We raster-scan the diffracted probes over the region of interest. We configure the post specimen imaging system of the microscope to diffraction mode, overlapping the probes to form an interference pattern at the detector. Using a fast-readout, direct electron detector, we record and analyze the interference fringes at each position in a 2D raster scan to reconstruct the complex transfer function of the specimen, t(x). We apply this technique to image a standard target specimen consisting of gold nanoparticles on a thin amorphous carbon substrate, and demonstrate 2.4 angstrom resolution phase images. We find that STEM holography offers higher phase-contrast of the amorphous material while maintaining Au atomic lattice resolution when compared with high angle annular dark field STEM.			arxiv	['Tyler R.

916	Measuring Human Assessed Complexity in Synthetic Aperture Sonar Imagery Using the Elo Rating System	Brian Reinhardt	2018-08-15 20:06:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05279v1	Performance of automatic target recognition from synthetic aperture sonar data is heavily dependent on the complexity of the beamformed imagery. Several mechanisms can contribute to this, including unwanted vehicle dynamics, the bathymetry of the scene, and the presence of natural and manmade clutter. To understand the impact of the environmental complexity on image perception, researchers have taken approaches rooted in information theory, or heuristics. Despite these efforts, a quantitative measure for complexity has not been related to the phenomenology from which it is derived. By using subject matter experts (SMEs) we derive a complexity metric for a set of imagery which accounts for the underlying phenomenology. The goal of this work is to develop an understanding of how several common information theoretic and heuristic measures are related to the SME perceived complexity in synthetic aperture sonar imagery. To achieve this, an ensemble of 10-meter x 10-meter images were cropped from a high-frequency SAS data set that spans multiple environments. The SME's were presented pairs of images from which they could rate the relative image complexity. These comparisons were then converted into the desired sequential ranking using a method first developed by A. Elo for establishing rankings of chess players. The Elo method produced a plausible rank ordering across the broad dataset. The heuristic and information theoretical metrics were then compared to the image rank from which they were derived. The metrics with the highest degree of correlation were those relating to spatial information, e.g. variations in pixel intensity, with an R-squared value of approximately 0.9. However, this agreement was dependent on the scale from which the spatial variation was measured. Results will also be presented for many other measures including lacunarity, image compression, and entropy.			arxiv	['Isaac Gerg', 'Daniel Brown', 'Joonho Park']	469.0
917	Wythoff's Game with a Pass	Ryohei Miyadera	2017-11-14 05:52:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04960v1	The author introduces the Wythoff game with a pass, a variant of the classical Wythoff game. The latter game is played with two piles of stones, and two players take turns removing stones from one or both piles; when removing stones from both piles, the numbers of stones removed from each pile must be equal. The player who removes the last stone or stones is the winner. An equivalent description of the game is that a single chess queen is placed somewhere on a large grid of squares, and each player can move the queen towards the upper left corner of the grid: leftward, upward, or to the upper left, any number of steps. The winner is the player who moves the queen into the upper left corner. In Wythoff's game with a pass, we modify the standard rules of the game so as to allow for a one-time pass, i.e., a pass move which may be used at most once in a game, and not from a terminal position. Once the pass has been used by either player, it is no longer available. The author discovered that, when a pass move is available, the set of $\mathcal{P}$-positions (previsous player's position) of the Wythoff's game with a pass is equal to $ T_0 \cup T_1\cup B -A$, where $T_0 = \{(x,y): \mathcal{G}(x,y)=0 \}$, $T_0 = \{(x,y): \mathcal{G}(x,y)=1 \}$, $B$ is a finite subset of $\{(x,y): \mathcal{G}(x,y)=4 \}$, $A$ is a finite subset of $T_0$ and $\mathcal{G}$ is the Grundy number of the classical Wythoff game. Here the size of $B$ is $6$, and the size of $A$ is $7$. According to the research of U.Blass and A.S.Fraenkel, for a position $(x,y) \in T_1 $ there is always a position $(x^{\prime},y^{\prime}) \in T_0$ such that $\mid x- x^{\prime} \mid \leq 2$ and $\mid y - y^{\prime} \mid \leq 4$, and hence the graph of the set of $\mathcal{P}$-positions of the Wythoff's game with a pass is very similar to the graph of the set of $\mathcal{P}$-positions of the classical Wythoff's game.			arxiv	[]	470.0
918	Developing an OpenAI Gym-compatible framework and simulation environment for testing Deep Reinforcement Learning agents solving the Ambulance Location Problem	Michael Allen	2021-01-12 12:10:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04434v2	Background and motivation: Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) is a rapidly developing field. Historically most application has been made to games (such as chess, Atari games, and go). Deep RL is now reaching the stage where it may offer value in real world problems, including optimisation of healthcare systems. One such problem is where to locate ambulances between calls in order to minimise time from emergency call to ambulance on-scene. This is known as the Ambulance Location problem. Aim: To develop an OpenAI Gym-compatible framework and simulation environment for testing Deep RL agents. Methods: A custom ambulance dispatch simulation environment was developed using OpenAI Gym and SimPy. Deep RL agents were built using PyTorch. The environment is a simplification of the real world, but allows control over the number of clusters of incident locations, number of possible dispatch locations, number of hospitals, and creating incidents that occur at different locations throughout each day. Results: A range of Deep RL agents based on Deep Q networks were tested in this custom environment. All reduced time to respond to emergency calls compared with random allocation to dispatch points. Bagging Noisy Duelling Deep Q networks gave the most consistence performance. All methods had a tendency to lose performance if trained for too long, and so agents were saved at their optimal performance (and tested on independent simulation runs). Conclusions: Deep RL agents, developed using simulated environments, have the potential to offer a novel approach to optimise the Ambulance Location problem. Creating open simulation environments should allow more rapid progress in this field.			arxiv	['Kerry Pearn', 'Tom Monks']	471.0
919	Graph complements of circular graphs	Oliver Knill	2021-01-18 04:56:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06873v1	Graph complements G(n) of cyclic graphs are circulant, vertex-transitive, claw-free, strongly regular, Hamiltonian graphs with a Z(n) symmetry, Shannon capacity 2 and known Wiener and Harary index. There is an explicit spectral zeta function and tree or forest data. The forest-tree ratio converges to e. The graphs G(n) are Cayley graphs and so Platonic with isomorphic unit spheres G(n-3)^+, complements of path graphs. G(3d+3) are homotop to wedge sums of two d-spheres and G(3d+2),G(3d+4) are homotop to d-spheres, G(3d+1)^+ are contractible, G(3d+2)^+,G(3d+3)^+ are d-spheres. Since disjoint unions are dual to Zykov joins, graph complements of 1-dimensional discrete manifolds G are homotop to a point, a sphere or a wedge sums of spheres. If the length of every connected component of a 1-manifold is not divisible by 3, the graph complement of G is a sphere. In general, the graph complement of a forest is either contractible or a sphere. All induced strict subgraphs of G(n) are either contractible or homotop to spheres. The f-vectors G(n) or G(n)^+ satisfy a hyper Pascal triangle relation, the total number of simplices are hyper Fibonacci numbers. The simplex generating functions are Jacobsthal polynomials, generating functions of k-king configurations on a circular chess board. While the Euler curvature of circle complements G(n) is constant by symmetry, the discrete Gauss-Bonnet curvature of path complements G(n)^+ can be expressed explicitly from the generating functions. There is now a non-trivial 6 periodic Gauss-Bonnet curvature universality in the complement of Barycentric limits. The Brouwer-Lefschetz fixed point theorem produces a 12-periodicity of the Lefschetz numbers of all graph automorphisms of G(n). There is also a 12-periodicity of Wu characteristic. This is a 4 periodicity in dimension.These are manifestations of stable homotopy features, but combinatorial.			arxiv	[]	472.0
920	The HIFI spectral survey of AFGL2591 (CHESS). I. Highly excited linear rotor molecules in the high-mass protostellar envelope	M. H. D. van der Wiel	2013-03-14 04:03:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3339v1	We aim to reveal the gas energetics in the circumstellar environment of the prototypical high-mass protostellar object AFGL2591 using space-based far-infrared observations of linear rotor molecules. Rotational spectral line signatures of CO, HCO+, CS, HCN and HNC from a 490-1240 GHz survey with Herschel/HIFI, complemented by ground-based JCMT and IRAM 30m spectra, cover transitions with E(up)/k between 5 and ~300 K (750K for 12C16O, using selected frequency settings up to 1850 GHz). The resolved spectral line profiles are used to separate and study various kinematic components. The line profiles show two emission components, the widest and bluest of which is attributed to an approaching outflow and the other to the envelope. We find evidence for progressively more redshifted and wider line profiles from the envelope gas with increasing energy level, qualitatively explained by residual outflow contribution picked up in the systematically decreasing beam size. Integrated line intensities for each species decrease as E(up)/k increases from <50 to 700K. We constrain the following: n(H2)~10^5-10^6 cm^-3 and T~60-200K for the outflow gas; T=9-17K and N(H2)~3x10^21 cm^-2 for a known foreground absorption cloud; N(H2)<10^19 cm^-2 for a second foreground component. Our spherical envelope radiative transfer model systematically underproduces observed line emission at E(up)/k > 150 K for all species. This indicates that warm gas should be added to the model and that the model's geometry should provide low optical depth pathways for line emission from this warm gas to escape, for example in the form of UV heated outflow cavity walls viewed at a favorable inclination angle. Physical and chemical conditions derived for the outflow gas are similar to those in the protostellar envelope, possibly indicating that the modest velocity (<10 km/s) outflow component consists of recently swept-up gas.			arxiv	['L.

921	Instrumentation for the Study of Low Emittance Tuning and Beam Dynamics at CESR	M. G. Billing	2017-10-05 01:02:37	http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01844v2	The Cornell Electron-positron Storage Ring (CESR) has been converted from a High Energy Physics electron-positron collider to operate as a dedicated synchrotron light source for the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) and to conduct accelerator physics research as a test accelerator, capable of studying topics relevant to future damping rings, colliders and light sources. Some of the specific topics that were targeted for the initial phase of operation of the storage ring in this mode for CESR as a Test Accelerator (CesrTA) included 1) tuning techniques to produce low emittance beams, 2) the study of electron cloud development in a storage ring and 3) intra-beam scattering effects. The complete conversion of CESR to CesrTA occurred over a several year period, described elsewhere. In addition to instrumentation for the storage ring, which was created for CesrTA, existing instrumentation was modified to facilitate the entire range of investigations to support these studies. Procedures were developed, often requiring coordinated measurements among different instruments. This paper describes the instruments utilized for the study of beam dynamics during the operation of CesrTA. The treatment of these instruments will remain fairly general in this paper as it focusses on an overview of the instruments themselves. Their interaction and inter-relationships during sequences of observations is found in a companion paper describing the associated measurement techniques. More detailed descriptions and detailed operational performance for some of the instrumentation may be found elsewhere and these will be referenced in the related sections of this paper.			arxiv	['J.

922	First detection of NHD and ND$_2$ in the interstellar medium	M. Melosso	2020-07-15 06:35:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07504v1	"Deuterium fractionation processes in the interstellar medium (ISM) have been shown to be highly efficient in the family of nitrogen hydrides. To date, observations were limited to ammonia (NH$_2$D, NHD$_2$, ND$_3$) and imidogen radical (ND) isotopologues. We want to explore the high frequency windows offered by the \emph{Herschel Space Observatory} to search for deuterated forms of amidogen radical NH$_2$ and to compare the observations against the predictions of our comprehensive gas-grain chemical model. Making use of the new molecular spectroscopy data recently obtained at high frequencies for NHD and ND$_2$, both isotopologues have been searched for in the spectral survey towards the class 0 IRAS 16293-2422, a source in which NH$_3$, NH and their deuterated variants have been previously detected. We used the observations carried out with HIFI (Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared) in the framework of the key program ""Chemical Herschel surveys of star forming regions"" (CHESS). We report the first detection of interstellar NHD and ND$_2$. Both species are observed in absorption against the continuum of the protostar. From the analysis of their hyperfine structure, accurate excitation temperature and column density values have been determined. The latter were combined with the column density of the parent species NH$_2$ to derive the deuterium fractionation in amidogen. The amidogen D/H ratio measured in the low-mass protostar IRAS 16293-2422 is comparable to the one derived for the related species imidogen and much higher than that observed for ammonia. Additional observations of these species will give more insights into the mechanism of ammonia formation and deuteration in the ISM. We finally indicate the current possibilities to further explore these species at submillimeter wavelengths."			arxiv	['L. Bizzocchi', 'O. Sipil√§', 'B. M. Giuliano', 'L. Dore', 'F.

923	Physically Embedded Planning Problems: New Challenges for Reinforcement Learning	Mehdi Mirza	2020-09-11 16:56:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05524v2	Recent work in deep reinforcement learning (RL) has produced algorithms capable of mastering challenging games such as Go, chess, or shogi. In these works the RL agent directly observes the natural state of the game and controls that state directly with its actions. However, when humans play such games, they do not just reason about the moves but also interact with their physical environment. They understand the state of the game by looking at the physical board in front of them and modify it by manipulating pieces using touch and fine-grained motor control. Mastering complicated physical systems with abstract goals is a central challenge for artificial intelligence, but it remains out of reach for existing RL algorithms. To encourage progress towards this goal we introduce a set of physically embedded planning problems and make them publicly available. We embed challenging symbolic tasks (Sokoban, tic-tac-toe, and Go) in a physics engine to produce a set of tasks that require perception, reasoning, and motor control over long time horizons. Although existing RL algorithms can tackle the symbolic versions of these tasks, we find that they struggle to master even the simplest of their physically embedded counterparts. As a first step towards characterizing the space of solution to these tasks, we introduce a strong baseline that uses a pre-trained expert game player to provide hints in the abstract space to an RL agent's policy while training it on the full sensorimotor control task. The resulting agent solves many of the tasks, underlining the need for methods that bridge the gap between abstract planning and embodied control.

924	Data vs classifiers, who wins?	Lucas F. F. Cardoso	2021-07-15 16:55:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07451v4	The experiments covered by Machine Learning (ML) must consider two important aspects to assess the performance of a model: datasets and algorithms. Robust benchmarks are needed to evaluate the best classifiers. For this, one can adopt gold standard benchmarks available in public repositories. However, it is common not to consider the complexity of the dataset when evaluating. This work proposes a new assessment methodology based on the combination of Item Response Theory (IRT) and Glicko-2, a rating system mechanism generally adopted to assess the strength of players (e.g., chess). For each dataset in a benchmark, the IRT is used to estimate the ability of classifiers, where good classifiers have good predictions for the most difficult test instances. Tournaments are then run for each pair of classifiers so that Glicko-2 updates performance information such as rating value, rating deviation and volatility for each classifier. A case study was conducted hereby which adopted the OpenML-CC18 benchmark as the collection of datasets and pool of various classification algorithms for evaluation. Not all datasets were observed to be really useful for evaluating algorithms, where only 10% were considered really difficult. Furthermore, the existence of a subset containing only 50% of the original amount of OpenML-CC18 was verified, which is equally useful for algorithm evaluation. Regarding the algorithms, the methodology proposed herein identified the Random Forest as the algorithm with the best innate ability.			arxiv	['Vitor C. A. Santos', 'Regiane S.

925	AlphaDDA: Strategies for Adjusting the Playing Strength of a Fully Trained AlphaZero System to a Suitable Human Training Partner	Kazuhisa Fujita	2021-11-11 15:15:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06266v4	Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved superhuman performance in board games such as Go, chess, and Othello (Reversi). In other words, the AI system surpasses the level of a strong human expert player in such games. In this context, it is difficult for a human player to enjoy playing the games with the AI. To keep human players entertained and immersed in a game, the AI is required to dynamically balance its skill with that of the human player. To address this issue, we propose AlphaDDA, an AlphaZero-based AI with dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA). AlphaDDA consists of a deep neural network (DNN) and a Monte Carlo tree search, as in AlphaZero. AlphaDDA learns and plays a game the same way as AlphaZero, but can change its skills. AlphaDDA estimates the value of the game state from only the board state using the DNN. AlphaDDA changes a parameter dominantly controlling its skills according to the estimated value. Consequently, AlphaDDA adjusts its skills according to a game state. AlphaDDA can adjust its skill using only the state of a game without any prior knowledge regarding an opponent. In this study, AlphaDDA plays Connect4, Othello, and 6x6 Othello with other AI agents. Other AI agents are AlphaZero, Monte Carlo tree search, the minimax algorithm, and a random player. This study shows that AlphaDDA can balance its skill with that of the other AI agents, except for a random player. The DDA ability of AlphaDDA is based on an accurate estimation of the value from the state of a game. We believe that the AlphaDDA approach for DDA can be used for any game AI system if the DNN can accurately estimate the value of the game state and we know a parameter controlling the skills of the AI system.			arxiv	[]	478.0
926	Explainability in reinforcement learning: perspective and position	Agneza Krajna	2022-03-22 09:00:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11547v1	Artificial intelligence (AI) has been embedded into many aspects of people's daily lives and it has become normal for people to have AI make decisions for them. Reinforcement learning (RL) models increase the space of solvable problems with respect to other machine learning paradigms. Some of the most interesting applications are in situations with non-differentiable expected reward function, operating in unknown or underdefined environment, as well as for algorithmic discovery that surpasses performance of any teacher, whereby agent learns from experimental experience through simple feedback. The range of applications and their social impact is vast, just to name a few: genomics, game-playing (chess, Go, etc.), general optimization, financial investment, governmental policies, self-driving cars, recommendation systems, etc. It is therefore essential to improve the trust and transparency of RL-based systems through explanations. Most articles dealing with explainability in artificial intelligence provide methods that concern supervised learning and there are very few articles dealing with this in the area of RL. The reasons for this are the credit assignment problem, delayed rewards, and the inability to assume that data is independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This position paper attempts to give a systematic overview of existing methods in the explainable RL area and propose a novel unified taxonomy, building and expanding on the existing ones. The position section describes pragmatic aspects of how explainability can be observed. The gap between the parties receiving and generating the explanation is especially emphasized. To reduce the gap and achieve honesty and truthfulness of explanations, we set up three pillars: proactivity, risk attitudes, and epistemological constraints. To this end, we illustrate our proposal on simple variants of the shortest path problem.			arxiv	['Mario Brcic', 'Tomislav Lipic', 'Juraj Doncevic']	479.0
927	Using Elo Rating as a Metric for Comparative Judgement in Educational Assessment	Andy Gray	2022-04-04 19:15:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01805v1	"Marking and feedback are essential features of teaching and learning, across the overwhelming majority of educational settings and contexts. However, it can take a great deal of time and effort for teachers to mark assessments, and to provide useful feedback to the students. Furthermore, it also creates a significant cognitive load on the assessors, especially in ensuring fairness and equity. Therefore, an alternative approach to marking called comparative judgement (CJ) has been proposed in the educational space. Inspired by the law of comparative judgment (LCJ). This pairwise comparison for as many pairs as possible can then be used to rank all submissions. Studies suggest that CJ is highly reliable and accurate while making it quick for the teachers. Alternative studies have questioned this claim suggesting that the process can increase bias in the results as the same submission is shown many times to an assessor for increasing reliability. Additionally, studies have also found that CJ can result in the overall marking process taking longer than a more traditional method of marking as information about many pairs must be collected. In this paper, we investigate Elo, which has been extensively used in rating players in zero-sum games such as chess. We experimented on a large-scale Twitter dataset on the topic of a recent major UK political event (""Brexit"", the UK's political exit from the European Union) to ask users which tweet they found funnier between a pair selected from ten tweets. Our analysis of the data reveals that the Elo rating is statistically significantly similar to the CJ ranking with a Kendall's tau score of 0.96 and a p-value of 1.5x10^(-5). We finish with an informed discussion regarding the potential wider application of this approach to a range of educational contexts."			arxiv	['Alma Rahat', 'Tom Crick', 'Stephen Lindsay', 'Darren Wallace']	480.0
928	Generalised agent for solving higher board states of tic tac toe using Reinforcement Learning	Bhavuk Kalra	2022-12-23 10:58:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12252v1	Tic Tac Toe is amongst the most well-known games. It has already been shown that it is a biased game, giving more chances to win for the first player leaving only a draw or a loss as possibilities for the opponent, assuming both the players play optimally. Thus on average majority of the games played result in a draw. The majority of the latest research on how to solve a tic tac toe board state employs strategies such as Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Co-Evolution, and Evolutionary Programming. But these approaches deal with a trivial board state of 3X3 and very little research has been done for a generalized algorithm to solve 4X4,5X5,6X6 and many higher states. Even though an algorithm exists which is Min-Max but it takes a lot of time in coming up with an ideal move due to its recursive nature of implementation. A Sample has been created on this link \url{https://bk-tic-tac-toe.herokuapp.com/} to prove this fact. This is the main problem that this study is aimed at solving i.e providing a generalized algorithm(Approximate method, Learning-Based) for higher board states of tic tac toe to make precise moves in a short period. Also, the code changes needed to accommodate higher board states will be nominal. The idea is to pose the tic tac toe game as a well-posed learning problem. The study and its results are promising, giving a high win to draw ratio with each epoch of training. This study could also be encouraging for other researchers to apply the same algorithm to other similar board games like Minesweeper, Chess, and GO for finding efficient strategies and comparing the results.			arxiv	[]	481.0
929	Moving on from the software engineers' gambit: an approach to support the defense of software effort estimates	Patr√≠cia Matsubara	2023-02-14 18:19:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07229v1	Pressure for higher productivity and faster delivery is increasingly pervading software organizations. This can lead software engineers to act like chess players playing a gambit -- making sacrifices of their technically sound estimates, thus submitting their teams to time pressure. In turn, time pressure can have varied detrimental effects, such as poor product quality and emotional distress, decreasing productivity, which leads to more time pressure and delays: a hard-to-stop vicious cycle. This reveals a need for moving on from the more passive strategy of yielding to pressure to a more active one of defending software estimates. Therefore, we propose an approach to support software estimators in acquiring knowledge on how to carry out such defense, by introducing negotiation principles encapsulated in a set of defense lenses, presented through a digital simulation. We evaluated the proposed approach through a controlled experiment with software practitioners from different companies. We collected data on participants' attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intentions to perform the defense of their estimates in light of the Theory of Planned Behavior. We employed a frequentist and a bayesian approach to data analysis. Results show improved scores among experimental group participants after engaging with the digital simulation and learning about the lenses. They were also more inclined to choose a defense action when facing pressure scenarios than a control group exposed to questions to reflect on the reasons and outcomes of pressure over estimates. Qualitative evidence reveals that practitioners perceived the set of lenses as useful in their current work environments. Collectively, these results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its perceived relevance for the industry, despite the low amount of time required to engage with it.			arxiv	['Igor Steinmacher', 'Bruno Gadelha', 'Tayana Conte']	482.0
930	Proving the existence of Euclidean knight's tours on $n \times n \times \cdots \times n$ chessboards for $n < 4$	Marco Rip√†	2023-09-18 10:18:20	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09639v1	The Knight's Tour problem consists of finding a Hamiltonian path for the knight on a given set of points so that the knight can visit exactly once every vertex of the mentioned set. In the present paper we provide a $5$-dimensional counterexample to the well-known statement that it is not ever possible for a knight to visit once every vertex of $C(3,k):=\{\underbrace{\{0,1,2\} \times \{0,1,2\}\times \cdots \times \{0,1,2\}}_\textrm{k-times}\}$ by performing a sequence of $3^k-1$ jumps of standard length, since the most accurate answer to the original question actually depends on which mathematical assumptions we are making at the beginning of the game, when we decide to extend a planar chess piece to the third dimension and above. Our counterintuitive outcome follows from the observation that we can alternatively define a $2$D knight as a piece that moves from one square to another on the chessboard by covering a fixed Euclidean distance of $\sqrt{5}$ so that also the statement of Theorem 3 in [Erde, J., Gol\'enia, B., & Gol\'enia, S. (2012), The closed knight tour problem in higher dimensions, The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics, 19(4), \#P9] does not hold anymore for such a Euclidean knight, as long as a $2 \times 2 \times \cdots \times 2$ chessboard with at least $2^7$ cells is given. Moreover, we construct a classical closed knight's tour on $C(3,4)-\{(1,1,1,1)\}$ whose arrival is at a distance of $2$ from $(1,1,1,1)$, and then we show a closed Euclidean knight's tour on $\{\{0,1\}\times\{0,1\}\times\{0,1\}\times\{0,1\}\times\{0,1\}\times\{0,1\}\times\{0,1\}\}\subseteq \mathbb{Z}^7$.			arxiv	[]	483.0
931	High-brightness and high-flux cold neutron source utilizing high-aspect ratio rectangular para-hydrogen moderators	Alexander Ioffe	2023-11-26 19:14:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15389v5	A novel cold neutron source employing chess-board or staircase assemblies of high-aspect ratio rectangular \hpara moderators is proposed. It is demonstrated that this design can generate neutron beams with higher intensity and brightness, up to approximately 2.5 times more than any para-hydrogen-based cold neutron source with an equal cold neutron beam cross-section made of a single moderator (flat or voluminous). Two limiting factors for this gain are identified: the limited volume of the high-density thermal neutron region surrounding the reactor core or spallation target, which imposes constraints on the total length of the moderator assembly, and the finite width of moderator walls. An analytic approach for calculating the brightness of para-hydrogen moderators is introduced. Because brightness gain originates from a near-the-surface effect resulting from the prevailing single collision process during thermal-to-cold neutron conversion, high-aspect ratio rectangular cold moderators offer a significant increase, up to a factor of 10, in cold neutron brightness. The obtained results are in excellent agreement with MCNP calculations. The concept of 'low-dimensionality' in moderators is explored, demonstrating that achieving a substantial increase in brightness necessitates moderators to be low-dimensional both geometrically, implying a high aspect ratio, and physically, requiring the moderator's smallest dimension to be smaller than the characteristic scale of moderator medium (about the mean free path for thermal neutrons). This explains why additional compression of the moderator along the longest direction, effectively giving it a tube-like shape, does not result in a significant brightness increase comparable to the flattening of moderator.			arxiv	['Petr Konik', 'Konstantin Batkov']	484.0
932	Taxation and Valuation	Leonid A. Levin	2000-12-18 03:02:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0012013v21	The greatest harm from highway robbers lies not in seized wallets but in inhibited travel. Similarly, incentives for tax-reducing strategies put much sand in the wheels of the economy. Demands to replace our monumental tax code with a simple, graceful one that does not distort economic incentives heat up periodically in political debate, but such dreams never materialize. A FUNDAMENTAL obstacle, not yet well understood in the economic literature, is the impossibility of objectively evaluating the tax base -- assets, income, etc. One can see this even in toy examples, say, trying to assess the value of a position in chess: great masters' assessments will all differ. Here computer theory can add an insight not provided by classical economics tools. A way around is to avoid evaluations by expressing the tax in natural units, not in cash. For publicly traded corporations, these could be corporate shares. I discuss a simple (postcard-sized in ALL details) corporate tax system that avoids ANY distortion of incentives. (Tax tools MEANT to influence corporate policies should be set as explicit separate taxes or credits, open to public scrutiny, not hidden between lines of an incomprehensible tax code.) Roughly, the~system is to periodically take a t*i fraction of shares to auction, where t is the tax rate, i is the interest rate. It replaces all income taxes on publicly traded corporations, their subsidiaries, and shareholders. The interest rate is defined via specially designed bonds, so that the whole system can be shown PRECISELY equivalent to a flat tax on INVESTMENT RETURN. Note that taxing the return DIRECTLY is impossible: it would invite manipulation of stock market~prices. The main feature is that nothing corporations and investors do can change their tax (t*i fraction of shares), so they would do business exactly the SAME WAY they would WITHOUT TAXES.			arxiv	[]	485.0
933	Herschel/HIFI observations of spectrally resolved methylidyne signatures toward the high-mass star-forming core NGC6334I	M. H. D. van der Wiel	2010-07-09 09:31:55	http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1539v3	In contrast to extensively studied dense star-forming cores, little is known about diffuse gas surrounding star-forming regions. We study molecular gas in the high-mass star-forming region NGC6334I, which contains diffuse, quiescent components that are inconspicuous in widely used molecular tracers such as CO. We present Herschel/HIFI observations of CH toward NGC6334I observed as part of the CHESS key program. HIFI resolves the hyperfine components of its J=3/2-1/2 transition, observed in both emission and absorption. The CH emission appears close to the systemic velocity of NGC6334I, while its measured linewidth of 3 km/s is smaller than previously observed in dense gas tracers such as NH3 and SiO. The CH abundance in the hot core is 7 10^-11, two to three orders of magnitude lower than in diffuse clouds. While other studies find distinct outflows in, e.g., CO and H2O toward NGC6334I, we do not detect outflow signatures in CH. To explain the absorption signatures, at least two absorbing components are needed at -3.0 and +6.5 km/s with N(CH)=7 10^13 and 3 10^13 cm^-2. Two additional absorbing clouds are found at +8.0 and 0.0 km/s, both with N(CH)=2 10^13 cm^-2. Turbulent linewidths for the four absorption components vary between 1.5 and 5.0 km/s in FWHM. We constrain physical properties of our CH clouds by matching our CH absorbers with other absorption signatures. In the hot core, molecules such as H2O and CO trace gas that is heated and dynamically influenced by outflow activity, whereas CH traces more quiescent material. The four CH absorbers have column densities and turbulent properties consistent with diffuse clouds: two are located near NGC6334, and two are unrelated foreground clouds. Local density and dynamical effects influence the chemical composition of physical components of NGC6334, causing some components to be seen in CH but not in other tracers, and vice versa.			arxiv	['F.

934	The distribution of water in the high-mass star-forming region NGC 6334I	M. Emprechtinger	2010-07-23 22:24:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.4226v1	We present observations of twelve rotational transitions of H2O-16, H2O-18, and H2O-17 toward the massive star-forming region NGC 6334 I, carried out with Herschel/HIFI as part of the guaranteed time key program Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions (CHESS). We analyze these observations to obtain insights into physical processes in this region. We identify three main gas components (hot core, cold foreground, and outflow) in NGC 6334 I and derive the physical conditions in these components. The hot core, identified by the emission in highly excited lines, shows a high excitation temperature of 200 K, whereas water in the foreground component is predominantly in the ortho- and para- ground states. The abundance of water varies between 4 10^-5 (outflow) and 10^-8 (cold foreground gas). This variation is most likely due to the freeze-out of water molecules onto dust grains. The H2O-18/H2O-17 abundance ratio is 3.2, which is consistent with the O-18/O-17 ratio determined from CO isotopologues. The ortho/para ratio in water appears to be relatively low 1.6(1) in the cold, quiescent gas, but close to the equilibrium value of three in the warmer outflow material (2.5(0.8)).			arxiv	['D. C.

Vastel	2010-07-26 09:36:01	http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.4410v1	Despite the low elemental deuterium abundance in the Galaxy, enhanced molecular D/H ratios have been found in the environments of low-mass star forming regions, and in particular the Class 0 protostar IRAS 16293-2422. The CHESS (Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions) Key Program aims at studying the molecular complexity of the interstellar medium. The high sensitivity and spectral resolution of the HIFI instrument provide a unique opportunity to observe the fundamental 1,1,1 - 0,0,0 transition of the ortho-D2O molecule, inaccessible from the ground, and to determine the ortho-to-para D2O ratio. We have detected the fundamental transition of the ortho-D2O molecule at 607.35 GHz towards IRAS 16293-2422. The line is seen in absorption with a line opacity of 0.62 +/- 0.11 (1 sigma). From the previous ground-based observations of the fundamental 1,1,0 - 1,0,1 transition of para-D2O seen in absorption at 316.80 GHz we estimate a line opacity of 0.26 +/- 0.05 (1 sigma). We show that the observed absorption is caused by the cold gas in the envelope of the protostar. Using these new observations, we estimate for the first time the ortho to para D2O ratio to be lower than 2.6 at a 3 sigma level of uncertainty, to be compared with the thermal equilibrium value of 2:1.			arxiv	['C.

Bacmann	2010-07-27 12:09:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.4691v1	In the past decade, much progress has been made in characterising the processes leading to the enhanced deuterium fractionation observed in the ISM and in particular in the cold, dense parts of star forming regions such as protostellar envelopes. Very high molecular D/H ratios have been found for saturated molecules and ions. However, little is known about the deuterium fractionation in radicals, even though simple radicals often represent an intermediate stage in the formation of more complex, saturated molecules. The imidogen radical NH is such an intermediate species for the ammonia synthesis in the gas phase. Herschel/HIFI represents a unique opportunity to study the deuteration and formation mechanisms of such species, which are not observable from the ground. We searched here for the deuterated radical ND in order to determine the deuterium fractionation of imidogen and constrain the deuteration mechanism of this species. We observed the solar-mass Class 0 protostar IRAS16293-2422 with the heterodyne instrument HIFI as part of the Herschel key programme CHESS (Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions). The deuterated form of the imidogen radical ND was detected and securely identified with 2 hyperfine component groups of its fundamental transition in absorption against the continuum background emitted from the nascent protostar. The 3 groups of hyperfine components of its hydrogenated counterpart NH were also detected in absorption. We derive a very high deuterium fractionation with an [ND]/[NH] ratio of between 30 and 100%. The deuterium fractionation of imidogen is of the same order of magnitude as that in other molecules, which suggests that an efficient deuterium fractionation mechanism is at play. We discuss two possible formation pathways for ND, by means of either the reaction of N+ with HD, or deuteron/proton exchange with NH.			arxiv	['E. Caux', 'P. Hily-Blant', 'B. Parise', 'L.

937	The methanol lines and hot core of OMC2-FIR4, an intermediate-mass protostar, with Herschel-HIFI	M. Kama	2010-08-15 11:02:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2513v1	In contrast with numerous studies on the physical and chemical structure of low- and high-mass protostars, much less is known about their intermediate-mass counterparts, a class of objects that could help to elucidate the mechanisms of star formation on both ends of the mass range. We present the first results from a rich HIFI spectral dataset on an intermediate-mass protostar, OMC2-FIR4, obtained in the CHESS (Chemical HErschel SurveyS of star forming regions) key programme. The more than 100 methanol lines detected between 554 and 961 GHz cover a range in upper level energy of 40 to 540 K. Our physical interpretation focusses on the hot core, but likely the cold envelope and shocked regions also play a role in reality, because an analysis of the line profiles suggests the presence of multiple emission components. An upper limit of 10^-6 is placed on the methanol abundance in the hot core, using a population diagram, large-scale source model and other considerations. This value is consistent with abundances previously seen in low-mass hot cores. Furthermore, the highest energy lines at the highest frequencies display asymmetric profiles, which may arise from infall around the hot core.			arxiv	['C. Dominik', 'S. Maret', 'F. van der Tak', 'E.

938	Language Models are Few-Shot Learners	Tom B. Brown	2020-05-28 17:29:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165v4	Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.			arxiv	['Benjamin Mann', 'Nick Ryder', 'Melanie Subbiah', 'Jared Kaplan', 'Prafulla Dhariwal', 'Arvind Neelakantan', 'Pranav Shyam', 'Girish Sastry', 'Amanda Askell', 'Sandhini Agarwal', 'Ariel Herbert-Voss', 'Gretchen Krueger', 'Tom Henighan', 'Rewon Child', 'Aditya Ramesh', 'Daniel M.

939	GPT-4 Technical Report	OpenAI	2023-03-15 17:15:04	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774v4	We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.			arxiv	"[':', 'Josh Achiam', 'Steven Adler', 'Sandhini Agarwal', 'Lama Ahmad', 'Ilge Akkaya', 'Florencia Leoni Aleman', 'Diogo Almeida', 'Janko Altenschmidt', 'Sam Altman', 'Shyamal Anadkat', 'Red Avila', 'Igor Babuschkin', 'Suchir Balaji', 'Valerie Balcom', 'Paul Baltescu', 'Haiming Bao', 'Mo Bavarian', 'Jeff Belgum', 'Irwan Bello', 'Jake Berdine', 'Gabriel Bernadett-Shapiro', 'Christopher Berner', 'Lenny Bogdonoff', 'Oleg Boiko', 'Madelaine Boyd', 'Anna-Luisa Brakman', 'Greg Brockman', 'Tim Brooks', 'Miles Brundage', 'Kevin Button', 'Trevor Cai', 'Rosie Campbell', 'Andrew Cann', 'Brittany Carey', 'Chelsea Carlson', 'Rory Carmichael', 'Brooke Chan', 'Che Chang', 'Fotis Chantzis', 'Derek Chen', 'Sully Chen', 'Ruby Chen', 'Jason Chen', 'Mark Chen', 'Ben Chess', 'Chester Cho', 'Casey Chu', 'Hyung Won Chung', 'Dave Cummings', 'Jeremiah Currier', 'Yunxing Dai', 'Cory Decareaux', 'Thomas Degry', 'Noah Deutsch', 'Damien Deville', 'Arka Dhar', 'David Dohan', 'Steve Dowling', 'Sheila Dunning', 'Adrien Ecoffet', 'Atty Eleti', 'Tyna Eloundou', 'David Farhi', 'Liam Fedus', 'Niko Felix', 'Sim√≥n Posada Fishman', 'Juston Forte', 'Isabella Fulford', 'Leo Gao', 'Elie Georges', 'Christian Gibson', 'Vik Goel', 'Tarun Gogineni', 'Gabriel Goh', 'Rapha Gontijo-Lopes', 'Jonathan Gordon', 'Morgan Grafstein', 'Scott Gray', 'Ryan Greene', 'Joshua Gross', 'Shixiang Shane Gu', 'Yufei Guo', 'Chris Hallacy', 'Jesse Han', 'Jeff Harris', 'Yuchen He', 'Mike Heaton', 'Johannes Heidecke', 'Chris Hesse', 'Alan Hickey', 'Wade Hickey', 'Peter Hoeschele', 'Brandon Houghton', 'Kenny Hsu', 'Shengli Hu', 'Xin Hu', 'Joost Huizinga', 'Shantanu Jain', 'Shawn Jain', 'Joanne Jang', 'Angela Jiang', 'Roger Jiang', 'Haozhun Jin', 'Denny Jin', 'Shino Jomoto', 'Billie Jonn', 'Heewoo Jun', 'Tomer Kaftan', '≈Åukasz Kaiser', 'Ali Kamali', 'Ingmar Kanitscheider', 'Nitish Shirish Keskar', 'Tabarak Khan', 'Logan Kilpatrick', 'Jong Wook Kim', 'Christina Kim', 'Yongjik Kim', 'Hendrik Kirchner', 'Jamie Kiros', 'Matt Knight', 'Daniel Kokotajlo', '≈Åukasz Kondraciuk', 'Andrew Kondrich', 'Aris Konstantinidis', 'Kyle Kosic', 'Gretchen Krueger', 'Vishal Kuo', 'Michael Lampe', 'Ikai Lan', 'Teddy Lee', 'Jan Leike', 'Jade Leung', 'Daniel Levy', 'Chak Ming Li', 'Rachel Lim', 'Molly Lin', 'Stephanie Lin', 'Mateusz Litwin', 'Theresa Lopez', 'Ryan Lowe', 'Patricia Lue', 'Anna Makanju', 'Kim Malfacini', 'Sam Manning', 'Todor Markov', 'Yaniv Markovski', 'Bianca Martin', 'Katie Mayer', 'Andrew Mayne', 'Bob McGrew', 'Scott Mayer McKinney', 'Christine McLeavey', 'Paul McMillan', 'Jake McNeil', 'David Medina', 'Aalok Mehta', 'Jacob Menick', 'Luke Metz', 'Andrey Mishchenko', 'Pamela Mishkin', 'Vinnie Monaco', 'Evan Morikawa', 'Daniel Mossing', 'Tong Mu', 'Mira Murati', 'Oleg Murk', 'David M√©ly', 'Ashvin Nair', 'Reiichiro Nakano', 'Rajeev Nayak', 'Arvind Neelakantan', 'Richard Ngo', 'Hyeonwoo Noh', 'Long Ouyang', '""Cullen OKeefe""', 'Jakub Pachocki', 'Alex Paino', 'Joe Palermo', 'Ashley Pantuliano', 'Giambattista Parascandolo', 'Joel Parish', 'Emy Parparita', 'Alex Passos', 'Mikhail Pavlov', 'Andrew Peng', 'Adam Perelman', 'Filipe de Avila Belbute Peres', 'Michael Petrov', 'Henrique Ponde de Oliveira Pinto', 'Michael', 'Pokorny', 'Michelle Pokrass', 'Vitchyr Pong', 'Tolly Powell', 'Alethea Power', 'Boris Power', 'Elizabeth Proehl', 'Raul Puri', 'Alec Radford', 'Jack Rae', 'Aditya Ramesh', 'Cameron Raymond', 'Francis Real', 'Kendra Rimbach', 'Carl Ross', 'Bob Rotsted', 'Henri Roussez', 'Nick Ryder', 'Mario Saltarelli', 'Ted Sanders', 'Shibani Santurkar', 'Girish Sastry', 'Heather Schmidt', 'David Schnurr', 'John Schulman', 'Daniel Selsam', 'Kyla Sheppard', 'Toki Sherbakov', 'Jessica Shieh', 'Sarah Shoker', 'Pranav Shyam', 'Szymon Sidor', 'Eric Sigler', 'Maddie Simens', 'Jordan Sitkin', 'Katarina Slama', 'Ian Sohl', 'Benjamin Sokolowsky', 'Yang Song', 'Natalie Staudacher', 'Felipe Petroski Such', 'Natalie Summers', 'Ilya Sutskever', 'Jie Tang', 'Nikolas Tezak', 'Madeleine Thompson', 'Phil Tillet', 'Amin Tootoonchian', 'Elizabeth Tseng', 'Preston Tuggle', 'Nick Turley', 'Jerry Tworek', 'Juan Felipe Cer√≥n Uribe', 'Andrea Vallone', 'Arun Vijayvergiya', 'Chelsea Voss', 'Carroll Wainwright', 'Justin Jay Wang', 'Alvin Wang', 'Ben Wang', 'Jonathan Ward', 'Jason Wei', 'CJ Weinmann', 'Akila Welihinda', 'Peter Welinder', 'Jiayi Weng', 'Lilian Weng', 'Matt Wiethoff', 'Dave Willner', 'Clemens Winter', 'Samuel Wolrich', 'Hannah Wong', 'Lauren Workman', 'Sherwin Wu', 'Jeff Wu', 'Michael Wu', 'Kai Xiao', 'Tao Xu', 'Sarah Yoo', 'Kevin Yu', 'Qiming Yuan', 'Wojciech Zaremba', 'Rowan Zellers', 'Chong Zhang', 'Marvin Zhang', 'Shengjia Zhao', 'Tianhao Zheng', 'Juntang Zhuang', 'William Zhuk', 'Barret Zoph']"	492.0
