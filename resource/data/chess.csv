6	GM Pia Cramling is a Delightful Commentator	Unknown	2024-01-05 18:59:04	https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/18zeil6/gm_pia_cramling_is_a_delightful_commentator/	Over the past few weeks, I've been watching Pia's commentary of her daughter Anna's games in the Rilton ELO tournament ([VODs here](https://www.youtube.com/@AnnaCramlingExtra/videos)). Maybe this is old news, but this was my first time watching, and she's been a *spectacular* host. I don't remember the last time I've been so engaged in a chess tournament, even though I know very little about Anna. Pia is super engaged and excited, seemingly able to talk endlessly for hours on end, all while smiling. Her passion for the game is infectious and makes me want to play! Sure, part of this is probably that she's commentating games for her daughter, but she's clearly also invested for the love of chess. As for her analysis, as (EDIT for clarity: *I* am) someone who's not the greatest player, her commentary feels like the perfect level of depth for me. She doesn't dumb down her analysis - far from it - but she does take the time to explain aspects of a position that might not be so obvious to me. She goes deep into variations while still keeping tabs on overarching strategic ideas, and helps me get into the mindset of the players. Can we get her commentate some other events? I feel like she'd bring a cool perspective to other tournaments!	<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1184c4850>	t3_18zeil6	reddit

21	On the Impact of Information Technologies on Society: an Historical Perspective through the Game of Chess	Frederic Prost	2012-03-15 18:17:04	http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3434v1	The game of chess as always been viewed as an iconic representation of intellectual prowess. Since the very beginning of computer science, the challenge of being able to program a computer capable of playing chess and beating humans has been alive and used both as a mark to measure hardware/software progresses and as an ongoing programming challenge leading to numerous discoveries. In the early days of computer science it was a topic for specialists. But as computers were democratized, and the strength of chess engines began to increase, chess players started to appropriate to themselves these new tools. We show how these interactions between the world of chess and information technologies have been herald of broader social impacts of information technologies. The game of chess, and more broadly the world of chess (chess players, literature, computer softwares and websites dedicated to chess, etc.), turns out to be a surprisingly and particularly sharp indicator of the changes induced in our everyday life by the information technologies. Moreover, in the same way that chess is a modelization of war that captures the raw features of strategic thinking, chess world can be seen as small society making the study of the information technologies impact easier to analyze and to grasp.			arxiv	[]	1.0
22	Automated Chess Commentator Powered by Neural Chess Engine	Hongyu Zang	2019-09-23 15:12:45	http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10413v1	In this paper, we explore a new approach for automated chess commentary generation, which aims to generate chess commentary texts in different categories (e.g., description, comparison, planning, etc.). We introduce a neural chess engine into text generation models to help with encoding boards, predicting moves, and analyzing situations. By jointly training the neural chess engine and the generation models for different categories, the models become more effective. We conduct experiments on 5 categories in a benchmark Chess Commentary dataset and achieve inspiring results in both automatic and human evaluations.			arxiv	['Zhiwei Yu', 'Xiaojun Wan']	2.0
23	Solitaire Chess is NP-complete	Jens Ma√überg	2015-01-26 14:02:29	http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06398v1	"""Solitaire Chess"" is a logic puzzle published by Thinkfun, that can be seen as a single person version of traditional chess. Given a chess board with some chess pieces of the same color placed on it, the task is to capture all pieces but one using only moves that are allowed in chess. Moreover, in each move one piece has to be captured. We prove that deciding if a given instance of Solitaire Chess is solvable is NP-complete."			arxiv	[]	3.0
24	Phoenix-Chess strategy or revisiting the algorithm for playing in Chess with incomplete information	Sergey Ershkov	2021-07-16 10:04:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05204v4	We present here the new insight or revisiting the algorithm for playing in Chess with incomplete information (which can be recognized by its newly short-name as Phoenix-Chess strategy). The only difference with respect to the classical variant of Chess-game is that each rook after its having been captured by enemy chess piece in the proccess of gaming is not to be eliminated from the current game, but this rook is assumed being under virtual repairing during next N-steps (the required number of N is discussed in the current research). Then afterwards, such rook will be introduced in game again during maximal N-steps if only the chessboard square (on which it was captured previously) has not been occupied at previous step. In this case, Phoenix-Chess can be classified as game without predictable horizon of planning, so this kind of game should be considered as Chess-like games with incomplete information.			arxiv	['Millana Ershkova']	4.0

26	SentiMATE: Learning to play Chess through Natural Language Processing	Isaac Kamlish	2019-07-18 23:48:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08321v3	"We present SentiMATE, a novel end-to-end Deep Learning model for Chess, employing Natural Language Processing that aims to learn an effective evaluation function assessing move quality. This function is pre-trained on the sentiment of commentary associated with the training moves and is used to guide and optimize the agent's game-playing decision making. The contributions of this research are three-fold: we build and put forward both a classifier which extracts commentary describing the quality of Chess moves in vast commentary datasets, and a Sentiment Analysis model trained on Chess commentary to accurately predict the quality of said moves, to then use those predictions to evaluate the optimal next move of a Chess agent. Both classifiers achieve over 90 % classification accuracy. Lastly, we present a Chess engine, SentiMATE, which evaluates Chess moves based on a pre-trained sentiment evaluation function. Our results exhibit strong evidence to support our initial hypothesis - ""Can Natural Language Processing be used to train a novel and sample efficient evaluation function in Chess Engines?"" - as we integrate our evaluation function into modern Chess engines and play against agents with traditional Chess move evaluation functions, beating both random agents and a DeepChess implementation at a level-one search depth - representing the number of moves a traditional Chess agent (employing the alpha-beta search algorithm) looks ahead in order to evaluate a given chess state."			arxiv	['Isaac Bentata Chocron', 'Nicholas McCarthy']	6.0

28	Large-scale Analysis of Chess Games with Chess Engines: A Preliminary Report	Mathieu Acher	2016-04-28 08:37:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04186v1	The strength of chess engines together with the availability of numerous chess games have attracted the attention of chess players, data scientists, and researchers during the last decades. State-of-the-art engines now provide an authoritative judgement that can be used in many applications like cheating detection, intrinsic ratings computation, skill assessment, or the study of human decision-making. A key issue for the research community is to gather a large dataset of chess games together with the judgement of chess engines. Unfortunately the analysis of each move takes lots of times. In this paper, we report our effort to analyse almost 5 millions chess games with a computing grid. During summer 2015, we processed 270 millions unique played positions using the Stockfish engine with a quite high depth (20). We populated a database of 1+ tera-octets of chess evaluations, representing an estimated time of 50 years of computation on a single machine. Our effort is a first step towards the replication of research results, the supply of open data and procedures for exploring new directions, and the investigation of software engineering/scalability issues when computing billions of moves.			arxiv	['Fran√ßois Esnault']	8.0
29	Augmented Reality Chess Analyzer (ARChessAnalyzer): In-Device Inference of Physical Chess Game Positions through Board Segmentation and Piece Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network	Anav Mehta	2020-08-18 20:05:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01649v1	Chess game position analysis is important in improving ones game. It requires entry of moves into a chess engine which is, cumbersome and error prone. We present ARChessAnalyzer, a complete pipeline from live image capture of a physical chess game, to board and piece recognition, to move analysis and finally to Augmented Reality (AR) overlay of the chess diagram position and move on the physical board. ARChessAnalyzer is like a scene analyzer - it uses an ensemble of traditional image and vision techniques to segment the scene (ie the chess game) and uses Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict the segmented pieces and combine it together to analyze the game. This paper advances the state of the art in the first of its kind end to end integration of robust detection and segmentation of the board, chess piece detection using the fine-tuned AlexNet CNN and chess engine analyzer in a handheld device app. The accuracy of the entire chess position prediction pipeline is 93.45\% and takes 3-4.5sec from live capture to AR overlay. We also validated our hypothesis that ARChessAnalyzer, is faster at analysis than manual entry for all board positions for valid outcomes. Our hope is that the instantaneous feedback this app provides will help chess learners worldwide at all levels improve their game.			arxiv	[]	9.0
30	Learning to Play Chess from Textbooks (LEAP): a Corpus for Evaluating Chess Moves based on Sentiment Analysis	Haifa Alrdahi	2023-10-31 08:26:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20260v1	Learning chess strategies has been investigated widely, with most studies focussing on learning from previous games using search algorithms. Chess textbooks encapsulate grandmaster knowledge, explain playing strategies and require a smaller search space compared to traditional chess agents. This paper examines chess textbooks as a new knowledge source for enabling machines to learn how to play chess -- a resource that has not been explored previously. We developed the LEAP corpus, a first and new heterogeneous dataset with structured (chess move notations and board states) and unstructured data (textual descriptions) collected from a chess textbook containing 1164 sentences discussing strategic moves from 91 games. We firstly labelled the sentences based on their relevance, i.e., whether they are discussing a move. Each relevant sentence was then labelled according to its sentiment towards the described move. We performed empirical experiments that assess the performance of various transformer-based baseline models for sentiment analysis. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of employing transformer-based sentiment analysis models for evaluating chess moves, with the best performing model obtaining a weighted micro F_1 score of 68%. Finally, we synthesised the LEAP corpus to create a larger dataset, which can be used as a solution to the limited textual resource in the chess domain.			arxiv	['Riza Batista-Navarro']	10.0
31	Transfinite game values in infinite chess	C. D. A. Evans	2013-02-18 18:14:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4377v2	We investigate the transfinite game values arising in infinite chess, providing both upper and lower bounds on the supremum of these values---the omega one of chess---with two senses depending on whether one considers only finite positions or also positions with infinitely many pieces. For lower bounds, we present specific infinite positions with transfinite game values of omega, omega^2, omega^2 times k, and omega^3. By embedding trees into chess, we show that there is a computable infinite chess position that is a win for white if the players are required to play according to a deterministic computable strategy, but which is a draw without that restriction. Finally, we prove that every countable ordinal arises as the game value of a position in infinite three-dimensional chess, and consequently the omega one of infinite three-dimensional chess is as large as it can be, namely, true omega one.			arxiv	['Joel David Hamkins']	12.0
32	Quantifying the complexity and similarity of chess openings using online chess community data	Giordano De Marzo	2022-06-28 22:43:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14312v2	"Hundreds of years after its creation, the game of chess is still widely played worldwide. Opening Theory is one of the pillars of chess and requires years of study to be mastered. Here we exploit the ""wisdom of the crowd"" in an online chess platform to answer questions that, traditionally, only chess experts could tackle. We first define the relatedness network of chess openings that quantifies how similar two openings are to play. In this network, we spot communities of nodes corresponding to the most common opening choices and their mutual relationships, information which is hard to obtain from the existing classification of openings. Moreover, we use the relatedness network to forecast the future openings players will start to play and we back-test these predictions, obtaining performances considerably higher than those of a random predictor. Finally, we use the Economic Fitness and Complexity algorithm to measure how difficult to play openings are and how skilled in openings players are.

Chaves	1998-08-21 19:13:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9808001v1	It is odd that chess grandmasters often disagree in their analysis of positions, sometimes even of simple ones, and that a grandmaster can hold his own against an powerful analytic machine such as Deep Blue. The fact that there must exist pure winning strategies for chess is used to construct a control strategy function. It is then shown that chess strategy is equivalent to an autonomous system of differential equations, and conjectured that the system is chaotic. If true the conjecture would explain the forenamed peculiarities and would also imply that there cannot exist a static evaluator for chess.			arxiv	[]	14.0

35	ChESS - Quick and Robust Detection of Chess-board Features	Stuart Bennett	2013-01-23 13:10:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.5491v1	Localization of chess-board vertices is a common task in computer vision, underpinning many applications, but relatively little work focusses on designing a specific feature detector that is fast, accurate and robust. In this paper the `Chess-board Extraction by Subtraction and Summation' (ChESS) feature detector, designed to exclusively respond to chess-board vertices, is presented. The method proposed is robust against noise, poor lighting and poor contrast, requires no prior knowledge of the extent of the chess-board pattern, is computationally very efficient, and provides a strength measure of detected features. Such a detector has significant application both in the key field of camera calibration, as well as in Structured Light 3D reconstruction. Evidence is presented showing its robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in comparison to other commonly used detectors both under simulation and in experimental 3D reconstruction of flat plate and cylindrical objects			arxiv	['Joan Lasenby']	16.0
36	Innovation and Nested Preferential Growth in Chess Playing Behavior	Juan I. Perotti	2013-09-02 09:29:31	http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0336v2	Complexity develops via the incorporation of innovative properties. Chess is one of the most complex strategy games, where expert contenders exercise decision making by imitating old games or introducing innovations. In this work, we study innovation in chess by analyzing how different move sequences are played at the population level. It is found that the probability of exploring a new or innovative move decreases as a power law with the frequency of the preceding move sequence. Chess players also exploit already known move sequences according to their frequencies, following a preferential growth mechanism. Furthermore, innovation in chess exhibits Heaps' law suggesting similarities with the process of vocabulary growth. We propose a robust generative mechanism based on nested Yule-Simon preferential growth processes that reproduces the empirical observations. These results, supporting the self-similar nature of innovations in chess are important in the context of decision making in a competitive scenario, and extend the scope of relevant findings recently discovered regarding the emergence of Zipf's law in chess.			arxiv	['Hang-Hyun Jo', 'Ana L.

37	DeepChess: End-to-End Deep Neural Network for Automatic Learning in Chess	Eli David	2017-11-27 13:04:57	http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09667v1	We present an end-to-end learning method for chess, relying on deep neural networks. Without any a priori knowledge, in particular without any knowledge regarding the rules of chess, a deep neural network is trained using a combination of unsupervised pretraining and supervised training. The unsupervised training extracts high level features from a given position, and the supervised training learns to compare two chess positions and select the more favorable one. The training relies entirely on datasets of several million chess games, and no further domain specific knowledge is incorporated. The experiments show that the resulting neural network (referred to as DeepChess) is on a par with state-of-the-art chess playing programs, which have been developed through many years of manual feature selection and tuning. DeepChess is the first end-to-end machine learning-based method that results in a grandmaster-level chess playing performance.			arxiv	['Nathan S. Netanyahu', 'Lior Wolf']	18.0
38	Information based explanation methods for deep learning agents -- with applications on large open-source chess models	Patrik Hammersborg	2023-09-18 12:08:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09702v1	With large chess-playing neural network models like AlphaZero contesting the state of the art within the world of computerised chess, two challenges present themselves: The question of how to explain the domain knowledge internalised by such models, and the problem that such models are not made openly available. This work presents the re-implementation of the concept detection methodology applied to AlphaZero in McGrath et al. (2022), by using large, open-source chess models with comparable performance. We obtain results similar to those achieved on AlphaZero, while relying solely on open-source resources. We also present a novel explainable AI (XAI) method, which is guaranteed to highlight exhaustively and exclusively the information used by the explained model. This method generates visual explanations tailored to domains characterised by discrete input spaces, as is the case for chess. Our presented method has the desirable property of controlling the information flow between any input vector and the given model, which in turn provides strict guarantees regarding what information is used by the trained model during inference. We demonstrate the viability of our method by applying it to standard 8x8 chess, using large open-source chess models.			arxiv	['Inga Str√ºmke']	19.0
39	End-to-End Chess Recognition	Athanasios Masouris	2023-10-06 08:30:20	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04086v3	Chess recognition is the task of extracting the chess piece configuration from a chessboard image. Current approaches use a pipeline of separate, independent, modules such as chessboard detection, square localization, and piece classification. Instead, we follow the deep learning philosophy and explore an end-to-end approach to directly predict the configuration from the image, thus avoiding the error accumulation of the sequential approaches and eliminating the need for intermediate annotations. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset, Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), that consists of 10,800 real photographs and their corresponding annotations. In contrast to existing datasets that are synthetically rendered and have only limited angles, ChessReD has photographs captured from various angles using smartphone cameras; a sensor choice made to ensure real-world applicability. Our approach in chess recognition on the introduced challenging benchmark dataset outperforms related approaches, successfully recognizing the chess pieces' configuration in 15.26% of ChessReD's test images. This accuracy may seem low, but it is ~7x better than the current state-of-the-art and reflects the difficulty of the problem.

44	How would you rank the most prestigious chess tournaments?

My personal (super subjective) top ten list would go something like: 1.) The World Chess Championship (cuz like 95% of the time it's a contest between the strongest and second strongest player in the world) 2.) The Candidates Tournament (second to the World Championship because it's the only tournament where the world champion isn't allowed to play, but most of the strongest players in the world are) 3.) The FIDE World Cup (path to most candidates events) 4.) The Grand Swiss (same as the CWC, path to most candidates events) 5.) The Grand Prix (feels like a less flashy version of the two tournaments above) 6.) Wijk aan Zee (I place it this high because of the historical context... literally every world champion since Botvinnik has participated in at least one Wijk aan Zee before (except the elusive Bobby Fischer), and, as Bent Larsen himself said, ""Normal people have to see Naples before they die... but a chess grandmaster has to win Wijk aan Zee first."") 7.) Fischer Random World Championship (here I'm just repping Fischer and Carlsen's takes of enjoying intuitive chess over prep and engine memorization) 8.) The Chess Olympiad (it's a team tournament so kinda hard to fit it in here, but I think #8 is its rightful spot) 9.) The Sinquefield Cup (they have often had incredibly strong tournaments, sometimes with all the top players attending, starting from #1) 10.) World Rapid/Blitz Championships (the funnest ones to watch, but not necessarily the most prestigious/coveted... still pretty important tho) Honourable mentions would be the GCT (multiple tournaments), Tal Memorial, Capablanca Memorial, SCC (held by [chess.com](https://chess.com)) and Norway Chess.

51	Assessing Game Balance with AlphaZero: Exploring Alternative Rule Sets in Chess	Nenad Toma≈°ev	2020-09-09 15:49:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04374v2	It is non-trivial to design engaging and balanced sets of game rules. Modern chess has evolved over centuries, but without a similar recourse to history, the consequences of rule changes to game dynamics are difficult to predict. AlphaZero provides an alternative in silico means of game balance assessment. It is a system that can learn near-optimal strategies for any rule set from scratch, without any human supervision, by continually learning from its own experience. In this study we use AlphaZero to creatively explore and design new chess variants. There is growing interest in chess variants like Fischer Random Chess, because of classical chess's voluminous opening theory, the high percentage of draws in professional play, and the non-negligible number of games that end while both players are still in their home preparation. We compare nine other variants that involve atomic changes to the rules of chess. The changes allow for novel strategic and tactical patterns to emerge, while keeping the games close to the original. By learning near-optimal strategies for each variant with AlphaZero, we determine what games between strong human players might look like if these variants were adopted. Qualitatively, several variants are very dynamic. An analytic comparison show that pieces are valued differently between variants, and that some variants are more decisive than classical chess. Our findings demonstrate the rich possibilities that lie beyond the rules of modern chess.			arxiv	['Ulrich Paquet', 'Demis Hassabis', 'Vladimir Kramnik']	21.0

Generalizing a known result on so-called Richman games, we show that for a natural class of games including bidding chess, each position can be assigned rational upper and lower values corresponding to the limit proportion of money that Black (say) needs in order to force a win and to avoid losing, respectively. We have computed these values for all three-piece endgames, and in all cases, the upper and lower values coincide. Already with three pieces, the game is quite complex, and the values have denominators of up to 138 digits.			arxiv	['Johan W√§stlund']	30.0
