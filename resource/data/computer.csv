1	Boyfriend has a ghost monitor	Unknown	2024-01-06 18:23:02	https://www.reddit.com/r/computer/comments/1906c40/boyfriend_has_a_ghost_monitor/	"We looked up a bunch of tutorials, deleted the monitors or pnp monitors, reinstalling the NVIDIA drivers, etc, nothing worked. He still had the ghost monitor. He only owns one monitor. Not sure what causes this issue, it happened out of nowhere one day. For now, we only have everything set to ""Display 2"", his real monitor. How do we get rid of the ghost monitor? Now it's causing games to appear on the ""ghost"" monitor like League of Legends, which doesn't have an option to select what monitor it opens on. Windows + Shift + Arrow doesn't work either. It happens with all of his games, needing OBS to even see what he's doing and it doesn't work for all games."	1.0	t3_1906c40	reddit

3	No more sound and dark screen in BIOS after installing new SSD	Unknown	2024-01-06 17:51:35	https://www.reddit.com/r/computer/comments/1905l9i/no_more_sound_and_dark_screen_in_bios_after/	I had two SSDs, one with Windows 10 installed and working fine, and another faulty SSD that I discarded. I installed the new SSD. Since that time, I have no sound in Windows and when going to BIOS I see nothing about sound and my scren in BIOS is really dark. I downloaded new audio drivers, but installing them does nothing, as Windows does not even detect sound in device manager. It's like I have no sound anymore. Audio was working fine before I installed the new SSD and I didn't touchthe old working SSD. It's on a laptop so is it possible I messed with something when I opened the laptop to install the new SSD and if so what can be done to correct the problem? BTW I tried to install Linux on the new SSD and screen is really dark too on live USB. Thanks	1.0	t3_1905l9i	reddit

TLDR: I don’t have physical or monetary access to pro laptop repair. So I replaced the fans in my Rog zephyrus GX502L got it to boot with all parts functioning, suddenly it shut off and I cannot get it to boot now. For context, I am in a remote town and have no easy or cheap access to a pc repair shop, I would have gone if I could. Recently the fans stopped working on my (out of warranty, refurbished) Asus Rog zephyrus. They were loud and not spinning properly. I did everything I could before finally deciding to order some new parts and do it myself. I did my research and took all precautions about static and the like. I after a while the new parts arrived and I managed to get them installed after a few hiccups. This is when I managed to get the laptop to start normally, the new fans spun and I reached the desktop. However as I went to check I hadn’t knocked the cpu out or something it suddenly shut off. Being at the end of a long day I decided to leave it till the next evening. Unfortunately, now only the keyboard and the “on light” flash before it stops. That only occurs after I do the whole “unplug the battery, button for 60 seconds” thing. I am new to this and very lost, in my home town I just went to the pc shop but I don’t have that option. So any advice is appreciated, even if it is “give up”.	1.0	t3_18zlt9x	reddit

I'll soon start my computer engineering university program, and I'm torn between purchasing a **14"" MacBook Pro with M1 chip or a 15"" MacBook Air with M2 chip.** My needs will involve programming, web browsing, video streaming, and the creation of some 3D models for 3D printing. What leads me to prefer the **MacBook Pro with M3** is the superior display (120Hz vs 60Hz), longer battery life, more available ports, and undoubtedly better performance. On the other hand, the **MacBook Air** would be more convenient for its lower price, and I am concerned that the Pro model may not be truly necessary for my needs. I don't deny, though, that the idea of having a MacBook Pro is very appealing to me, and at the moment, I am inclined to choose that one cause i just discovered that their weight is almost the same. However, I would like to hear your thoughts and discuss it below. ***Thanks to anyone who will help me <3***"	3.0	t3_18zha17	reddit

I have an Intel Optane H10 32gb with 512gb QLC SSD and I was eyeing the Samsung 970 Evo Plus 2tb as my main new SSD drive. Although, **I dunno if it would be the right choice for my needs so I'm here to ask you some opinions on the matter**. I know that, thanks to 3D XPoint memory technology, Intel Optane should be faster in boot up, random file access and light work than any other SSD while being actually worse with heavier and more sustained workloads, due to the limited cache and the slow QLC SSD that it's paired with. I often use Lightoom/Photoshop/DaVinci/Illustrator for some projects and sometimes I also game a little bit. **Will 970 Evo Plus make a positive difference on those scenarios or not?** Will I also gonna feel my pc as less responsive during light work like browsing and office work, as well as experiencing a slower boot up time (currently I have 1.8 second BIOS boot up time shown on task manager)?

Would I have to delete the partition on the D: drive, and if so how would I go about doing that? Appreciate the help!

The problem seems to occur randomly, making it challenging to pinpoint the root cause. There are times when my PC works flawlessly, and then there are instances where I'm plagued by frequent blue screens, rendering my system unusable. Recently, the situation has worsened to the point where every time I start my PC, I'm greeted by a blue screen notifying me that the system didn't start correctly, prompting me to either restart or explore other options. In my quest to resolve these issues, I've done my fair share of research, delving into tutorials and scouring various websites for potential solutions. I've even reached out to the person who built the PC for me, but unfortunately, none of the suggestions or advice provided have made a significant impact or revealed the underlying cause. I'm reaching out to this community in the hopes that some experienced individuals might shed some light on this matter. Has anyone faced a similar situation, and if so, how did you go about resolving it? I'm open to any guidance, suggestions, or troubleshooting steps that could help me get to the bottom of this persistent blue screen problem. Thank you in advance for your assistance!	1.0	t3_18ytf0a	reddit

I've wiped drives, fac reset windows, updated chipset drivers, deleted drivers reinstalled new ones, messed with all kinds of vsync settings, Reapplied thermal paste, added 2 new fans to the computer, the whole 9 miles of basically everything people mentioned on here and other places. Nothing has worked. Its more so annoying at this point as I wanna get this issue solved before I head back to college.

I thought It was Thermal Throttling at first but after trying some repairs it didnt do the trick. I should also mention I cannot undervolt or underclock my CPU/GPU because of my motherboard and CPU. I'm desperate for a fix at this point and do not wanna replace the computer as all of these are fairly new parts. Any advice on what it could be is much appreciated and I can answer any questions in the comments. Ill post a video again for reference on what my PC does while gaming aka the ""Microstutter"".

So I replaced the memory in one of my laptops and wasn't really paying attention as I was setting everything up and apparently I deleted something I wasn't supposed to. So now when I try to start it up to load an operating system it shows that one of the partitions has been deleted, if I try to refresh it shows that the drive is locked. I got my other laptop up and running just fine so I'm curious if I can just pull that nvme out, put it in the housing and then plug it into my other laptop and just reinitialize it. I've tried a few different fixes I found online but most of them are referring to a situation where your computer still boots up properly and then shows an issue. Mine boots up and then shows a light blue screen, not the blue screen of death, the windows blue error screen and then you hit escape and you can go to the boot menu, bios settings, system tests, all of that fun stuff, but I can't get past that point.	1.0	t3_18yj54v	reddit

When I went into the user folder directory the data remained despite me deleting it, as the user doesn’t exist anymore. I attempted to delete it and it gave me an error saying *assortment of numbers* needed to give you permission. Anyway I tried using mcafee shred feature and it worked in removing MOST of it but some still remain, with the same error. I did something stupid, and went into the properties menu and noticed two selections listed, one of which was the same assortment of numbers + account unknown the error had and I removed it from the properties list. I got a windows security warning saying I should reverse the action but I didn’t even realize exactly what I did, so I haven’t reversed it. Still can’t remove the user folder, for whats left of it. Currently in the properties menu it has; my main account, SYSTEM, system administrator, and another account unknown and an assortment of numbers, similar to the one I had initially removed. What I’m asking is what can I do to remove this user folder, I wanted to remove it initially because I was afraid there could be malware on it. I never downloaded anything sketchy but I visited a few websites and I had not gone into this in several weeks, but prior my computer would take a year to shut off after pressing shutdown and I think it only does this when I logged into that user. And as far as that goes, would I be better off doing a factory reset given that I messed with properties and stuff? I’m a bit afraid to do one because my computer came with nvidia graphics drivers and stuff(not preloaded though!) and I don’t know how to get them back after a factory reset. and for anything potentially complex relating to computer files and stuff PLEASE explain it to me like I’m a baby cause I don’t understand computer stuff much.

104	A Survey of Current Trends in Distributed, Grid and Cloud Computing	Gaurav Mittal	2013-08-08 10:23:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1806v1	Through the 1990s to 2012 the internet changed the world of computing drastically. It started its journey with parallel computing after it advanced to distributed computing and further to grid computing. And in present scenario it creates a new world which is pronounced as a Cloud Computing [1]. These all three terms have different meanings. Cloud computing is based on backward computing schemes like cluster computing, distributed computing, grid computing and utility computing. The basic concept of cloud computing is virtualization. It provides virtual hardware and software resources to various requesting programs. This paper gives a detailed description about cluster computing, grid computing and cloud computing and gives an insight of some implementations of the same. We try to list the inspirations for the advent of all these technologies. We also account for some present scenario faults of grid computing and also discuss new cloud computing projects which are being managed by the Government of India for learning. The paper also reviews the existing work and covers (analytically), to some extent, some innovative ideas that can be implemented.			arxiv	['Dr. Nishtha Kesswani', 'Kuldeep Goswami']	4.0
105	Analysis on Computation-Intensive Status Update in Mobile Edge Computing	Qiaobin Kuang	2020-02-15 15:45:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06400v1	In status update scenarios, the freshness of information is measured in terms of age-of-information (AoI), which essentially reflects the timeliness for real-time applications to transmit status update messages to a remote controller. For some applications, computational expensive and time consuming data processing is inevitable for status information of messages to be displayed. Mobile edge servers are equipped with adequate computation resources and they are placed close to users. Thus, mobile edge computing (MEC) can be a promising technology to reduce AoI for computation-intensive messages. In this paper, we study the AoI for computation-intensive messages with MEC, and consider three computing schemes: local computing, remote computing at the MEC server, and partial computing, i.e., some part of computing tasks are performed locally, and the rest is executed at the MEC server. Zero-wait policy is adopted in all three schemes. Specifically, in local computing, a new message is generated immediately after the previous one is revealed by computing. While in remote computing and partial computing, a new message is generated once the previous one is received by the remote MEC server. With infinite queue size and exponentially distributed transmission time, closed-form average AoI for exponentially distributed computing time is derived for the three computing schemes. For deterministic computing time, the average AoI is analyzed numerically. Simulation results show that by carefully partitioning the computing tasks, the average AoI in partial computing is the smallest compared to local computing and remote computing. The results also indicate numerically the conditions on which remote computing attains smaller average AoI compared with local computing.			arxiv	['Jie Gong', 'Xiang Chen', 'Xiao Ma']	5.0
106	Computable structures on topological manifolds	Marcelo A. Aguilar	2017-03-12 06:14:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04075v2	We propose a definition of computable manifold by introducing computability as a structure that we impose to a given topological manifold, just in the same way as differentiability or piecewise linearity are defined for smooth and PL manifolds respectively. Using the framework of computable topology and Type-2 theory of effectivity, we develop computable versions of all the basic concepts needed to define manifolds, like computable atlases and (computably) compatible computable atlases. We prove that given a computable atlas $\Phi$ defined on a set $M$, we can construct a computable topological space $(M, \tau_\Phi, \beta_\Phi, \nu_\Phi)$, where $\tau_\Phi$ is the topology on $M$ induced by $\Phi$ and that the equivalence class of this computable space characterizes the computable structure determined by $\Phi$. The concept of computable submanifold is also investigated. We show that any compact computable manifold which satisfies a computable version of the $T_2$-separation axiom, can be embedded as a computable submanifold of some euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{q}$, with a computable embedding, where $\mathbb{R}^{q}$ is equipped with its usual topology and some canonical computable encoding of all open rational balls.			arxiv	['Rodolfo Conde']	6.0

109	Turing machines can be efficiently simulated by the General Purpose Analog Computer	Amaury Pouly	2012-03-21 07:48:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4667v2	The Church-Turing thesis states that any sufficiently powerful computational model which captures the notion of algorithm is computationally equivalent to the Turing machine. This equivalence usually holds both at a computability level and at a computational complexity level modulo polynomial reductions. However, the situation is less clear in what concerns models of computation using real numbers, and no analog of the Church-Turing thesis exists for this case. Recently it was shown that some models of computation with real numbers were equivalent from a computability perspective. In particular it was shown that Shannon's General Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC) is equivalent to Computable Analysis. However, little is known about what happens at a computational complexity level. In this paper we shed some light on the connections between this two models, from a computational complexity level, by showing that, modulo polynomial reductions, computations of Turing machines can be simulated by GPACs, without the need of using more (space) resources than those used in the original Turing computation, as long as we are talking about bounded computations. In other words, computations done by the GPAC are as space-efficient as computations done in the context of Computable Analysis.			arxiv	['Olivier Bournez', 'Daniel S. Graça']	9.0

Future progress of new computational devices capable of dealing with problems of big data, internet of things, semantic web, cognitive robotics and neuroinformatics depends on the adequate models of computation. In this article we first present the current state of the art through systematization of existing models and mechanisms, and outline basic structural framework of computation. We argue that defining computation as information processing, and given that there is no information without (physical) representation, the dynamics of information on the fundamental level is physical/ intrinsic/ natural computation. As a special case, intrinsic computation is used for designed computation in computing machinery. Intrinsic natural computation occurs on variety of levels of physical processes, containing the levels of computation of living organisms (including highly intelligent animals) as well as designed computational devices. The present article offers a typology of current models of computation and indicates future paths for the advancement of the field; both by the development of new computational models and by learning from nature how to better compute using different mechanisms of intrinsic computation.			arxiv	['Gordana Dodig-Crnkovic']	10.0

The traditional network architecture cannot efficiently leverage these distributed computing power resources due to computing power island effect. To overcome these problems and improve network efficiency, a new network computing paradigm is proposed, i.e., Computing Power Network (CPN). Computing power network can connect ubiquitous and heterogenous computing power resources through networking to realize computing power scheduling flexibly. In this survey, we make an exhaustive review on the state-of-the-art research efforts on computing power network. We first give an overview of computing power network, including definition, architecture, and advantages. Next, a comprehensive elaboration of issues on computing power modeling, information awareness and announcement, resource allocation, network forwarding, computing power transaction platform and resource orchestration platform is presented. The computing power network testbed is built and evaluated. The applications and use cases in computing power network are discussed. Then, the key enabling technologies for computing power network are introduced. Finally, open challenges and future research directions are presented as well.			arxiv	['Bo Lei', 'Junlin Liu', 'Haonan Huang', 'Xing Zhang', 'Jing Peng', 'Wenbo Wang']	11.0
112	Duality and Recycling Computing in Quantum Computers	Gui Lu Long	2007-08-15 03:17:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1986v1	Quantum computer possesses quantum parallelism and offers great computing power over classical computer \cite{er1,er2}. As is well-know, a moving quantum object passing through a double-slit exhibits particle wave duality. A quantum computer is static and lacks this duality property. The recently proposed duality computer has exploited this particle wave duality property, and it may offer additional computing power \cite{r1}. Simply put it, a duality computer is a moving quantum computer passing through a double-slit. A duality computer offers the capability to perform separate operations on the sub-waves coming out of the different slits, in the so-called duality parallelism. Here we show that an $n$-dubit duality computer can be modeled by an $(n+1)$-qubit quantum computer. In a duality mode, computing operations are not necessarily unitary. A $n$-qubit quantum computer can be used as an $n$-bit reversible classical computer and is energy efficient. Our result further enables a $(n+1)$-qubit quantum computer to run classical algorithms in a $O(2^n)$-bit classical computer. The duality mode provides a natural link between classical computing and quantum computing. Here we also propose a recycling computing mode in which a quantum computer will continue to compute until the result is obtained. These two modes provide new tool for algorithm design. A search algorithm for the unsorted database search problem is designed.			arxiv	['Yang Liu']	12.0

116	Finite Computational Structures and Implementations	Attila Egri-Nagy	2016-10-19 02:25:50	http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05849v1	What is computable with limited resources? How can we verify the correctness of computations? How to measure computational power with precision? Despite the immense scientific and engineering progress in computing, we still have only partial answers to these questions. In order to make these problems more precise, we describe an abstract algebraic definition of classical computation, generalizing traditional models to semigroups. The mathematical abstraction also allows the investigation of different computing paradigms (e.g. cellular automata, reversible computing) in the same framework. Here we summarize the main questions and recent results of the research of finite computation.			arxiv	[]	16.0

It unifies computational science (scientific computing) with intelligent extended reality and spatial computing for the medical field. It significantly extends previous Clinical XR, by integrating computational methods from neural simulation to computational geometry, computational vision and computer graphics up to theoretical computer science to solve hard problems in medicine and neuroscience: from low-code/no-code authoring medical XR platforms to deep learning systems for diagnostics, therapeutics, rehabilitation and from surgical planning to real-time operative navigation in XR.			arxiv	[]	17.0
118	Marvel DC: A Blockchain-Based Decentralized and Incentive-Compatible Distributed Computing Protocol	Conor McMenamin	2022-07-28 11:11:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14011v1	Decentralized computation outsourcing should allow anyone to access the large amounts of computational power that exists in the Internet of Things. Unfortunately, when trusted third parties are removed to achieve this decentralization, ensuring an outsourced computation is performed correctly remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we provide a solution to this problem. We outline Marvel DC, a fully decentralized blockchain-based distributed-computing protocol which formally guarantees that computers are strictly incentivized to correctly perform requested computations. Furthermore, Marvel DC utilizes a reputation management protocol to ensure that, for any minority of computers not performing calculations correctly, these computers are identified and selected for computations with diminishing probability. We then outline Privacy Marvel DC, a privacy-enhanced version of Marvel DC which decouples results from the computers which computed them, making the protocol suitable for computations such as Federated Learning, where results can reveal sensitive information about that computer that computed them. We provide an implementation of Marvel DC and analyses of both protocols, demonstrating that they are not only the first protocols to provide the aforementioned formal guarantees, but are also practical, competitive with prior attempts in the field, and ready to deploy.			arxiv	['Vanesa Daza']	18.0
119	Computing Offloading and Semantic Compression for Intelligent Computing Tasks in MEC Systems	Yuanpeng Zheng	2023-07-06 03:15:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02747v1	This paper investigates the intelligent computing task-oriented computing offloading and semantic compression in mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. With the popularity of intelligent applications in various industries, terminals increasingly need to offload intelligent computing tasks with complex demands to MEC servers for computing, which is a great challenge for bandwidth and computing capacity allocation in MEC systems. Considering the accuracy requirement of intelligent computing tasks, we formulate an optimization problem of computing offloading and semantic compression. We jointly optimize the system utility which are represented as computing accuracy and task delay respectively to acquire the optimized system utility. To solve the proposed optimization problem, we decompose it into computing capacity allocation subproblem and compression offloading subproblem and obtain solutions through convex optimization and successive convex approximation. After that, the offloading decisions, computing capacity and compressed ratio are obtained in closed forms. We design the computing offloading and semantic compression algorithm for intelligent computing tasks in MEC systems then. Simulation results represent that our algorithm converges quickly and acquires better performance and resource utilization efficiency through the trend with total number of users and computing capacity compared with benchmarks.			arxiv	['Tiankui Zhang', 'Rong Huang', 'Yapeng Wang']	19.0

Quantum oracles may transmit phase information which is available to a quantum computer but not a classical computer. One consequence of this observation is that there is an oracle which is of no assistance to a classical computer but which allows a quantum computer to solve undecidable problems. Thus useful relativized separations between quantum and classical complexity classes must exclude the transmission of phase information from oracle to computer.			arxiv	[]	21.0

The first party's computational capabilities can be extremely limited: she must only be able to create and measure single-qubit superposition states. The second party is not required to use measurement-based quantum computation. The protocol requires the (optimal) exchange of O(J log(N)) single-qubit states, where J is the computational depth and N is the number of qubits needed for the computation.			arxiv	['Lorenzo Maccone', 'Tomoyuki Morimae', 'Terry G.

However, in some cases, if S has certain topological properties, we can conclude that S is computable. It is known that if a semi-computable set S is a compact manifold with boundary, then the computability of \deltaS implies the computability of S. In this paper we examine the case when S is a 1-manifold with boundary, not necessarily compact. We show that a similar result holds in this case under assumption that S has finitely many components.			arxiv	['Zvonko Iljazovic']	30.0

However, there is much that can be learned from traditional classical computer engineering. In this paper, we describe the Parallel Research Kernels (PRK), a tool that was very useful for designing classical parallel computing systems. The PRK are simple kernels written to expose bottlenecks that limit classical parallel computing performance. We hypothesize that an analogous tool for quantum computing, Quantum Research Kernels (QRK), may similarly aid the co-design of software and hardware for quantum computing systems, and we give a few examples of representative QRKs.			arxiv	['Timothy G.

138	A Galois connection between Turing jumps and limits	Vasco Brattka	2018-02-05 11:27:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01355v3	Limit computable functions can be characterized by Turing jumps on the input side or limits on the output side. As a monad of this pair of adjoint operations we obtain a problem that characterizes the low functions and dually to this another problem that characterizes the functions that are computable relative to the halting problem. Correspondingly, these two classes are the largest classes of functions that can be pre or post composed to limit computable functions without leaving the class of limit computable functions. We transfer these observations to the lattice of represented spaces where it leads to a formal Galois connection. We also formulate a version of this result for computable metric spaces. Limit computability and computability relative to the halting problem are notions that coincide for points and sequences, but even restricted to continuous functions the former class is strictly larger than the latter. On computable metric spaces we can characterize the functions that are computable relative to the halting problem as those functions that are limit computable with a modulus of continuity that is computable relative to the halting problem. As a consequence of this result we obtain, for instance, that Lipschitz continuous functions that are limit computable are automatically computable relative to the halting problem. We also discuss 1-generic points as the canonical points of continuity of limit computable functions, and we prove that restricted to these points limit computable functions are computable relative to the halting problem. Finally, we demonstrate how these results can be applied in computable analysis.			arxiv	[]	38.0

There is a great deal of hype in this technology based area for that reason it is getting a great deal of attention of the computing community. Grid Computing makes use of clusters of PCs (personal computers), network servers or other computing technology-based systems. These systems are connecting jointly to deal with complex calculations, communication and collaboration. Grid Computing offers a great deal of support for offering corporations to make use of their idle computing power, or systems processing cycles, to produce a type of supercomputer arrangement. The technology of grid computing has newly transferred from customary high performance plus distributed technology based computing systems to utility and pervasive based computing arrangements. These technology-based structures are having superior potentials of the wireless networks communication and collaboration as well as having thin, lightweight and remotely accessible devices. This has as produced the establishment new computing technology paradigm known as Mobile Grid Computing. This research is going to assess and analyze the grid computing and mobile computing technology based arrangements. Here I will assess the feasibility analysis of the mobile grid computing. This research will analyze the mapping of grid computing techniques on the mobile domain. In this scenario, I will assess how can, we achieve grid architecture in mobile devices. For the sake of implementing a mobile gird arrangement, I will analyze the existing grid computing models and discuss the design, implementation, architecture and its limitations. This research will also highlight the effect of grid computing on mobiles load balancing, high processing efficiency and less network communication.			arxiv	[]	39.0

To overcome the limitations that restrict such applications, the development of a comprehensive computing paradigm has garnered attention in both academia and industry. However, a gap exists in the literature owing to the scarce research, and a comprehensive computing paradigm is yet to be systematically designed and reviewed. This study introduces a novel concept, called aerial computing, via the amalgamation of aerial radio access networks and edge computing, which attempts to bridge the gap. Specifically, first, we propose a novel comprehensive computing architecture that is composed of low-altitude computing, high-altitude computing, and satellite computing platforms, along with conventional computing systems. We determine that aerial computing offers several desirable attributes: global computing service, better mobility, higher scalability and availability, and simultaneity. Second, we comprehensively discuss key technologies that facilitate aerial computing, including energy refilling, edge computing, network softwarization, frequency spectrum, multi-access techniques, artificial intelligence, and big data. In addition, we discuss vertical domain applications (e.g., smart cities, smart vehicles, smart factories, and smart grids) supported by aerial computing. Finally, we highlight several challenges that need to be addressed and their possible solutions.			arxiv	['Rukhsana Ruby', 'Fang Fang', 'Dinh C.

We show that there exists a strictly increasing sequence of rational numbers that is nearly computably Cauchy and unbounded. Then we call a real number $\alpha$ nearly computable if there exists a computable sequence $(a_n)_n$ of rational numbers that converges to $\alpha$ and is nearly computably Cauchy. It is clear that every computable real number is nearly computable, and it follows from a result by Downey and LaForte (2002) that there exists a nearly computable and left-computable number that is not computable. We observe that the set of nearly computable real numbers is a real closed field and closed under computable real functions with open domain, but not closed under arbitrary computable real functions. Among other things we strengthen results by Hoyrup (2017) and by Stephan and Wu (2005) by showing that any nearly computable real number that is not computable is weakly $1$-generic (and, therefore, hyperimmune and not Martin-L\""of random) and strongly Kurtz random (and, therefore, not $K$-trivial), and we strengthen a result by Downey and LaForte (2002) by showing that no promptly simple set can be Turing reducible to a nearly computable real number."			arxiv	['Philip Janicki']	43.0
144	Quantum Computing Using Crossed Atomic Beams	P. Blythe	2006-05-22 10:54:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605190v2	A quantum computer is a hypothetical device in which the laws of quantum mechanics are used to introduce a degree of parallelism into computations and which could therefore significantly improve on the computational speed of a classical computer at certain tasks. Cluster state quantum computing (recently proposed by Raussendorf and Briegel) is a new paradigm in quantum information processing and is a departure from the conventional model of quantum computation. The cluster state quantum computer begins by creating a highly entangled multi-particle state (the cluster state) which it uses as a quantum resource during the computation. Information is processed in the computer via selected measurements on individual qubits that form the cluster state. We describe in detail how a scalable quantum computer can be constructed using microwave cavity QED and, in a departure from the traditional understanding of a computer as a fixed array of computational elements, we show that cluster state quantum computing is well suited to atomic beam experiments. We show that all of the necessary elements have been individually realised, and that the construction of a truly scalable atomic beam quantum computer may be an experimental reality in the near future.			arxiv	['B.

These observations capture various situations pertinent to people's needs and interests along with all their idiosyncrasies. To support human-centered computing that empower people in making better and timely decisions, we look towards computation that is inspired by human perception and cognition. Toward this goal, we discuss computing paradigms of semantic computing, cognitive computing, and an emerging aspect of computing, which we call perceptual computing. In our view, these offer a continuum to make the most out of vast, growing, and diverse data pertinent to human needs and interests. We propose details of perceptual computing characterized by interpretation and exploration operations comparable to the interleaving of bottom and top brain processing. This article consists of two parts. First we describe semantic computing, cognitive computing, and perceptual computing to lay out distinctions while acknowledging their complementary capabilities. We then provide a conceptual overview of the newest of these three paradigms--perceptual computing. For further insights, we focus on an application scenario of asthma management converting massive, heterogeneous and multimodal (big) data into actionable information or smart data.			arxiv	['Pramod Anantharam', 'Cory Henson']	45.0
146	How Far Can We Go in Compute-less Networking: Computation Correctness and Accuracy	Boubakr Nour	2021-03-29 19:57:16	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15924v2	Emerging applications such as augmented reality and tactile Internet are compute-intensive and latency-sensitive, which hampers their running in constrained end devices alone or in the distant cloud. The stringent requirements of such application drove to the realization of Edge computing in which computation is offloaded near to users. Compute-less networking is an extension of edge computing that aims at reducing computation and abridging communication by adopting in-network computing and computation reuse. Computation reuse aims to cache the result of computations and use them to perform similar tasks in the future and, therefore, avoid redundant calculations and optimize the use of resources. In this paper, we focus on the correctness of the final output produced by computation reuse. Since the input might not be identical but similar, the reuse of previous computation raises questions about the accuracy of the final results. To this end, we implement a proof of concept to study and gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of computation reuse. We are able to reduce task completion time by up to 80% while ensuring high correctness. We further discuss open challenges and highlight future research directions.			arxiv	['Soumaya Cherkaoui']	46.0

Current computing mechanism is effective, particular for medium and small cloud based companies, in which it permits easy and reliable access to cloud services like infrastructure, software and platform. Present cloud computing is almost similar to the existing models: cluster computing and grid computing. The important key technical features of cloud computing which includes autonomic service, rapid elasticity, end-to-end virtualization support, on-demand resource pooling and transparency in cloud billing. Further, non-technical features of cloud computing includes environment friendliness, little maintenance overhead, lower upfront costs, faster time to deployments, Service Level Agreement (SLA) and pay-as-you-go-model. In distributed computing environment, unpredictability of service is a fact, so same possible in cloud also. The success of next-generation Cloud Computing infrastructures will depend on how capably these infrastructures will discover and dynamically tolerate computing platforms, which meet randomly varying resource and service requirements of Cloud costumer applications.			arxiv	[]	47.0
148	The Case for the Anonymization of Offloaded Computation	Md Washik Al Azad	2023-05-12 23:49:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07803v1	Computation offloading (often to external computing resources over a network) has become a necessity for modern applications. At the same time, the proliferation of machine learning techniques has empowered malicious actors to use such techniques in order to breach the privacy of the execution process for offloaded computations. This can enable malicious actors to identify offloaded computations and infer their nature based on computation characteristics that they may have access to even if they do not have direct access to the computation code. In this paper, we first demonstrate that even non-sophisticated machine learning algorithms can accurately identify offloaded computations. We then explore the design space of anonymizing offloaded computations through the realization of a framework, called Camouflage. Camouflage features practical mechanisms to conceal characteristics related to the execution of computations, which can be used by malicious actors to identify computations and orchestrate further attacks based on identified computations. Our evaluation demonstrated that Camouflage can impede the ability of malicious actors to identify executed computations by up to 60%, while incurring modest overheads for the anonymization of computations.			arxiv	['Shifat Sarwar', 'Sifat Ut Taki', 'Spyridon Mastorakis']	48.0
149	The Marriage of Incremental and Approximate Computing	Dhanya R Krishnan	2016-11-25 20:05:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08573v1	Most data analytics systems that require low-latency execution and efficient utilization of computing resources, increasingly adopt two computational paradigms, namely, incremental and approximate computing. Incremental computation updates the output incrementally instead of re-computing everything from scratch for successive runs of a job with input changes. Approximate computation returns an approximate output for a job instead of the exact output. Both paradigms rely on computing over a subset of data items instead of computing over the entire dataset, but they differ in their means for skipping parts of the computation. Incremental computing relies on the memoization of intermediate results of sub-computations, and reusing these memoized results across jobs for sub-computations that are unaffected by the changed input. Approximate computing relies on representative sampling of the entire dataset to compute over a subset of data items. In this thesis, we make the observation that these two computing paradigms are complementary, and can be married together! The high level idea is to: design a sampling algorithm that biases the sample selection to the memoized data items from previous runs. To concretize this idea, we designed an online stratified sampling algorithm that uses self-adjusting computation to produce an incrementally updated approximate output with bounded error. We implemented our algorithm in a data analytics system called IncAppox based on Apache Spark Streaming. Our evaluation of the system shows that IncApprox achieves the benefits of both incremental and approximate computing.			arxiv	[]	49.0

It is essential for real-time applications to transmit status update packets to the destination node as timely as possible. However, for some applications, status information embedded in the packets is not revealed until complicated data processing, which is computational expensive and time consuming. As mobile edge server has sufficient computational resource and is placed close to users, mobile edge computing (MEC) is expected to reduce age for computation-intensive messages. In this paper, we study the AoI for computation-intensive data in MEC, and consider two schemes: local computing by user itself and remote computing at MEC server. The two computing models are unified into a two-node tandem queuing model. Zero-wait policy is adopted, i.e., a new message is generated once the previous one leaves the first node. We consider exponentially distributed service time and infinite queue size, and hence, the second node can be seen as a First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) M/M/1 system. Closed-form average AoI is derived for the two computing schemes. The region where remote computing outperforms local computing is characterized. Simulation results show that the remote computing is greatly superior to the local computing when the remote computing rate is large enough, and that there exists an optimal transmission rate so that remote computing is better than local computing for a largest range.			arxiv	['Jie Gong', 'Xiang Chen', 'Xiao Ma']	50.0
151	Neuromorphic Computing is Turing-Complete	Prasanna Date	2021-04-28 19:25:01	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13983v1	Neuromorphic computing is a non-von Neumann computing paradigm that performs computation by emulating the human brain. Neuromorphic systems are extremely energy-efficient and known to consume thousands of times less power than CPUs and GPUs. They have the potential to drive critical use cases such as autonomous vehicles, edge computing and internet of things in the future. For this reason, they are sought to be an indispensable part of the future computing landscape. Neuromorphic systems are mainly used for spike-based machine learning applications, although there are some non-machine learning applications in graph theory, differential equations, and spike-based simulations. These applications suggest that neuromorphic computing might be capable of general-purpose computing. However, general-purpose computability of neuromorphic computing has not been established yet. In this work, we prove that neuromorphic computing is Turing-complete and therefore capable of general-purpose computing. Specifically, we present a model of neuromorphic computing, with just two neuron parameters (threshold and leak), and two synaptic parameters (weight and delay). We devise neuromorphic circuits for computing all the {\mu}-recursive functions (i.e., constant, successor and projection functions) and all the {\mu}-recursive operators (i.e., composition, primitive recursion and minimization operators). Given that the {\mu}-recursive functions and operators are precisely the ones that can be computed using a Turing machine, this work establishes the Turing-completeness of neuromorphic computing.			arxiv	['Catherine Schuman', 'Bill Kay', 'Thomas Potok']	51.0
152	Intelligent Computing: The Latest Advances, Challenges and Future	Shiqiang Zhu	2022-11-21 09:15:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11281v1	Computing is a critical driving force in the development of human civilization. In recent years, we have witnessed the emergence of intelligent computing, a new computing paradigm that is reshaping traditional computing and promoting digital revolution in the era of big data, artificial intelligence and internet-of-things with new computing theories, architectures, methods, systems, and applications. Intelligent computing has greatly broadened the scope of computing, extending it from traditional computing on data to increasingly diverse computing paradigms such as perceptual intelligence, cognitive intelligence, autonomous intelligence, and human-computer fusion intelligence. Intelligence and computing have undergone paths of different evolution and development for a long time but have become increasingly intertwined in recent years: intelligent computing is not only intelligence-oriented but also intelligence-driven. Such cross-fertilization has prompted the emergence and rapid advancement of intelligent computing. Intelligent computing is still in its infancy and an abundance of innovations in the theories, systems, and applications of intelligent computing are expected to occur soon. We present the first comprehensive survey of literature on intelligent computing, covering its theory fundamentals, the technological fusion of intelligence and computing, important applications, challenges, and future perspectives. We believe that this survey is highly timely and will provide a comprehensive reference and cast valuable insights into intelligent computing for academic and industrial researchers and practitioners.			arxiv	['Ting Yu', 'Tao Xu', 'Hongyang Chen', 'Schahram Dustdar', 'Sylvain Gigan', 'Deniz Gunduz', 'Ekram Hossain', 'Yaochu Jin', 'Feng Lin', 'Bo Liu', 'Zhiguo Wan', 'Ji Zhang', 'Zhifeng Zhao', 'Wentao Zhu', 'Zuoning Chen', 'Tariq Durrani', 'Huaimin Wang', 'Jiangxing Wu', 'Tongyi Zhang', 'Yunhe Pan']	53.0
153	Energy-Consumption Advantage of Quantum Computation	Florian Meier	2023-05-18 18:00:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11212v2	Energy consumption in solving computational problems has been gaining growing attention as a part of the performance measures of computers. Quantum computation is known to offer advantages over classical computation in terms of various computational resources; however, its advantage in energy consumption has been challenging to analyze due to the lack of a theoretical foundation to relate the physical notion of energy and the computer-scientific notion of complexity for quantum computation with finite computational resources. To bridge this gap, we introduce a general framework for studying the energy consumption of quantum and classical computation based on a computational model that has been conventionally used for studying query complexity in computational complexity theory. With this framework, we derive an upper bound for the achievable energy consumption of quantum computation. We also develop techniques for proving a nonzero lower bound of energy consumption of classical computation based on the energy-conservation law and Landauer's principle. With these general bounds, we rigorously prove that quantum computation achieves an exponential energy-consumption advantage over classical computation for solving a specific computational problem, Simon's problem. Furthermore, we clarify how to demonstrate this energy-consumption advantage of quantum computation in an experimental setting. These results provide a fundamental framework and techniques to explore the physical meaning of quantum advantage in the query-complexity setting based on energy consumption, opening an alternative way to study the advantages of quantum computation.			arxiv	['Hayata Yamasaki']	54.0

Examples of such models are cellular automata, spatial computation and space-time crystallography. For any computational model it is natural to define a functional equivalence of different but related computational structures. In the finite automata theory an example of such equivalence is automata homomorphism and, in particular, automata isomorphism. If we continue to stick to the finite automata theory, a fundamental question arise, what a state of a distributed computational structure is. This work is devoted to particular solution of the issue.			arxiv	[]	59.0

However, due to limitations in scalability of quantum technologies, it seems that we are far from constructing universal quantum computers for everyday users. A more feasible solution is the delegation of computation to powerful quantum servers on the network. This solution was proposed in previous studies of Blind Quantum Computation, with guarantees for both the secrecy of the input and of the computation being performed.

In this work, we explore a new computation scheme, in which the linear operators in quantum computing are replaced by (higher) functors between two (higher) categories. If from Turing computing to quantum computing is the first quantization of computation, then this new scheme can be viewed as the second quantization of computation.

We propose successive approximation coding (SAC) techniques that realize a tradeoff between accuracy and speed, allowing the distributed computing system to produce approximations that increase in accuracy over time. If a sufficient number of compute nodes finish their tasks, SAC exactly recovers the desired computation. We theoretically provide design guidelines for our SAC techniques, and numerically show that SAC achieves a better accuracy-speed tradeoff in comparison with previous methods.			arxiv	['Stark C.

The quantum field computation model contains the quantum computation model of Feynman. (The term ""quantum field computer"" was used by Freedman.) Quantum field computation (as enhanced by Wightman's model of quantum field theory) involves computation over the continuum which is remarkably related to the real computation model of Smale. The latter model was established as a generalization of Turing computation. All this is not surprising since it is well known that the physics of quantum field theory (which includes Einstein's special relativity) contains quantum mechanics which in turn contains classical mechanics. The unity of these computing models, which seem to have grown largely independently, could shed new light into questions of computational complexity, into the central P (Polynomial time) versus NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial time) problem of computer science, and also into the description of Nature by fundamental physics theories."			arxiv	[]	78.0

178	Point-Separable Classes of Simple Computable Planar Curves	Xizhong Zheng	2012-08-08 21:34:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2245v2	In mathematics curves are typically defined as the images of continuous real functions (parametrizations) defined on a closed interval. They can also be defined as connected one-dimensional compact subsets of points. For simple curves of finite lengths, parametrizations can be further required to be injective or even length-normalized. All of these four approaches to curves are classically equivalent. In this paper we investigate four different versions of computable curves based on these four approaches. It turns out that they are all different, and hence, we get four different classes of computable curves. More interestingly, these four classes are even point-separable in the sense that the sets of points covered by computable curves of different versions are also different. However, if we consider only computable curves of computable lengths, then all four versions of computable curves become equivalent. This shows that the definition of computable curves is robust, at least for those of computable lengths. In addition, we show that the class of computable curves of computable lengths is point-separable from the other four classes of computable curves.			arxiv	['Robert Rettinger']	80.0
179	Computing in matrix groups without memory	Peter J. Cameron	2013-10-22 18:47:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6009v1	Memoryless computation is a novel means of computing any function of a set of registers by updating one register at a time while using no memory. We aim to emulate how computations are performed on modern cores, since they typically involve updates of single registers. The computation model of memoryless computation can be fully expressed in terms of transformation semigroups, or in the case of bijective functions, permutation groups. In this paper, we view registers as elements of a finite field and we compute linear permutations without memory. We first determine the maximum complexity of a linear function when only linear instructions are allowed. We also determine which linear functions are hardest to compute when the field in question is the binary field and the number of registers is even. Secondly, we investigate some matrix groups, thus showing that the special linear group is internally computable but not fast. Thirdly, we determine the smallest set of instructions required to generate the special and general linear groups. These results are important for memoryless computation, for they show that linear functions can be computed very fast or that very few instructions are needed to compute any linear function. They thus indicate new advantages of using memoryless computation.			arxiv	['Ben Fairbairn', 'Maximilien Gadouleau']	81.0

Coded computation techniques leverage coding theory to inject computational redundancy and mitigate stragglers in distributed computations. In this paper, we propose a dynamic workload distribution strategy for coded computation called Slack Squeeze Coded Computation ($S^2C^2$). $S^2C^2$ squeezes the compute slack (i.e., overhead) that is built into the coded computing frameworks by efficiently assigning work for all fast and slow nodes according to their speeds and without needing to re-distribute data. We implement an LSTM-based speed prediction algorithm to predict speeds of compute nodes. We evaluate $S^2C^2$ on linear algebraic algorithms, gradient descent, graph ranking, and graph filtering algorithms. We demonstrate 19% to 39% reduction in total computation latency using $S^2C^2$ compared to job replication and coded computation. We further show how $S^2C^2$ can be applied beyond matrix-vector multiplication.			arxiv	['Zhifeng Lin', 'Mehrdad Kiamari', 'Salman Avestimehr', 'Murali Annavaram']	83.0
182	Quantum-Inspired Computing: Can it be a Microscopic Computing Model of the Brain?	Yasunao Katayama	2019-04-11 01:12:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10508v2	Quantum computing and the workings of the brain have many aspects in common and have been attracting increasing attention in academia and industry. The computation in both is parallel and non-discrete. Though the underlying physical dynamics (e.g., equation of motion) may be deterministic, the observed or interpreted outcomes are often probabilistic. Consequently, various investigations have been undertaken to understand and reproduce the brain on the basis of quantum physics and computing. However, there have been arguments on whether the brain can and have to take advantage of quantum phenomena that need to survive in the macroscopic space-time region at room temperature. This paper presents a unique microscopic computational model for the brain based on an ansatz that the brain computes in a manner similar to quantum computing, but with classical waves. Log-scale encoding of information in the context of computing with waves is shown to play a critical role in bridging the computing models with classical and quantum waves. Our quantum-inspired computing model opens up a possibility of unifying the computing framework of artificial intelligence and quantum computing beyond quantum machine learning approaches.			arxiv	[]	84.0

The need for more performant, comfortable and safe computing forced to develop and utilize several tricks both in hardware and software. Till now technology enabled to increase performance without changing the basic computing paradigms. The recent stalling of single-threaded computing performance, however, requires to redesign computing to be able to provide the expected performance. To do so, the computing paradigms themselves must be scrutinized. The limitations caused by the too restrictive interpretation of the computing paradigms are demonstrated, an extended computing paradigm introduced, ideas about changing elements of the computing stack suggested, some implementation details of both hardware and software discussed. The resulting new computing stack offers considerably higher computing throughput, simplified hardware architecture, drastically improved real-time behavior and in general, simplified and more efficient computing stack.			arxiv	[]	85.0

Next to researchers and vendors of future computing technologies, national authorities are showing strong interest in maturing this technology due to its known potential to break many of today's encryption techniques, which would have significant impact on our society. It is however quite likely that quantum computing has beneficial impact on many computational disciplines. In this article we describe our vision of future developments in scientific computing that would be enabled by the advent of software-programmable quantum computers. We thereby assume that quantum computers will form part of a hybrid accelerated computing platform like GPUs and co-processor cards do today. In particular, we address the potential of quantum algorithms to bring major breakthroughs in applied mathematics and its applications. Finally, we give several examples that demonstrate the possible impact of quantum-accelerated scientific computing on society.			arxiv	['Cornelis Vuik']	86.0
185	Proof-of-work certificates that can be efficiently computed in the cloud	Jean-Guillaume Dumas	2018-06-29 08:13:29	http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11293v2	In an emerging computing paradigm, computational capabilities, from processing power to storage capacities, are offered to users over communication networks as a cloud-based service. There, demanding computations are outsourced in order to limit infrastructure costs. The idea of verifiable computing is to associate a data structure, a proof-of-work certificate, to the result of the outsourced computation. This allows a verification algorithm to prove the validity of the result, faster than by recomputing it. We talk about a Prover (the server performing the computations) and a Verifier. Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum gave in 2008 a generic method to verify any parallelizable computation, in almost linear time in the size of the, potentially structured, inputs and the result. However, the extra cost of the computations for the Prover (and therefore the extra cost to the customer), although only almost a constant factor of the overall work, is nonetheless prohibitive in practice. Differently, we will here present problem-specific procedures in computer algebra, e.g. for exact linear algebra computations, that are Prover-optimal, that is that have much less financial overhead.			arxiv	[]	87.0
186	Computation Efficiency Maximization in Wireless-Powered Mobile Edge Computing Networks	Fuhui Zhou	2020-01-28 09:50:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10234v2	Energy-efficient computation is an inevitable trend for mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. Resource allocation strategies for maximizing the computation efficiency are critically important. In this paper, computation efficiency maximization problems are formulated in wireless-powered MEC networks under both partial and binary computation offloading modes. A practical non-linear energy harvesting model is considered. Both time division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are considered and evaluated for offloading. The energy harvesting time, the local computing frequency, and the offloading time and power are jointly optimized to maximize the computation efficiency under the max-min fairness criterion. Two iterative algorithms and two alternative optimization algorithms are respectively proposed to address the non-convex problems formulated in this paper. Simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation schemes outperform the benchmark schemes in terms of user fairness. Moreover, a tradeoff is elucidated between the achievable computation efficiency and the total number of computed bits. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate that the partial computation offloading mode outperforms the binary computation offloading mode and NOMA outperforms TDMA in terms of computation efficiency.			arxiv	['Rose Qingyang Hu']	88.0
187	Controlling Computation versus Quality for Neural Sequence Models	Ankur Bapna	2020-02-17 17:54:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07106v2	Most neural networks utilize the same amount of compute for every example independent of the inherent complexity of the input. Further, methods that adapt the amount of computation to the example focus on finding a fixed inference-time computational graph per example, ignoring any external computational budgets or varying inference time limitations. In this work, we utilize conditional computation to make neural sequence models (Transformer) more efficient and computation-aware during inference. We first modify the Transformer architecture, making each set of operations conditionally executable depending on the output of a learned control network. We then train this model in a multi-task setting, where each task corresponds to a particular computation budget. This allows us to train a single model that can be controlled to operate on different points of the computation-quality trade-off curve, depending on the available computation budget at inference time. We evaluate our approach on two tasks: (i) WMT English-French Translation and (ii) Unsupervised representation learning (BERT). Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed Conditional Computation Transformer (CCT) is competitive with vanilla Transformers when allowed to utilize its full computational budget, while improving significantly over computationally equivalent baselines when operating on smaller computational budgets.			arxiv	['Naveen Arivazhagan', 'Orhan Firat']	89.0
188	Analog Computation and Representation	Corey J. Maley	2020-12-10 20:44:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05965v1	Relative to digital computation, analog computation has been neglected in the philosophical literature. To the extent that attention has been paid to analog computation, it has been misunderstood. The received view -- that analog computation has to do essentially with continuity -- is simply wrong, as shown by careful attention to historical examples of discontinuous, discrete analog computers. Instead of the received view, I develop an account of analog computation in terms of a particular type of analog representation that allows for discontinuity. This account thus characterizes all types of analog computation, whether continuous or discrete. Furthermore, the structure of this account can be generalized to other types of computation: analog computation essentially involves analog representation, whereas digital computation essentially involves digital representation. Besides being a necessary component of a complete philosophical understanding of computation in general, understanding analog computation is important for computational explanation in contemporary neuroscience and cognitive science.			arxiv	[]	90.0
189	Consideration of the Need for Quantum Grid Computing	Dominic Rosch-Grace	2021-06-21 18:19:22	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11341v1	Quantum computing is poised to dramatically change the computational landscape, worldwide. Quantum computers can solve complex problems that are, at least in some cases, beyond the ability of even advanced future classical-style computers. In addition to being able to solve these classical computer-unsolvable problems, quantum computers have demonstrated a capability to solve some problems (such as prime factoring) much more efficiently than classical computing. This will create problems for encryption techniques, which depend on the difficulty of factoring for their security. Security, scientific, and other applications will require access to quantum computing resources to access their unique capabilities, speed and economic (aggregate computing time cost) benefits. Many scientific applications, as well as numerous other ones, use grid computing to provide benefits such as scalability and resource access. As these applications may benefit from quantum capabilities - and some future applications may require quantum capabilities - identifying how to integrate quantum computing systems into grid computing environments is critical. This paper discusses the benefits of grid-connected quantum computers and what is required to achieve this.			arxiv	['Jeremy Straub']	91.0

However, we are seeing a paradigm shift in the computational structure, design, and requirements of these applications. Increasingly, data-driven and machine learning approaches are being used to support, speed-up, and enhance scientific computing applications, especially molecular dynamics simulations. Concurrently, cloud computing platforms are increasingly appealing for scientific computing, providing ""infinite"" computing powers, easier programming and deployment models, and access to computing accelerators such as TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). This confluence of machine learning (ML) and cloud computing represents exciting opportunities for cloud and systems researchers. ML-assisted molecular dynamics simulations are a new class of workload, and exhibit unique computational patterns. These simulations present new challenges for low-cost and high-performance execution. We argue that transient cloud resources, such as low-cost preemptible cloud VMs, can be a viable platform for this new workload. Finally, we present some low-hanging fruits and long-term challenges in cloud resource management, and the integration of molecular dynamics simulations into ML platforms (such as TensorFlow)."			arxiv	['Vikram Jadhao']	92.0
191	Age of Information of Multi-user Mobile Edge Computing Systems	Zhifeng Tang	2022-11-02 04:43:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00874v1	In this paper, we analyze the average age of information (AoI) and the average peak AoI (PAoI) of a multiuser mobile edge computing (MEC) system where a base station (BS) generates and transmits computation-intensive packets to user equipments (UEs). In this MEC system, we focus on three computing schemes: (i) The local computing scheme where all computational tasks are computed by the local server at the UE, (ii) The edge computing scheme where all computational tasks are computed by the edge server at the BS, and (iii) The partial computing scheme where computational tasks are partially allocated at the edge server and the rest are computed by the local server. Considering exponentially distributed transmission time and computation time and adopting the first come first serve (FCFS) queuing policy, we derive closed-form expressions for the average AoI and average PAoI. To address the complexity of the average AoI expression, we derive simple upper and lower bounds on the average AoI, which allow us to explicitly examine the dependence of the optimal offloading decision on the MEC system parameters. Aided by simulation results, we verify our analysis and illustrate the impact of system parameters on the AoI performance.			arxiv	['Zhuo Sun', 'Nan Yang', 'Xiangyun Zhou']	93.0
192	Computation Environments, An Interactive Semantics for Turing Machines (which P is not equal to NP considering it)	Rasoul Ramezanian	2012-05-27 19:21:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5994v1	To scrutinize notions of computation and time complexity, we introduce and formally define an interactive model for computation that we call it the \emph{computation environment}. A computation environment consists of two main parts: i) a universal processor and ii) a computist who uses the computability power of the universal processor to perform effective procedures. The notion of computation finds it meaning, for the computist, through his \underline{interaction} with the universal processor. We are interested in those computation environments which can be considered as alternative for the real computation environment that the human being is its computist. These computation environments must have two properties: 1- being physically plausible, and 2- being enough powerful. Based on Copeland' criteria for effective procedures, we define what a \emph{physically plausible} computation environment is. We construct two \emph{physically plausible} and \emph{enough powerful} computation environments: 1- the Turing computation environment, denoted by $E_T$, and 2- a persistently evolutionary computation environment, denoted by $E_e$, which persistently evolve in the course of executing the computations. We prove that the equality of complexity classes $\mathrm{P}$ and $\mathrm{NP}$ in the computation environment $E_e$ conflicts with the \underline{free will} of the computist. We provide an axiomatic system $\mathcal{T}$ for Turing computability and prove that ignoring just one of the axiom of $\mathcal{T}$, it would not be possible to derive $\mathrm{P=NP}$ from the rest of axioms. We prove that the computist who lives inside the environment $E_T$, can never be confident that whether he lives in a static environment or a persistently evolutionary one.			arxiv	[]	94.0
193	Aqua Computing: Coupling Computing and Communications	Chathura Sarathchandra Magurawalage	2015-10-25 14:27:22	http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07250v1	The authors introduce a new vision for providing computing services for connected devices. It is based on the key concept that future computing resources will be coupled with communication resources, for enhancing user experience of the connected users, and also for optimising resources in the providers' infrastructures. Such coupling is achieved by Joint/Cooperative resource allocation algorithms, by integrating computing and communication services and by integrating hardware in networks. Such type of computing, by which computing services are not delivered independently but dependent of networking services, is named Aqua Computing. The authors see Aqua Computing as a novel approach for delivering computing resources to end devices, where computing power of the devices are enhanced automatically once they are connected to an Aqua Computing enabled network. The process of resource coupling is named computation dissolving. Then, an Aqua Computing architecture is proposed for mobile edge networks, in which computing and wireless networking resources are allocated jointly or cooperatively by a Mobile Cloud Controller, for the benefit of the end-users and/or for the benefit of the service providers. Finally, a working prototype of the system is shown and the gathered results show the performance of the Aqua Computing prototype.			arxiv	['Kun Yang', 'Kezhi Wang']	95.0
194	When does a physical system compute?	Dominic Horsman	2013-09-30 19:37:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7979v3	Computing is a high-level process of a physical system. Recent interest in non-standard computing systems, including quantum and biological computers, has brought this physical basis of computing to the forefront. There has been, however, no consensus on how to tell if a given physical system is acting as a computer or not; leading to confusion over novel computational devices, and even claims that every physical event is a computation. In this paper we introduce a formal framework that can be used to determine whether or not a physical system is performing a computation. We demonstrate how the abstract computational level interacts with the physical device level, drawing the comparison with the use of mathematical models to represent physical objects in experimental science. This powerful formulation allows a precise description of the similarities between experiments, computation, simulation, and technology, leading to our central conclusion: physical computing is the use of a physical system to predict the outcome of an abstract evolution. We give conditions that must be satisfied in order for computation to be occurring, and illustrate these with a range of non-standard computing scenarios. The framework also covers broader computing contexts, where there is no obvious human computer user. We define the critical notion of a 'computational entity', and show the role this plays in defining when computing is taking place in physical systems.			arxiv	['Susan Stepney', 'Rob C.

Furthermore, since decades the idea of exploiting nonlinear physical phenomena ""directly"" for non-digital computing has been explored under names like ""unconventional computing"", ""natural computing"", ""physical computing"", or ""in-materio computing"". This has been taking place in niches which are small compared to other sectors of computer science. In this paper I stake out the grounds of how a general concept of ""computing"" can be developed which comprises digital, neuromorphic, unconventional and possible future ""computing"" paradigms. The main contribution of this paper is a wide-scope survey of existing formal conceptualizations of ""computing"". The survey inspects approaches rooted in three different kinds of background mathematics: discrete-symbolic formalisms, probabilistic modeling, and dynamical-systems oriented views. It turns out that different choices of background mathematics lead to decisively different understandings of what ""computing"" is. Across all of this diversity, a unifying coordinate system for theorizing about ""computing"" can be distilled. Within these coordinates I locate anchor points for a foundational formal theory of a future computing-engineering discipline that includes, but will reach beyond, digital and neuromorphic computing."			arxiv	[]	97.0

My laptop finally bit the dust this past week, and this morning more specifically. The laptop will not turn on with the power button. However, if I put the charger in (which was working last night), the blue light stays on (indicating that the laptop is fully charged, blinking I believe means charging). Even with the cord plugged into the wall and into the laptop, or removed from the wall but still in the laptop, or fully unplugged, the computer does not turn on. Interestingly, the week before, the WiFi adapter card wasn't working, more specifically the Killer Wifi 6AX1650i 160mhz wireless adapter card wouldn't stay on. Periodically, it would turn on indiscriminately. Sometimes if I did a network reset and windows update, or did a restart and wired connection, sometimes if I manually went into the KillerControlSense and turned on the wireless ""Xtend""er button. The culprit? I was using the laptop at high energy on a blanket (rarely do that), but didn't put it to sleep. I thought I shut it off, but I returned to my bedroom after eight hours to find it super hot, which I prompted me to elevate it, put on full fans on max turbo mode, and then keep using it for an hour, on WiFi, and charging. My only assumption is that after three years of heavy usage on a wooden surface (and recently last night on my blanket), that I may have melted or sparked something in the motherboard, or perhaps clogged it, or just didn't update the Bios and WiFi card (which I had thought I had did…) I am to take off the backboard and try to find a reset button, or reseating some components and getting a closer look.

Games like Valorant, Counter-Strike, or Steam games like Lethal Company, Phasmophobia. I recently found out eGPUs are a thing and I was wondering if it is possible to have an eGPU for my laptop. Based on some videos and Reddit threads eGPUs connected to your laptop have a bit lower performance as the signal goes from the laptop to the eGPU and back. So I do have a random China made monitor my dad got for me but I don’t know what brand is it or what refresh rate is the monitor. But the main thing is can I have an eGPU to make gaming experience on my laptop better? Or is it better to just upgrade altogether?	2.0	t3_18wmhwp	reddit

The only way to get it to post with one stick after trying with both is to clear the BIOS settings by removing the CMOS battery. Even then it will only work sometimes. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.

Maybe that's overkill to just play Fortnite on? Maybe any other PC recommended. Well maybe just as anyone had bad experience with this PC? Any information be grateful thanks for your time. I'm not being lazy I have done lots of researche but sometimes if you dont understand what you're reading you come here to Reddit.	4.0	t3_18vhqm1	reddit		
251	Switching the shells of a 4090	Unknown	2023-12-31 21:22:38	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18vhgr0	I’m just going to ask here before I email Zotac. I recently got a 4090 from them about 2-3 months ago, and I’ve been wanting to change the shell of it to white. Is there a way to just buy the shelling (covering whatever you call it) to swap out my black for white? Will this void my warranty? Should I even try to contact Zotac? If I remember correctly I could be wrong or thinking of something else. But I swear I read online or in the user handbook that if you get permission from Zotac to modify your GPU you don’t have to void your warranty	2.0	t3_18vhgr0	reddit

I'll keep it short and simple. If you bought a gaming pc or any pc and it came with no trace of the windows store at all, do this. 1. Delete the xbox and microsoft store by going into settings - apps - installed apps - and uninstall them fromt here. If they don't show up then dont worry about it. 2. Go to your web browser and download xbox app from microsoft. 3. Once downloaded restart your pc 4. Once restarted open up the xbox app. It should pop up with a bunch of errors and stuff you need to do. One of which is installing the store 5. On the error that says microsoft store, click install. 6. Enjoy	1.0	t3_18vavod	reddit

I want to gift it to my niece and nephew, as it is significantly better for gaming then what they Minecraft on now, and it isn't as good as my current Asus laptop, plus I know my uncle would've been pleased knowing that his computer is going to good use, as he was always a tech savant. Anyway, in the clearing out of his home, as well as a recent move, I LOST the notebook in which he wrote down his passwords. The clue is DrWho, and my limited knowledge of that isn't helping me crack it... I'm working with Window's 10, both on the MSI that I need factory reset (thus need access), and my Asus. How can I either deactivate, bypass, or reset the password? Any help would be greatly appreciated!!! &#x200B; UPDATE: Apparently I can reset Windows and wipe the computer to factory reset without need of the password. I am worried that I'm going to have to pay for a windows installation, if that gets wiped. &#x200B; SOLUTION: Holding Shift while restarting the computer allowed me to access options for resetting Windows and wiping the drives to factory settings. Took all night, but the drives were formatted and Windows auto-reinstalled!	4.0	t3_18v051m	reddit

I sometimes get an error saying anti-cheat has a problem and that I should restart my computer but even after restarting nothing is changed. Chrome has also been acting up crashing and or saying it doesn’t have enough memory to open this page. My computer has also entirely crashed and gone to an empty black screen with no response. I have tried everything I know to try and fix it I made sure I have a decent amount of storage on my pc (roughly half) I have cleaned it using the windows settings cleaner but I also downloaded a new pc cleaning software and while that was in the process of cleaning it crashed.

But I'm trying to plug it into the motherboard now and even when it's on it says there is no signal coming from it. From what I can tell to fix this I have to enter the BIOS for the motherboard and enable something to let me plug in a display to it, but when I restart the computer the monitor stops receiving signal. I can't enter BIOS because restarting the computer seemingly doesn't work. Once it restarts and the computer turns back on the monitor doesn't say that it is receiving any input. The monitor only works again if I shut off my computer and then turn it on again, but I can't enter BIOS that way because it goes straight to the windows start up. Does anyone know how I can fix this or enter BIOS a different way? Im pretty stuck here	3.0	t3_18us7gi	reddit

The only option then: unplug it. I have to start the PC and first disconnect everything connected via USB. Then it starts up to *see Photo 2* - then I plug in the USB connectors and can press F1, the PC continues to start, and I can use everything normally. The problem is that I don't want to unplug all USB connectors under the desk every time just to plug them back in after the start. I've already changed the BIOS battery - so it doesn't seem to be the issue. What can I do to make it start normally? Looking forward to your responses, thank you."""	7.0	t3_18upezu	reddit

290	PC annoyingly booting into Bios after first booting into Advance System Settings	Unknown	2023-12-30 03:58:12	https://www.reddit.com/r/computer/comments/18u6ams/pc_annoyingly_booting_into_bios_after_first/	Greetings to the Experts, I would like some assistants with my gaming PC. I use an MSI Motherboard with an SSID of 1TB. Recently, out of nowhere, I was booted into the blue screened Advanced Systems Setting window. I did not want to factory reset, so I tried everything else I had as options to no avail. The next boot, took me straight into bios. I looked up some youtube videos and saw that if I saved and exited, it would reboot without changing anything. I did like so, and the boot process repeated. Hence, I changed the admin password to be blank because I was tired of continuously typing it in. That is when it basically locked me out. I would press enter, it would say invalid, regardless of whether I inputed any pass info or not. 1. I need to be able to get into BIOS with or without a default password (which I think does not exist for desktops) 2. I need a solution to let me boot normally into windows 11 instead of BIOS (btw, all options for changes in BIOS do not register and are not available for change) 3. How can I protect my PC from whatever the problem was? Finally, I apologize for so much debuckery here, and I hope that here, I can find the solution. Thank you all for caring.	3.0	t3_18u6ams	reddit

Unknown	2023-12-29 15:49:41	https://www.reddit.com/r/computer/comments/18tq4ce/computer_crashing_every_half_hour_but_stops_when/	"I've been having this really unfortunate issue where I've experience a large amount of crashing every day whenever I get onto my computer. Though I've figured out that I rarely crash if I'm in a game, my event viewer ceases to pop up errors besides a game bar one which I still don't know how to fix that one, but otherwise if I have a game running in the background it stays alive. But I'm trying to solve the mystery of ""why"" the crashes are just black screens so I can't even get a blue-screen message to have any clue. My event viewer just says its a kernel power error. Losing power or just unexpected shutdown. I think it might be a ram issue, since my memory isn't doing anything when it's idling. But when playing games it's like full throttling so maybe it's the ram? Or the sockets for the ram? I've tried two powersupplies and it's pretty much the same issues either way. Graphics card as well. Motherboards and cpus are pretty expensive for me so I can't afford the test of swapping and seeing if it works. Could someone give me a idea of what my symptoms might be pointing towards? Before you ask yes, I've done alot of recommended testing before posting this.

I should also note that my PC is not overheating at all according to what MSI Afterburner says. CPU is always on 58c while the GPU is not going past 60c. I have no clue what to do honestly, and i've tried everything I could. Like changing the thermal paste on the CPU, taking off the tempered glass for better cooling and increasing fan speed. None of those fixed my issue. I don't know if it's a PSU issue or if it's something else. All i'm hoping is that the problem isn't the GPU itself. I bought the PC second hand and I didn't notice anything out of order when I tested it before buying it. I'd appreciate any help, i'll take every suggestion, I also have done a fair amout of benchmarks like Heaven, Superposition, UserBenchmark, Furmark and Cinebench. None of them caused my pc to reboot. I have the latest NVIDIA drivers and for more information my rig is: CPU: I3-10100F GPU: RTX 2060 RAM: 16GB DDR4 MB: Asrock something PSU: Cougar Gaming 550w STX Possibly also worth noting i had the same issue on a different PC other than this one.

309	Boot Lag	Unknown	2023-12-29 16:50:44	https://www.reddit.com/r/computer/comments/18triqp/boot_lag/	Good morning everyone. When I start my computer, it lags like crazy for the first 20-30 minutes (time varies). The cursor skips on the screen, the audio skips which matches the cursor skip, and lastly the frames skip aswell. Monitoring my performance, CPU is steady, memory is steady, GPU jumps between 15% and 30% usage but doesn't flatline. The main thing I don't understand and I need help with, it skips and stutters like CRAZY, after startup. Then it will proceed to work absolutely fine, zero issues for the entirety of the time it remains running. It can go to sleep, wake up, and operate completely fine. It can run for 24 hours and not skip again. I have re-installed all my drivers, I have factory-reset my entire PC two separate times now. I thought I had solved it, but it is doing it this morning again. I don't understand, and its very, very frustrating. I absolutely appreciate any help anyone can think of... I am out of ideas... My initial thoughts were it was a startup issue / windows issue, but it's been freshly installed twice as I mentioned. Specs for help if needed CPU: Ryzen 7 3700X RAM: 32 GB GPU: Geforce RTX 2060 // Driver 546.33 Startup Drive: Corsair Neutron XTI SSD Side Drive 1: Intel SSD Side Drive 2: Western Digital Black M.2 \------ Windows 10 \------ I really, REALLY appreciate any help... I use my computer for work aswell as leisure, and waking up in the morning to begin a project or whatever is on the plate for the day is really, really frustrating and distracting having to come back and check it on and off constantly to see if it stops.... I would really like to just solve the problem... Even just typing this message is stuttering.

It makes me sound like I'm an alien or something. I thought it was an issue with the microphone on the headset I use, but I've had the same issue with the microphone built into my computer. However, it's not something that happens all the time. Some days my microphone will be fine but then moments later my voice will start bugging out again. Does anyone know how I can fix this or what's causing this to happen? It's really annoying and it's starting to get frustrating.	1.0	t3_18tbgz4	reddit

So I wanted to know if it's safe to have most or almost all of the photos you have saved on a USB stick. For reference, some of these photos are as old as 2001. My father at the time was the only one in the family who understood computers, and later all images were saved on our computer (most family members phone photos also). So we had this family photo archive on our computers for a long time. But as we got older, I got myself a laptop and my brother a computer for gaming. Still, all the photos were on my laptop, but I ran out of space, so my father put them on a USB. I'm just wondering if there is a better way to store these photos or if a USB is good enough. I'm kind of scared of losing not just photos from my childhood but from my cousins as well.	6.0	t3_18sqq23	reddit

Human's interaction with the computer has modified with the passage of time as improvement in technology occurred the better the human computer interaction became. Today we are facilitated by the operating system that has reduced all the complexity of hardware and we undergo our computation in a very convenient way irrespective of the process occurring at the hardware level. Though the human computer interaction has improved but it's not done yet.

Human's interaction with the computer has modified with the passage of time as improvement in technology occurred the better the human computer interaction became. Today we are facilitated by the operating system that has reduced all the complexity of hardware and we undergo our computation in a very convenient way irrespective of the process occurring at the hardware level. Though the human computer interaction has improved but it's not done yet.

373	How to Optimally Allocate Resources for Coded Distributed Computing?	Qian Yu	2017-02-23 17:06:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07297v1	Today's data centers have an abundance of computing resources, hosting server clusters consisting of as many as tens or hundreds of thousands of machines. To execute a complex computing task over a data center, it is natural to distribute computations across many nodes to take advantage of parallel processing. However, as we allocate more and more computing resources to a computation task and further distribute the computations, large amounts of (partially) computed data must be moved between consecutive stages of computation tasks among the nodes, hence the communication load can become the bottleneck. In this paper, we study the optimal allocation of computing resources in distributed computing, in order to minimize the total execution time in distributed computing accounting for both the duration of computation and communication phases. In particular, we consider a general MapReduce-type distributed computing framework, in which the computation is decomposed into three stages: \emph{Map}, \emph{Shuffle}, and \emph{Reduce}. We focus on a recently proposed \emph{Coded Distributed Computing} approach for MapReduce and study the optimal allocation of computing resources in this framework. For all values of problem parameters, we characterize the optimal number of servers that should be used for distributed processing, provide the optimal placements of the Map and Reduce tasks, and propose an optimal coded data shuffling scheme, in order to minimize the total execution time. To prove the optimality of the proposed scheme, we first derive a matching information-theoretic converse on the execution time, then we prove that among all possible resource allocation schemes that achieve the minimum execution time, our proposed scheme uses the exactly minimum possible number of servers.			arxiv	['Songze Li', 'Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali', 'A.

374	The Complexity of Human Computation: A Concrete Model with an Application to Passwords	Manuel Blum	2017-07-05 03:25:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01204v1	"What can humans compute in their heads? We are thinking of a variety of Crypto Protocols, games like Sudoku, Crossword Puzzles, Speed Chess, and so on. The intent of this paper is to apply the ideas and methods of theoretical computer science to better understand what humans can compute in their heads. For example, can a person compute a function in their head so that an eavesdropper with a powerful computer --- who sees the responses to random input --- still cannot infer responses to new inputs? To address such questions, we propose a rigorous model of human computation and associated measures of complexity. We apply the model and measures first and foremost to the problem of (1) humanly computable password generation, and then consider related problems of (2) humanly computable ""one-way functions"" and (3) humanly computable ""pseudorandom generators"". The theory of Human Computability developed here plays by different rules than standard computability, and this takes some getting used to. For reasons to be made clear, the polynomial versus exponential time divide of modern computability theory is irrelevant to human computation. In human computability, the step-counts for both humans and computers must be more concrete. Specifically, we restrict the adversary to at most 10^24 (Avogadro number of) steps. An alternate view of this work is that it deals with the analysis of algorithms and counting steps for the case that inputs are small as opposed to the usual case of inputs large-in-the-limit."			arxiv	['Santosh Vempala']	127.0
375	A locality-based approach for coded computation	Michael Rudow	2020-02-06 18:46:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02440v1	Modern distributed computation infrastructures are often plagued by unavailabilities such as failing or slow servers. These unavailabilities adversely affect the tail latency of computation in distributed infrastructures. The simple solution of replicating computation entails significant resource overhead. Coded computation has emerged as a resource-efficient alternative, wherein multiple units of data are encoded to create parity units and the function to be computed is applied to each of these units on distinct servers. A decoder can use the available function outputs to decode the unavailable ones. Existing coded computation approaches are resource efficient only for simple variants of linear functions such as multilinear, with even the class of low degree polynomials requiring the same multiplicative overhead as replication for practically relevant straggler tolerance. In this paper, we present a new approach to model coded computation via the lens of locality of codes. We introduce a generalized notion of locality, denoted computational locality, building upon the locality of an appropriately defined code. We show that computational locality is equivalent to the required number of workers for coded computation and leverage results from the well-studied locality of codes to design coded computation schemes. We show that recent results on coded computation of multivariate polynomials can be derived using local recovering schemes for Reed-Muller codes. We present coded computation schemes for multivariate polynomials that adaptively exploit locality properties of input data-- an inadmissible technique under existing frameworks. These schemes require fewer workers than the lower bound under existing coded computation frameworks, showing that the existing multiplicative overhead on the number of servers is not fundamental for coded computation of nonlinear functions.			arxiv	['K.

376	Graph for Science: From API based Programming to Graph Engine based Programming for HPC	Yu Zhang	2023-12-08 08:33:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04900v1	Modern scientific applications predominantly run on large-scale computing platforms, necessitating collaboration between scientific domain experts and high-performance computing (HPC) experts. While domain experts are often skilled in customizing domain-specific scientific computing routines, which often involves various matrix computations, HPC experts are essential for achieving efficient execution of these computations on large-scale platforms. This process often involves utilizing complex parallel computing libraries tailored to specific matrix computation scenarios. However, the intricate programming procedure and the need for deep understanding in both application domains and HPC poses significant challenges to the widespread adoption of scientific computing. In this research, we observe that matrix computations can be transformed into equivalent graph representations, and that by utilizing graph processing engines, HPC experts can be freed from the burden of implementing efficient scientific computations. Based on this observation, we introduce a graph engine-based scientific computing (Graph for Science) paradigm, which provides a unified graph programming interface, enabling domain experts to promptly implement various types of matrix computations. The proposed paradigm leverages the underlying graph processing engine to achieve efficient execution, eliminating the needs for HPC expertise in programming large-scale scientific applications. Our results show that the graph engine-based scientific computing paradigm achieves performance comparable to the best-performing implementations based on existing parallel computing libraries and bespoke implementations. Importantly, the paradigm greatly simplifies the development of scientific computations on large-scale platforms, reducing the programming difficulty for scientists and facilitating broader adoption of scientific computing.			arxiv	['Zixiao Wang', 'Jin Zhao', 'Yuluo Guo', 'Hai Jin', 'Hui Yu', 'Zhiying Huang', 'Xuanhua Shi', 'Xiaofei Liao']	129.0
377	Distributed Computing for Localized and Multilayer Visualizations	Mark Burgin	2001-11-09 00:29:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0111022v1	The aim of this paper is to develop an approach to visualizations that benefits from distributed computing. Three schemes of process distribution are considered: parallel, pipeline, and expanding pipeline computations. Expanding pipeline structure synthesizes the advantages and traits of both parallel and pipeline computations. In expanding pipeline computing, a novel approach presented in this paper, a multiplicity of processes are concurrently developed in parallel and knotted processor pipelines. The theoretical foundations for expanding pipeline computing as a computational process are in the domains of alternating Turing machines, molecular computing, and E-machines. Expanding pipeline computing constitutes the development of the conventional pipeline architecture aimed at utilization of implicit parallel structures existing in algorithms. Such structures appear in various kinds of visualization. Image deriving and processing is a field that provides diverse opportunities for utilization of the advantages of distributed computing. The most relevant to the distributed architecture is stratified visualization with its two cases based on data localization and layer separation. Visualization is treated here as a special case of simulation. The conceptual approach to distributed computing developed in this paper have been applied to visualization in a computer support system, which is utilized in radiology and namely, for the noninvasive treatment of brain aneurysms.			arxiv	['Walter Karplus', 'Damon Liu']	130.0

For all but the ""embarrassingly parallel"" problems, the performance depends upon the level of granularity that can be achieved on the computer platform. Our computational particle physics applications require machines that can support a wide range of granularities, but in general, compute-intensive state-of-the-art projects will require finely grained distributions. Of the different types of machines available for the task, we consider cluster computers. The use of clusters of commodity computers in high performance computing has many advantages including the raw price/performance ratio and the flexibility of machine configuration and upgrade. Here we focus on what is usually considered the weak point of cluster technology; the scaling behaviour when faced with a numerically intensive parallel computation. To this end we examine the scaling of our own applications from numerical quantum field theory on a cluster and infer conclusions about the more general case."			arxiv	['N. Eicker', 'Th.

379	On the computational capabilities of physical systems part I: the impossibility of infallible computation	David H. Wolpert	2000-05-23 00:51:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0005058v1	In this first of two papers, strong limits on the accuracy of physical computation are established. First it is proven that there cannot be a physical computer C to which one can pose any and all computational tasks concerning the physical universe. Next it is proven that no physical computer C can correctly carry out any computational task in the subset of such tasks that can be posed to C. As a particular example, this means that there cannot be a physical computer that can, for any physical system external to that computer, take the specification of that external system's state as input and then correctly predict its future state before that future state actually occurs. The results also mean that there cannot exist an infallible, general-purpose observation apparatus, and that there cannot be an infallible, general-purpose control apparatus. These results do not rely on systems that are infinite, and/or non-classical, and/or obey chaotic dynamics. They also hold even if one uses an infinitely fast, infinitely dense computer, with computational powers greater than that of a Turing Machine.			arxiv	[]	132.0
380	Beyond Quantum Computation and Towards Quantum Field Computation	A. C. Manoharan	2003-04-19 16:00:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304136v1	Because the subject of relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) contains all of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, we expect quantum field computation to contain (non-relativistic) quantum computation. Although we do not yet have a quantum theory of the gravitational field, and are far from a practical implementation of a quantum field computer, some pieces of the puzzle (without gravity) are now available. We consider a general model for computation with quantum field theory, and obtain some results for relativistic quantum computation. Moreover, it is possible to see new connections between principal models of computation, namely, computation over the continuum and computation over the integers (Turing computation). Thus we identify a basic problem in QFT, namely Wightman's computation problem for domains of holomorphy, which we call WHOLO. Inspired by the same analytic functions which are central to the famous CPT theorem of QFT, it is possible to obtain a computational complexity structure for QFT and shed new light on certain complexity classes for this problem WHOLO.			arxiv	[]	133.0
381	Two Remarkable Computational Competencies of the Simple Genetic Algorithm	Keki M. Burjorjee	2008-10-19 01:08:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3357v2	Since the inception of genetic algorithmics the identification of computational efficiencies of the simple genetic algorithm (SGA) has been an important goal. In this paper we distinguish between a computational competency of the SGA--an efficient, but narrow computational ability--and a computational proficiency of the SGA--a computational ability that is both efficient and broad. Till date, attempts to deduce a computational proficiency of the SGA have been unsuccessful. It may, however, be possible to inductively infer a computational proficiency of the SGA from a set of related computational competencies that have been deduced. With this in mind we deduce two computational competencies of the SGA. These competencies, when considered together, point toward a remarkable computational proficiency of the SGA. This proficiency is pertinent to a general problem that is closely related to a well-known statistical problem at the cutting edge of computational genetics.			arxiv	[]	134.0

We work in a general framework (computable metric spaces, computable measures and functions) where this problem can be posed precisely. We consider invariant measures as fixed points of the transfer operator and give general conditions under which the transfer operator is (sufficiently) computable. In this case, a general result ensures the computability of isolated fixed points and hence invariant measures (in given classes of ""regular"" measures). This implies the computability of many SRB measures. On the other hand, not all computable dynamical systems have a computable invariant measure. We exhibit two interesting examples of computable dynamics, one having an SRB measure which is not computable and another having no computable invariant measure at all, showing some subtlety in this kind of problems."			arxiv	['Mathieu Hoyrup', 'Cristobal Rojas']	135.0

Various research challenges relating to the following topics are discussed: the organizational changes brought about by cloud computing; the economic and organizational implications of its utility billing model; the security, legal and privacy issues that cloud computing raises. It is important to highlight these research challenges because cloud computing is not simply about a technological improvement of data centers but a fundamental change in how IT is provisioned and used.

Jockusch Jr.	2010-10-25 18:02:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.5212v1	Generic computability has been studied in group theory and we now study it in the context of classical computability theory. A set A of natural numbers is generically computable if there is a partial computable function f whose domain has density 1 and which agrees with the characteristic function of A on its domain. A set A is coarsely computable if there is a computable set C such that the symmetric difference of A and C has density 0. We prove that there is a c.e. set which is generically computable but not coarsely computable and vice versa. We show that every nonzero Turing degree contains a set which is not coarsely computable. We prove that there is a c.e. set of density 1 which has no computable subset of density 1. As a corollary, there is a generically computable set A such that no generic algorithm for A has computable domain. We define a general notion of generic reducibility in the spirt of Turing reducibility and show that there is a natural order-preserving embedding of the Turing degrees into the generic degrees which is not surjective.			arxiv	['Paul E.

385	Experimental verification of quantum computations	Stefanie Barz	2013-08-30 20:00:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0005v1	Quantum computers are expected to offer substantial speedups over their classical counterparts and to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers. Beyond such practical significance, the concept of quantum computation opens up new fundamental questions, among them the issue whether or not quantum computations can be certified by entities that are inherently unable to compute the results themselves. Here we present the first experimental verification of quantum computations. We show, in theory and in experiment, how a verifier with minimal quantum resources can test a significantly more powerful quantum computer. The new verification protocol introduced in this work utilizes the framework of blind quantum computing and is independent of the experimental quantum-computation platform used. In our scheme, the verifier is only required to generate single qubits and transmit them to the quantum computer. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol using four photonic qubits and show how the verifier can test the computer's ability to perform measurement-based quantum computations.			arxiv	['Joseph F.

Today cloud computing is used in both industrial field and academic field. Cloud facilitates its users by providing virtual resources via internet. As the field of cloud computing is spreading the new techniques are developing. This increase in cloud computing environment also increases security challenges for cloud developers.

Cloud delivers computing as a utility as it is available to the cloud consumers on demand. It is a simple pay-per-use consumer-provider service model. It contains large number of shared resources. So Resource Management is always a major issue in cloud computing like any other computing paradigm. Due to the availability of finite resources it is very challenging for cloud providers to provide all the requested resources. From the cloud providers perspective cloud resources must be allocated in a fair and efficient manner. Research Survey is not available from the perspective of resource management as a process in cloud computing. So this research paper provides a detailed sequential view / steps on resource management in cloud computing. Firstly this research paper classifies various resources in cloud computing. It also gives taxonomy on resource management in cloud computing through which one can do further research.

This model of computation is a natural generalization of several well-studied notions of computation, including ordinary Turing machines, cellular automata, and parallel graph dynamical systems. We analyze the power of computations that can take place in this model, both in terms of the degrees of computability of the functions that can be computed, and the time and space resources needed to carry out these computations. We further show that properties of the underlying graph have significant consequences for the power of computation thereby obtained. In particular, we show that every arithmetically definable set can be computed by a graph Turing machine in constant time, and that every computably enumerable Turing degree can be computed in constant time and linear space by a graph Turing machine whose underlying graph has finite degree.			arxiv	['Cameron Freer']	142.0

The computing resource allocation solution needs to be carefully designed to guarantee the computing resource efficiency of MEC networks. Based on the potential game theory, a computing resource allocation solution is proposed to reduce energy consumption and improve computing resource efficiency in MEC networks. The computing resource allocation solution includes two parts: the first part is the power control scheme based on the potential game theory and the second part is the computing resource allocation scheme based on linear programming. The power control scheme is to find a set of the transmission powers of base stations (BSs) that maximizes the potential function of MEC networks. The computing resource allocation scheme is to maximize the average computing resource allocation coefficient of the MEC networks based on the results of the power control scheme. Compared with traditional solutions, simulation results indicate the computing resource utilization and energy efficiency of the proposed computing resource allocation solution are significantly improved.			arxiv	['Haoming Jia', 'Jiaqi Chen', 'Xiaohu Ge', 'Yonghui Li', 'Lin Tian', 'Jinglin Shi']	143.0

Fog provides important points of improved abilities, strong security controls, and processes, establish data transmission capabilities carefully and in a flexible manner. This paper gives an overview of the connections and attributes for both Fog computing and cloud varies by outline, preparation, directions, and strategies for associations and clients. This also explains how Fog computing is flexible and provide better service for data processing by overwhelming low network bandwidth instead of moving whole data to the cloud platform.			arxiv	[]	144.0

Despite such a salient feature, many design challenges and opportunities remain. In this paper, we focus on practical computing systems with heterogeneous computing resources, and design a novel CDC approach, called batch-processing based coded computing (BPCC), which exploits the fact that every computing node can obtain some coded results before it completes the whole task. To this end, we first describe the main idea of the BPCC framework, and then formulate an optimization problem for BPCC to minimize the task completion time by configuring the computation load. Through formal theoretical analyses, extensive simulation studies, and comprehensive real experiments on the Amazon EC2 computing clusters, we demonstrate promising performance of the proposed BPCC scheme, in terms of high computational efficiency and robustness to uncertain disturbances.			arxiv	['Junfei Xie', 'Kejie Lu', 'Yan Wan', 'Shengli Fu']	145.0

We first obtain an achievable communication load for any given computation load and any given function assignment at each node. The proposed file allocation strategy has two steps: first, the input files are partitioned into disjoint batches, each with possibly different size and computed by a distinct node; then, each node computes additional files from its non-computed files according to its redundant computation capability. In the Shuffle phase, coded multicasting opportunities are exploited thanks to the repetitive file allocation among different nodes. Based on this scheme, we further propose the computation-aware and the shuffle-aware function assignments. We prove that, by using proper function assignments, our achievable communication load for any given computation load is within a constant multiplicative gap to the optimum in an equivalent homogeneous system with the same average computation load. Numerical results show that our scheme with shuffle-aware function assignment achieves better computation-communication tradeoff than existing works in some cases.			arxiv	['Meixia Tao']	146.0

Odden	2019-10-08 10:18:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03316v2	Computation is becoming an increasingly important part of physics education. However, there are currently few theories of learning that can be used to help explain and predict the unique challenges and affordances associated with computation in physics. In this study, we adapt the existing theory of computational literacy, which posits that computational learning can be divided into material, cognitive, and social aspects, to the context of undergraduate physics. Based on an exploratory study of undergraduate physics computational literacy, using a newly-developed teaching tool known as a computational essay, we have identified a variety of student practices, knowledge, and beliefs across these three aspects of computational literacy. We illustrate these categories with data collected from students who engaged in an initial implementation of computational essays in an introductory electricity and magnetism class. We conclude by arguing that this framework can be used to theoretically diagnose student difficulties with computation, distinguish educational approaches that focus on material vs. cognitive aspects of computational literacy, and highlight the benefits and limitations of open-ended projects like computational essays to student learning.			arxiv	['Elise Lockwood', 'Marcos D.

Though services computing has greatly boosted the productivity of developers, it is faced with three main challenges: privacy and security risks, information silo, and pricing mechanisms and incentives. The recent advances of blockchain bring opportunities to address the challenges of services computing due to its build-in encryption as well as digital signature schemes, decentralization feature, and intrinsic incentive mechanisms. In this paper, we present a survey to investigate the integration of blockchain with services computing. The integration of blockchain with services computing mainly exhibits merits in two aspects: i) blockchain can potentially address key challenges of services computing and ii) services computing can also promote blockchain development. In particular, we categorize the current literature of services computing based on blockchain into five types: services creation, services discovery, services recommendation, services composition, and services arbitration. Moreover, we generalize Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) architecture and summarize the representative BaaS platforms. In addition, we also outline open issues of blockchain-based services computing and BaaS.			arxiv	['Zibin Zheng', 'Hong-Ning Dai']	148.0

Aly	2021-05-04 18:58:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01707v1	With parallel and distributed computing (PDC) now wide-spread, modern computing programs must incorporate PDC within the curriculum. ACM and IEEE Computer Society's Computer Science curricular guidelines have recommended exposure to PDC concepts since 2013. More recently, a variety of initiatives have made PDC curricular content, lectures, and labs freely available for undergraduate computer science programs. Despite these efforts, progress in ensuring computer science students graduate with sufficient PDC exposure has been uneven. This paper discusses the impact of ABET's revised criteria that have required exposure to PDC to achieve accreditation for computer science programs since 2018. The authors reviewed 20 top ABET-accredited computer science programs and analyzed how they covered the required PDC components in their curricula.

397	On the Arithmetic Complexity of the Bandwidth of Bandlimited Signals	Holger Boche	2022-02-04 02:10:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11695v1	The bandwidth of a signal is an important physical property that is of relevance in many signal- and information-theoretic applications. In this paper we study questions related to the computability of the bandwidth of computable bandlimited signals. To this end we employ the concept of Turing computability, which exactly describes what is theoretically feasible and can be computed on a digital computer. Recently, it has been shown that there exist computable bandlimited signals with finite energy, the actual bandwidth of which is not a computable number, and hence cannot be computed on a digital computer. In this work, we consider the most general class of band-limited signals, together with different computable representations thereof. Among other things, our analysis includes a characterization of the arithmetic complexity of the bandwidth of such signals and yields a negative answer to the question of whether it is at least possible to compute non-trivial upper or lower bounds for the bandwidth of a bandlimited signal. Furthermore, we relate the problem of bandwidth computation to the theory of oracle machines. In particular, we consider halting and totality oracles, which belong to the most frequently investigated oracle machines in the theory of computation.			arxiv	['Yannik N. Böck', 'Ullrich J.

398	Optimal Stochastic Resource Allocation for Distributed Quantum Computing	Napat Ngoenriang	2022-09-16 02:37:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02886v1	With the advent of interconnected quantum computers, i.e., distributed quantum computing (DQC), multiple quantum computers can now collaborate via quantum networks to perform massively complex computational tasks. However, DQC faces problems sharing quantum information because it cannot be cloned or duplicated between quantum computers. Thanks to advanced quantum mechanics, quantum computers can teleport quantum information across quantum networks. However, challenges to utilizing efficiently quantum resources, e.g., quantum computers and quantum channels, arise in DQC due to their capabilities and properties, such as uncertain qubit fidelity and quantum channel noise. In this paper, we propose a resource allocation scheme for DQC based on stochastic programming to minimize the total deployment cost for quantum resources. Essentially, the two-stage stochastic programming model is formulated to handle the uncertainty of quantum computing demands, computing power, and fidelity in quantum networks. The performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and ability of the proposed scheme to balance the utilization of quantum computers and on-demand quantum computers while minimizing the overall cost of provisioning under uncertainty.			arxiv	['Minrui Xu', 'Sucha Supittayapornpong', 'Dusit Niyato', 'Han Yu', 'Xuemin', 'Shen']	151.0
399	Quantum Computing Enhanced Distance-Minimizing Data-Driven Computational Mechanics	Yongchun Xu	2023-06-14 07:22:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08305v1	The distance-minimizing data-driven computational mechanics has great potential in engineering applications by eliminating material modeling error and uncertainty. In this computational framework, the solution-seeking procedure relies on minimizing the distance between the constitutive database and the conservation law. However, the distance calculation is time-consuming and often takes up most of the computational time in the case of a huge database. In this paper, we show how to use quantum computing to enhance data-driven computational mechanics by exponentially reducing the computational complexity of distance calculation. The proposed method is not only validated on the quantum computer simulator Qiskit, but also on the real quantum computer from OriginQ. We believe that this work represents a promising step towards integrating quantum computing into data-driven computational mechanics.			arxiv	['Jie Yang', 'Zengtao Kuang', 'Qun Huang', 'Wei Huang', 'Heng Hu']	152.0
400	Solving Partial Differential Equations with Monte Carlo / Random Walk on an Analog-Digital Hybrid Computer	Dirk Killat	2023-09-11 16:24:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05598v1	Current digital computers are about to hit basic physical boundaries with respect to integration density, clock frequencies, and particularly energy consumption. This requires the application of new computing paradigms, such as quantum and analog computing in the near future. Although neither quantum nor analog computer are general purpose computers they will play an important role as co-processors to offload certain classes of compute intensive tasks from classic digital computers, thereby not only reducing run time but also and foremost power consumption. In this work, we describe a random walk approach to the solution of certain types of partial differential equations which is well suited for combinations of digital and analog computers (hybrid computers). The experiments were performed on an Analog Paradigm Model-1 analog computer attached to a digital computer by means of a hybrid interface. At the end we give some estimates of speedups and power consumption obtainable by using future analog computers on chip.			arxiv	['Sven Köppel', 'Bernd Ulmann', 'Lucas Wetzel']	153.0
401	Average value estimation in nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation	Guo-Fu Xu	2023-11-09 02:54:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05110v1	Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation has been attracting continuous attention since it was proposed. Until now, various schemes of nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation have been developed and many of them have been experimentally demonstrated. It is known that at the end of a computation, one usually needs to estimate the average value of an observable. However, computation errors severely disturb the final state of a computation, causing erroneous average value estimation. Thus for nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation, an important topic is to investigate how to better give the average value of an observable under the condition of computation errors. While the above topic is important, the previous works in the field of nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation pay woefully inadequate attention to it. In this paper, we show that rescaling the measurement results can better give the average value of an observable in nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation when computation errors are considered. Particularly, we show that by rescaling the measurement results, $56.25\%$ of the computation errors can be reduced when using depolarizing noise model, a widely adopted noise model in quantum computation community, to analyse the benefit of our method.			arxiv	['P.

We compute conformal structures in the following way: first compute homology bases from simplicial complex structures, then construct dual cohomology bases and diffuse them to harmonic 1-forms. Next, we construct bases of holomorphic differentials. We then obtain period matrices by integrating holomorphic differentials along homology bases. We also study the global conformal mapping between genus zero surfaces and spheres, and between general meshes and planes. Our method of computing conformal structures can be applied to tackle fundamental problems in computer aid design and computer graphics, such as geometry classification and identification, and surface global parametrization.			arxiv	['Shing-Tung Yau']	155.0

Distributive categories have been proposed as a foundational tool for Computer Science in the last years, starting from the papers of R.F.C. Walters. We shall focus on two major topics: distributive computability, i.e., a generalized theory of computability based on distributive categories, and the Imp(G) language, which is a language based on the syntax of distributive categories. The link between the former and the latter is that the functions computed by Imp(G) programs are exactly the distributively computable functions.			arxiv	[]	156.0

A quantum routine for computing a generalized Kronecker product is given. Applications include re-development of the networks for computing the Walsh-Hadamard and the quantum Fourier transform. New networks for two wavelet transforms are given. Quantum computation of Fourier transforms for non-Abelian groups is defined. A slightly relaxed definition is shown to simplify the analysis and the networks that computes the transforms. Efficient networks for computing such transforms for a class of metacyclic groups are introduced. A novel network for computing a Fourier transform for a group used in quantum error-correction is also given.			arxiv	[]	157.0

A quantum computer threatens the security of public key encryption systems because these systems rely on the fact that prime factorization is computationally difficult. Errors limit the effectiveness of quantum computers. Because of the exponential nature of quantum com puters, simulating the effect of errors on them requires a vast amount of processing and memory resources. In this paper we describe a parallel simulator which accesses the feasibility of quantum computers. We also derive and validate an analytical model of execution time for the simulator, which shows that parallel quantum computer simulation is very scalable.			arxiv	['Alvin M. Despain']	158.0

Several embodiments of the generic concept are discussed, and the close connection to Weihrauch reducibility is pointed out. As a novel concept, computability with random advice is studied; which corresponds to correct solutions being guessable with positive probability. In the framework of computation with advice, it is possible to define computational complexity for certain concepts of hypercomputation. Finally, some examples are given which illuminate the interplay of uniform and non-uniform techniques in order to investigate both computability with advice and the Weihrauch lattice.			arxiv	['Arno Pauly']	164.0

Different access to computational resources may result in a kind of economic asymmetry analogous to information asymmetry. In order to represent strategic computational choices within a game theoretic framework, we propose a new game specification, Strategic Bayesian Networks (SBN). In an SBN, random variables are represented as nodes in a graph, with edges indicating probabilistic dependence. For some nodes, players can choose conditional probability distributions as a strategic choice. Using SBN, we present two games that demonstrate computational asymmetry. These games are symmetric except for the computational limitations of the actors. We show that the better computationally endowed player receives greater payoff.			arxiv	['John Chuang']	167.0

Presenting a computable object via any program for it, provides at least as much information as presenting the object itself, written on an infinite tape. What additional information do programs provide? We characterize this additional information to be any upper bound on the Kolmogorov complexity of the object. Hence we identify the exact relationship between Markov-computability and Type-2-computability. We then use this relationship to obtain several results characterizing the computational and topological structure of Markov-semidecidable sets.			arxiv	['Cristobal Rojas']	171.0

Based on the strict reversibility of the laws of microphysics, Landauer (1961), Bennett (1973), Priese (1976), Fredkin and Toffoli (1982), Feynman (1985) and others envisioned a reversible computer that cannot allow any ambiguity in backward steps of a calculation. It is this backward capacity that makes reversible computing radically different from ordinary, irreversible computing. The proposal aims at a higher kind of computer that would give the actual output of a computation together with the original input, with the absence of a minimum energy requirement. Hence, information retrievability and energy efficiency due to diminished heat dissipation are the exquisite tasks of quantum computer technology.			arxiv	[]	185.0

436	BQP is not in NP	Jonah Librande	2022-09-19 23:17:57	http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10398v1	Quantum computers are widely believed have an advantage over classical computers, and some have even published some empirical evidence that this is the case. However, these publications do not include a rigorous proof of this advantage, which would have to minimally state that the class of problems decidable by a quantum computer in polynomial time, BQP, contains problems that are not in the class of problems decidable by a classical computer with similar time bounds, P. Here, I provide the proof of a stronger result that implies this result: BQP contains problems that lie beyond the much larger classical computing class NP. This proves that quantum computation is able to efficiently solve problems which are far beyond the capabilities of classical computers.			arxiv	[]	189.0

Computation and communication delays are assumed to be random, and redundant computations are assigned to workers in order to tolerate stragglers. We consider sequential computation of tasks assigned to a worker, while the result of each computation is sent to the master right after its completion. Each computation round, which can model an iteration of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, is completed once the master receives k distinct computations, referred to as the computation target. Our goal is to characterize the average completion time as a function of the computation load, which denotes the portion of the dataset available at each worker, and the computation target. We propose two computation scheduling schemes that specify the tasks assigned to each worker, as well as their computation schedule, i.e., the order of execution. Assuming a general statistical model for computation and communication delays, we derive the average completion time of the proposed schemes. We also establish a lower bound on the minimum average completion time by assuming prior knowledge of the random delays. Experimental results carried out on Amazon EC2 cluster show a significant reduction in the average completion time over existing coded and uncoded computing schemes. It is also shown numerically that the gap between the proposed scheme and the lower bound is relatively small, confirming the efficiency of the proposed scheduling design.			arxiv	['Deniz Gunduz']	210.0

The solution of the computational problem involves identifying a target objective function value that is the subject to be reached. A bottleneck in a gate-model quantum computer is the requirement of several rounds of quantum state preparations, high-cost run sequences, and multiple rounds of measurements to determine a target (optimal) state of the quantum computer that achieves the target objective function value. Here, we define a method for optimal quantum state determination and computational path evaluation for gate-model quantum computers. We prove a state determination method that finds a target system state for a quantum computer at a given target objective function value. The computational pathway evaluation procedure sets the connectivity of the objective function in the target system state on a fixed hardware architecture of the quantum computer. The proposed solution evolves the target system state without requiring the preparation of intermediate states between the initial and target states of the quantum computer. Our method avoids high-cost system state preparations and expensive running procedures and measurement apparatuses in gate-model quantum computers. The results are convenient for gate-model quantum computations and the near-term quantum devices of the quantum Internet.			arxiv	[]	216.0

464	Revisiting thermodynamics in computation and information theory	Pritam Chattopadhyay	2021-02-19 15:24:45	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09981v1	One of the primary motivations of the research in the field of computation is to optimize the cost of computation. The major ingredient that a computer needs is the energy to run a process, i.e., the thermodynamic cost. The analysis of the thermodynamic cost of computation is one of the prime focuses of research. It started back since the seminal work of Landauer where it was commented that the computer spends kB T ln2 amount of energy to erase a bit of information (here T is the temperature of the system and kB represents the Boltzmann's constant). The advancement of statistical mechanics has provided us the necessary tool to understand and analyze the thermodynamic cost for the complicated processes that exist in nature, even the computation of modern computers. The advancement of physics has helped us to understand the connection of the statistical mechanics (the thermodynamics cost) with computation. Another important factor that remains a matter of concern in the field of computer science is the error correction of the error that occurs while transmitting the information through a communication channel. Here in this article, we have reviewed the progress of the thermodynamics of computation starting from Landauer's principle to the latest model, which simulates the modern complex computation mechanism. After exploring the salient parts of computation in computer science theory and information theory, we have reviewed the thermodynamic cost of computation and error correction. We have also discussed about the alternative computation models that have been proposed with thermodynamically cost-efficient.			arxiv	['Goutam Paul']	218.0

Computer architectures are evolving to accommodate the computing of large data better. Protecting the computation of sensitive data is also an imperative yet challenging objective; processor-supported secure enclaves serve as the key element in confidential computing in the cloud. However, side-channel attacks are threatening their security boundaries. The current processor architectures consume a considerable portion of its cycles in moving data. Near data computation is a promising approach that minimizes redundant data movement by placing computation inside storage. In this paper, we present a novel design for Processing-In-Memory (PIM) as a data-intensive workload accelerator for confidential computing. Based on our observation that moving computation closer to memory can achieve efficiency of computation and confidentiality of the processed information simultaneously, we study the advantages of confidential computing \emph{inside} memory. We then explain our security model and programming model developed for PIM-based computation offloading. We construct our findings into a software-hardware co-design, which we call PIM-Enclave. Our design illustrates the advantages of PIM-based confidential computing acceleration. Our evaluation shows PIM-Enclave can provide a side-channel resistant secure computation offloading and run data-intensive applications with negligible performance overhead compared to baseline PIM model.			arxiv	['Hojoon Lee']	220.0

Such hybrid models, in combination with the by now inherently distributed nature of the data on which the models `feed' suggest a distributed computing model, where parts of the multi-scale multi-science model are executed on the most suitable computing environment, and/or where the computations are carried out close to the required data (i.e. bring the computations to the data instead of the other way around). We presents an estimate for the compute requirements to simulate the Galaxy as a typical example of a multi-scale multi-physics application, requiring distributed Petaflop/s computational power.			arxiv	['S.

To this end, we equip the space of Lp-computable functions (computable Lebesgue integrable functions) with a size notion, by introducing Lp-computable Baire categories. We show that Lp-computable Baire categories satisfy the following three basic properties. Singleton sets {f} (where f is Lp-computable) are meager, suitable infinite unions of meager sets are meager, and the whole space of Lp-computable functions is not meager. We give an alternative characterization of meager sets via Banach Mazur games. We study the convergence of Fourier series for Lp-computable functions and show that whereas for every p>1, the Fourier series of every Lp-computable function f converges to f in the Lp norm, the set of L1-computable functions whose Fourier series does not diverge almost everywhere is meager.			arxiv	[]	233.0

Though the round-off error is as small as in the seventh decimal place (single precision) in the beginning, it can enter the mainstream computation within 50 iterations in iterative computations, such as that used in numerical integration schemes, for example, the commonly used fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Growth of round-off error in recursive vis-a-vis iterative computing is described in the text. In this paper several computational experiments are presented to demonstrate the rapid growth of round-off error in iterative computations.			arxiv	[]	234.0
476	On the computational capabilities of physical systems part II: relationship with conventional computer science	David H. Wolpert	2000-05-23 00:58:41	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0005059v1	In the first of this pair of papers, it was proven that that no physical computer can correctly carry out all computational tasks that can be posed to it. The generality of this result follows from its use of a novel definition of computation, ``physical computation''. This second paper of the pair elaborates the mathematical structure and impossibility results associated with physical computation. Analogues of Chomsky hierarcy results concerning universal Turing Machines and the Halting theorem are derived, as are results concerning the (im)possibility of certain kinds of error-correcting codes. In addition, an analogue of algorithmic information complexity, ``prediction complexity'', is elaborated. A task-independent bound is derived on how much the prediction complexity of a computational task can differ for two different universal physical computers used to solve that task, a bound similar to the ``encoding'' bound governing how much the algorithm information complexity of a Turing machine calculation can differ for two universal Turing machines. Finally, it is proven that either the Hamiltonian of our universe proscribes a certain type of computation, or prediction complexity is unique (unlike algorithmic information complexity).			arxiv	[]	235.0

479	Fault-tolerant quantum computation	Peter W. Shor	1996-05-13 14:29:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9605011v2	Recently, it was realized that use of the properties of quantum mechanics might speed up certain computations dramatically. Interest in quantum computation has since been growing. One of the main difficulties of realizing quantum computation is that decoherence tends to destroy the information in a superposition of states in a quantum computer, thus making long computations impossible. A futher difficulty is that inaccuracies in quantum state transformations throughout the computation accumulate, rendering the output of long computations unreliable. It was previously known that a quantum circuit with t gates could tolerate O(1/t) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate. We show, for any quantum computation with t gates, how to build a polynomial size quantum circuit that can tolerate O(1/(log t)^c) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate, for some constant c. We do this by showing how to compute using quantum error correcting codes. These codes were previously known to provide resistance to errors while storing and transmitting quantum data.			arxiv	[]	238.0

483	Computation in Classical Mechanics	Todd Timberlake	2007-08-18 17:44:41	http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.2498v1	There is a growing consensus that physics majors need to learn computational skills, but many departments are still devoid of computation in their physics curriculum. Some departments may lack the resources or commitment to create a dedicated course or program in computational physics. One way around this difficulty is to include computation in a standard upper-level physics course. An intermediate classical mechanics course is particularly well suited for including computation. We discuss the ways we have used computation in our classical mechanics courses, focusing on how computational work can improve students' understanding of physics as well as their computational skills. We present examples of computational problems that serve these two purposes. In addition, we provide information about resources for instructors who would like to include computation in their courses.			arxiv	['Javier E. Hasbun']	242.0

Barry Cooper	2009-11-15 03:35:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.2829v1	The special theme of DCM 2009, co-located with ICALP 2009, concerned Computational Models From Nature, with a particular emphasis on computational models derived from physics and biology. The intention was to bring together different approaches - in a community with a strong foundational background as proffered by the ICALP attendees - to create inspirational cross-boundary exchanges, and to lead to innovative further research. Specifically DCM 2009 sought contributions in quantum computation and information, probabilistic models, chemical, biological and bio-inspired ones, including spatial models, growth models and models of self-assembly. Contributions putting to the test logical or algorithmic aspects of computing (e.g., continuous computing with dynamical systems, or solid state computing models) were also very much welcomed.			arxiv	['Vincent Danos']	244.0
485	The Computable Universe Hypothesis	Matthew P. Szudzik	2010-03-27 18:28:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5831v6	When can a model of a physical system be regarded as computable? We provide the definition of a computable physical model to answer this question. The connection between our definition and Kreisel's notion of a mechanistic theory is discussed, and several examples of computable physical models are given, including models which feature discrete motion, a model which features non-discrete continuous motion, and probabilistic models such as radioactive decay. We show how computable physical models on effective topological spaces can be formulated using the theory of type-two effectivity (TTE). Various common operations on computable physical models are described, such as the operation of coarse-graining and the formation of statistical ensembles. The definition of a computable physical model also allows for a precise formalization of the computable universe hypothesis--the claim that all the laws of physics are computable.			arxiv	[]	245.0
486	Experimental Demonstration of Blind Quantum Computing	Stefanie Barz	2011-10-06 20:00:14	http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.1381v1	Quantum computers, besides offering substantial computational speedups, are also expected to provide the possibility of preserving the privacy of a computation. Here we show the first such experimental demonstration of blind quantum computation where the input, computation, and output all remain unknown to the computer. We exploit the conceptual framework of measurement-based quantum computation that enables a client to delegate a computation to a quantum server. We demonstrate various blind delegated computations, including one- and two-qubit gates and the Deutsch and Grover algorithms. Remarkably, the client only needs to be able to prepare and transmit individual photonic qubits. Our demonstration is crucial for future unconditionally secure quantum cloud computing and might become a key ingredient for real-life applications, especially when considering the challenges of making powerful quantum computers widely available.			arxiv	['Elham Kashefi', 'Anne Broadbent', 'Joseph F.

487	Stone Age Distributed Computing	Yuval Emek	2012-02-06 16:20:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1186v2	"The traditional models of distributed computing focus mainly on networks of computer-like devices that can exchange large messages with their neighbors and perform arbitrary local computations. Recently, there is a trend to apply distributed computing methods to networks of sub-microprocessor devices, e.g., biological cellular networks or networks of nano-devices. However, the suitability of the traditional distributed computing models to these types of networks is questionable: do tiny bio/nano nodes ""compute"" and/or ""communicate"" essentially the same as a computer? In this paper, we introduce a new model that depicts a network of randomized finite state machines operating in an asynchronous environment. Although the computation and communication capabilities of each individual device in the new model are, by design, much weaker than those of a computer, we show that some of the most important and extensively studied distributed computing problems can still be solved efficiently."			arxiv	['Jasmin Smula', 'Roger Wattenhofer']	249.0
488	Quantum Computation and Quantum Information	Yazhen Wang	2012-10-02 11:47:37	http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0736v1	Quantum computation and quantum information are of great current interest in computer science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will likely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication, computation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally stochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum algorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo techniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum computation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to revolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be generated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine random numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up median evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This paper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and quantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much faster than the available classic algorithms. We provide a statistical framework for the analysis of quantum algorithms and quantum simulation.			arxiv	[]	250.0

We show that computably compact computable metric spaces admit representations of their compact subsets in such a way that compact sets are essentially underspecified points. We can even ensure that a name of an $n$-element compact set contains $n$ occurrences of $\bot$. We undergo this study effectively and show that such a $\mathbb{T}^\omega$-representation is effectively obtained from structures of computably compact computable metric spaces. As an application, we prove some statements about the Weihrauch degree of closed choice for finite subsets of computably compact computable metric spaces. Along the way, we introduce the notion of a computable dyadic subbase, and prove that every computably compact computable metric space admits a proper computable dyadic subbase.			arxiv	['Hideki Tsuiki']	253.0
491	Space-Efficient Error Reduction for Unitary Quantum Computations	Bill Fefferman	2016-04-27 19:30:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08192v1	This paper develops general space-efficient methods for error reduction for unitary quantum computation. Consider a polynomial-time quantum computation with completeness $c$ and soundness $s$, either with or without a witness (corresponding to QMA and BQP, respectively). To convert this computation into a new computation with error at most $2^{-p}$, the most space-efficient method known requires extra workspace of ${O \bigl( p \log \frac{1}{c-s} \bigr)}$ qubits. This space requirement is too large for scenarios like logarithmic-space quantum computations. This paper presents error-reduction methods for unitary quantum computations (i.e., computations without intermediate measurements) that require extra workspace of just ${O \bigl( \log \frac{p}{c-s} \bigr)}$ qubits. This in particular gives the first methods of strong amplification for logarithmic-space unitary quantum computations with two-sided bounded error. This also leads to a number of consequences in complexity theory, such as the uselessness of quantum witnesses in bounded-error logarithmic-space unitary quantum computations, the PSPACE upper bound for QMA with exponentially-small completeness-soundness gap, and strong amplification for matchgate computations.			arxiv	['Hirotada Kobayashi', 'Cedric Yen-Yu Lin', 'Tomoyuki Morimae', 'Harumichi Nishimura']	254.0
492	Computation Diversity in Emerging Networking Paradigms	Kezhi Wang	2017-01-21 11:01:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06008v2	Nowadays, computation is playing an increasingly more important role in the future generation of computer and communication networks, as exemplified by the recent progress in software defined networking (SDN) for wired networks as well as cloud radio access networks (C-RAN) and mobile cloud computing (MCC) for wireless networks. This paper proposes a unified concept, i.e., computation diversity, to describe the impact and diverse forms of the computation resources on both wired and wireless communications. By linking the computation resources to the communication networks based on quality of service (QoS) requirements, we can show how computation resources influence the networks. Moreover, by analyzing the different functionalities of computation resources in SDN, C-RAN, and MCC, we can show diverse and flexible form that the computation resources present in different networks. The study of computation diversity can provide guidance to the future networks design, i.e., how to allocate the resources jointly between computation (e.g., CPU capacity) and communication (e.g., bandwidth), and thereby saving system energy and increase users' experiences.			arxiv	['Kun Yang', 'Hsiao-Hwa Chen', 'Lianming Zhang']	256.0
493	A Game-Semantic Model of Computation	Norihiro Yamada	2017-02-16 18:27:19	http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05073v3	The present paper introduces a novel notion of `(effective) computability', called viability, of strategies in game semantics in an intrinsic (i.e., without recourse to the standard Church-Turing computability), non-inductive and non-axiomatic manner, and shows, as a main technical achievement, that viable strategies are Turing complete. Consequently, we have given a mathematical foundation of computation in the same sense as Turing machines but beyond computation on natural numbers, e.g., higher-order computation, in a more abstract fashion. As immediate corollaries, some of the well-known theorems in computability theory such as the smn-theorem and the first recursion theorem are generalized. Notably, our game-semantic framework distinguishes `high-level' computational processes that operate directly on mathematical objects such as natural numbers (not on their symbolic representations) and their `symbolic implementations' that define their `computability', which sheds new light on the very concept of computation. This work is intended to be a stepping stone towards a new mathematical foundation of computation, intuitionistic logic and constructive mathematics.			arxiv	[]	257.0
494	Temporal correlation detection using computational phase-change memory	Abu Sebastian	2017-06-01 22:10:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00511v1	For decades, conventional computers based on the von Neumann architecture have performed computation by repeatedly transferring data between their processing and their memory units, which are physically separated. As computation becomes increasingly data-centric and as the scalability limits in terms of performance and power are being reached, alternative computing paradigms are searched for in which computation and storage are collocated. A fascinating new approach is that of computational memory where the physics of nanoscale memory devices are used to perform certain computational tasks within the memory unit in a non-von Neumann manner. Here we present a large-scale experimental demonstration using one million phase-change memory devices organized to perform a high-level computational primitive by exploiting the crystallization dynamics. Also presented is an application of such a computational memory to process real-world data-sets. The results show that this co-existence of computation and storage at the nanometer scale could be the enabler for new, ultra-dense, low power, and massively parallel computing systems.			arxiv	['Tomas Tuma', 'Nikolaos Papandreou', 'Manuel Le Gallo', 'Lukas Kull', 'Thomas Parnell', 'Evangelos Eleftheriou']	258.0

498	Using Machine Learning to reduce the energy wasted in Volunteer Computing Environments	A. Stephen McGough	2018-10-19 20:17:41	http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08675v1	High Throughput Computing (HTC) provides a convenient mechanism for running thousands of tasks. Many HTC systems exploit computers which are provisioned for other purposes by utilising their idle time - volunteer computing. This has great advantages as it gives access to vast quantities of computational power for little or no cost. The downside is that running tasks are sacrificed if the computer is needed for its primary use. Normally terminating the task which must be restarted on a different computer - leading to wasted energy and an increase in task completion time. We demonstrate, through the use of simulation, how we can reduce this wasted energy by targeting tasks at computers less likely to be needed for primary use, predicting this idle time through machine learning. By combining two machine learning approaches, namely Random Forest and MultiLayer Perceptron, we save 51.4% of the energy without significantly affecting the time to complete tasks.			arxiv	['Matthew Forshaw', 'John Brennan', 'Noura Al Moubayed', 'Stephen Bonner']	262.0

Lead by a reference architecture model for Edge Computing, current initiatives are analyzed by explorative content analysis. Providing two main contributions to the field, we present, first, how current initiatives are characterized, and second, a roadmap for sustainable Edge Computing relating three dimensions of sustainable development to four cross-concerns of Edge Computing. Findings show that most initiatives are internationally organized software development projects; important branches are currently telecom and industrial sectors; most addressed is the network virtualization layer. The roadmap reveals numerous chances and risks of Edge Computing related to sustainable development; such as the use of renewable energies, biases, new business models, increase and decrease of energy consumption, responsiveness, monitoring and traceability.			arxiv	['Alexander Willner', 'Ina Schieferdecker']	263.0

Before I describe the issue, let me list down my hardware details. Monitor: Acer SH242Y 23.8 inch FHD IPS OS: Windows 11 Pro Processor: i7-12700KF Motherboard: Asus PRIME z690-P WIFI D4 BIOS: recent 11/8/2023 So I initially bought this brand new monitor for a MSI laptop I was using without any issue. Thereafter I got a PC/desktop. The issue arose when I first connected it (via HDMI) to the PC. Monitor can be turned on and off with display (monitor's own options/settings interface) but it says no signal in respect to my PC. I know my PC started up properly and is working because firstly, my keyboard and mouse light up, I can hear the Windows start up sound and some notification sound. I had to do a few hard restart of the PC (via the restart button on the PC case) before the monitor finally had signal and I can use my computer without issue. I would be able to use the computer for as long as I want and the monitor display/signal never ever drop (tried leaving computer on for 3days). I can turn off and on the monitor and the display will still be there. I can restart the computer and there will still be signal. So it seems that as long as I get the signal, it stays, until at night when I shut down my computer and go to bed. And when I wake up in the morning, the issue would arise again. Sometimes I had to hard restart 1 time, sometimes 2-5 times, sometimes 1 hour + of sitting there and pressing the restart button on my PC. Today the issue got worst, after I updated my BIOS (hoping to solve the issue), woke up to the issue again, and this time 1.5 hour of hard restarting. Things I have tried which didn't work or improve the issue \- Updated BIOS to latest 08/2023 (note that this issue arose when I was on some 2021 BIOS) \- Bought a brand new HDMI cable \- Tried both motherboard and gpu HDMI port \- Opening up my PC to ensure GPU is tightly secured (not loose) I am extremely annoyed and confused by the inconsistency of the problem. Monitor doesn't seem to have issue because it can be turn on and off and has display, connection or signal to my PC doesn't drop once its working properly. I have not tried using a DP cable or connect my monitor to other devices because of this inconsistency (and also I do not have a DP cable or another device which I can HDMI connect to the monitor) I have tried googling but my issue seems to be unique I couldn't find anything. I really appreciate any input or advice. Do you guys think its an hardware or software issue? How would a cable or port issue explain the inconsistency of the issue?	2.0	t3_18sjsga	reddit

The two main concerns I have are: 1. Proper orientation of the computer. I've seen some people say they're fine standing, some say to take out the GPU, some say to prop up the GPU, and other people say to just lay the computer on its side. Given the amount of options, I have no idea which one is remotely the most optimal. 2. My second concern in temperature. I'm driving across the US which is absolutely freezing this time of year, especially during the night. The trip is going to take multiple days, in which time the car will be off overnight and most likely just as cold inside as it is outside. I've heard concerns about leaving PCs in near freezing/subfreezing temperatures. Are those valid concerns in this case? Literally any help, especially from those who have done this/something similar is greatly appreciated. My PC is pretty new and I'd hate for it to die as a result of something I did, or didn't do, during the drive.	6.0	t3_18rgsb7	reddit

I thought it could be interference as my mouse and controller disconnects with it but the headset works fine on my Xbox like I have mentioned previously. I have reset the pc as well and the issue did resolve it's self. I have also brought myself a new wireless headset (Logitech G733) and it still happens. **Computer:** Ryzen 5 5600G Asrock B550M PRO4 Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro SL 16GB Samsung 1TB 970 EVO PLUS RTX 3060Ti Windows 10 Home	1.0	t3_18r3nhz	reddit

I’m at wits ends here. Can’t play a shit ton of games. This is Steam btw. No error code shows up, I hit play, it says running for approx 7 seconds, then stops. Game never opens. I’ve tried verifying files, tried CPU Virtualization, tried fucking with BIOS, tried making a .bat file to override EOS setup, tried making two .bat files, tried optimizing virtual RAM, tried uninstalling and reinstalling both the game and the Anticheat, tried repairing the Anticheat in the file, tried joining discord servers and reaching out to people, all to no avail. So far, I’ve been able to deduce that it’s not an Antivirus issue, and it’s likely Windows 11 messing with it itself. In the service log for the Anticheat, it’s saying something about having no perms to open the game. Currently down that rabbithole, wanted to take a break to post this. For the game BattleBit Remastered, I’ve been able to run EasyAntiCheat on its own through the files and the game works, but it doesn’t work through steam. No other game has this fix. Please help!

I can restart my computer and the screen turns black on but the process repeats when i go to play any game. I believe hopefully it is at worst my power supply (500w) is not enough and therefore just stops working. Honestly im just hoping its not a faulty card as i only got it today and definitely can't get another. I should also mention i have quite a few for example: 1 sata to 2 sata cable adapters etc to power everything but the GPU is connected as close the the PSU as possible outside of these. The idea is i really dont want to be spending any more money on a better PSU unless really necessary. I have tried things like: * Reinstalling Drivers * Changing power plan I have tried alot other things but off the top of my head thats what i remember. Any recommendations would be great.

I wiped out the disk, tried to reinstall Windows, and it took like forever, so, well, I thought, that SSD #2 disk was probably bad. So I ordered another disk online and while I wait I decided to delete Linux (I have an other computer with it running, so I didn't need it that much) and install Windows on SSD #1. I did, and played the game for like 5 hours. Everything was going well. I shutted down the laptop for the night. And then, this morning, Windows won't boot. The boot option wasn't even there in the BIOS. And there was no data on the drive. I reinstalled Windows, and after the install it won't boot again. So, well, am I that unlucky or is there something I am missing? The game is Crusader Kings 3 (if it helps) and it just destroyed two SSDs in 24 hours. Would it be better to play that game on a HDD, even if it's slow? Or is it because I got cheap SSDs and it wouldn't have happened if I got better ones?

Long time beneficiary of tech subreddit wisdom, first time poster. I have spent the past few months fistfighting my laptop (Lenovo Thinkpad with Windows 10) and losing quite badly. I bought it used about a year and a half ago and worked very well until a few months ago, when the Wi-Fi abruptly stopped working sensibly. It works sporadically, and sometimes I'll even go several days without my laptop disconnecting from Wi-Fi every few minutes, but inevitably it backslides. When I run my network troubleshooter (the only thing that gets it to connect, albeit briefly), the most common issue it claims to resolve is that the default gateway is not available. This also sometimes results in abrupt bluescreening, with varying error messages (the one I've gotten the most consistently is Kernel Security Check Failure, though I've seen others every so often and the online fixes I've seen for these don't make a difference. Additionally, I haven't located or noted any security issues). This is definitely not a Wi-Fi or router issue, as it's been consistent across several state lines and doesn't affect any other devices. I suspect that this is a driver issue, but I have no idea how to fix it: I've tried updating and rolling back my drivers several times to no effect, and when I downloaded one of the programs suggested by the internet to help automatically update drivers, that didn't make much difference either. Function of non-WiFi-dependent aspects of my laptop were unaffected until recently, when the bottom taskbar would abruptly start freezing and become impossible to click on, slowing down and freezing any apps that I had open. This much completely baffles me, and I have no idea whether it's related to my recurring Wi-Fi issues. I am not especially tech savvy and completely at a loss, so any help at all would be an absolute godsend.	3.0	t3_18qbhgw	reddit

Unknown	2023-12-25 03:46:56	https://www.reddit.com/r/computer/comments/18qaofc/advice_to_upgrade_or_choose_your_setup/	Number 1, you don’t wanna buy a black mouse pad because it more likely to get dirty than white ones. Number 2, you don’t wanna get keyboards like magegee and those types of keyboards. Instead you wanna get a Royal Kludge keyboard of you have a limited budget. Number 3, always try to look for a gaming mouse with side buttons on it to improve your gameplay. Lastly Number 4, try getting a 27” monitor instead of a 24 one. That way it has the best ratio of pixels to the hz to your monitor. You don’t wanna get a too small or too big of a monitor. To also add on always get a speaker built in monitor instead of throwing a 20 bill on some usb speakers that can probably break in a year.	2.0	t3_18qaofc	reddit

The power supply, fans and cooler, ARGB... turn on, but without BOOT and no video appears on the monitor. I've already checked the connectors, they're all ok. The CPU is possibly not, as I was careful when installing and placing the thermal paste.

602	HP Elitedesk G9 SFF i5-12500 and Intel ARC A380 RESIZABLE BAR question	Unknown	2023-12-24 08:19:38	https://www.reddit.com/r/computer/comments/18pqzm7/hp_elitedesk_g9_sff_i512500_and_intel_arc_a380/	Hi! I have an HP Elite (Elitedesk) 600 G9 SFF with an Intel Core i5-12500 processor, Q670 chipset. The computer has a 250W power supply and does not power the dedicated graphics system. I would like to install a graphics card in it so that I can play simple games from time to time. I want to buy a new graphics card, I chose RX6400 or Intel ARC380. While watching the review, I noticed that the A380 requires the RESIZABLE BAR option to be enabled. In the case of HP eltiedesk g9 computers, we have SFF and Tower options. The Tower option (also Q670 chipset) was released with the following graphics chipsets: NVIDIA® T400 (4 GB GDDR6 dedicated); NVIDIA® GeForce RTXTM 3060 (12 GB GDDR6 dedicated); NVIDIA® GeForce RTXTM 3050 (8 GB GDDR6 dedicated); **Intel® ArcTM A380 Graphics (6 GB GDDR6 dedicated**); AMD RadeonTM RX 6300 Graphics (2 GB GDDR6 dedicated). Intel ARC A380 was available, however, only with Intel Core 13th processors (e.g. i5-13500). The SFF option had the following GPU models: NVIDIA® T400 (4 GB GDDR6 dedicated); NVIDIA® T400 (2 GB GDDR6 dedicated); AMD RadeonTM RX 6300 Graphics (2 GB GDDR6 dedicated) Question: Can anyone confirm that Intel ARC380 works properly in the HP Elitedesk 800 G9 SFF I have? Specifically, does this HP model have the RESIZABLE BAR option in UEFI? The A380 is a newer graphics system and, despite driver bugs, has greater hopes for the future than the RX6400. There is almost no GTX1650 on the market, I don't want to spend money on the A2000. Regards, I'm waiting for your answer and I wish you a Merry Christmas!	1.0	t3_18pqzm7	reddit

When I transported my PC from one place to another, the screw that fixated my SSD m2 on the motherboard got loose and the SSD detached and fell off. I noticed this when I wanted to start a game and realized that my SSD was not detected. So I opened the casing, saw that the SSD fell off and reinstalled it on the motherboard. When booting the PC again I suddenly got the following message: ""New CPU installed. fTPM/PSP NV corrupted or fTPM/PSP NV structure damaged. Press Y to reset fTPM. If you have BitLocker oder encryption enabled, the system will not boot without a recovery key. Press N to keep previous fTPM record and continue system boot. fTPM will NOT enable in new CPU to recover TPM related keys and data"" I don't know how reinstalling my SSD on the motherboard is connected to the CPU though. I initially pressed N but nothing happened. Then I pressed Y and the PC started booting. It took a lot more time to boot than usual and when it finally reached the desktop, I wanted to find out if my SSD was now detected by the system. But it was not. So I looked up what I can do to fix this. At first I opened the device manager and looked up if there was a new driver available but Windows said I already have the latest driver. Then I opened disk manager and couldn't find it there. So I have two problems now: 1. PC starts much slower than before. 2. 2. SSD is not detected.

It occasionally hangs during operation, but I counter this rather cleverly by doing a handful of tasks at a time. If I think it's too hot... off to the fridge she goes in a suspended state if not completely powered off. As for storage, I confine personal data to a micro sd card. Little annoying linux doesn't have fingerprint sensor compatability across the board. I've heard the reason that the cause of the heat is the emmc, so I'm wondering if anyone has torn one of these devices down and attempted a chip swap... if someone has, I would LOVE to fix that.

To boot normally, I must reset the BIOS by removing and then reinserting the CMOS battery.

My system includes an MSI X-570A PRO motherboard and an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X processor. Here's what I've tried so far: * Switching the HDMI connection from the GPU to the motherboard. * Cleaning the internal components of the computer. * Updating the BIOS to the latest version twice, which interestingly doesn't lead to a black screen after the update. * Replacing the CMOS battery with a new one.	1.0	t3_18p7bn9	reddit

Unknown	2023-12-23 06:33:24	https://www.reddit.com/r/computer/comments/18ozo5f/should_i_return_this_gpu/	"Hi, I recently purchased a PCWinMax RTX 3060m Frankenstein, to use for gaming and some mining on the side. The seller claimed the only issue was that the HDMI was the only functional port, without using the Frankenstein drivers. However, upon placing it into my PC, my PC would have a black screen. However, all the lights were on, showing that the PC was on, but no display was being generated. The fans also worked completely fine on the GPU. I tried switching to integrated graphics, and when I did that, the GPU was not recognized in system browser nor in device manager. Also, given the fact that I didn't even see any display given to the monitor when trying to boot to BIOs, thats a big thing that makes me very unsure. I really don't want to return this GPU, as I got it for a really good deal, and the seller SWEARS up and down that it is completely functional. Any advice? I have tried fiddling with BIOs settings, but nothing I did gave me any results. The lane is functional as I have used 3 different cards with it. I have an ASRock H270 Pro4, i5-7500, 32 GBs of RAM.

I’m currently a senior in high school and I need a new laptop for college, anyways, so it all works out. Thing is that I’m a digital artist and animator, and with my old laptop it would start to lag once I worked on my animations near the end of production, so I feel like I should get a laptop with better specs but I know next to nothing about what would help me. Me and my mom have been looking at HP and Lenovo products, since I’ve heard good things about both companies. We’ve mainly been looking at 2-in-1’s, since I am the type of person to get an idea while I’m out and grind out the work the next moment I can and I go to an art-based high school. Not to mention that it saves a lot of cable space that usually is there when I used my Asus with my Wacom One. So far, I’ve narrowed it down to the HP Envy and the Lenovo Yoga 7i, and I’m a little torn and figured if anyone knew, it would (probably) be Reddit. If anyone knows of any other types of brands or laptops that would be good, please let me know! I primarily use Clip Studio Paint as an art and animation software and we’re aiming under $700, if that helps any. Tysm in advance! :D	4.0	t3_18oytng	reddit

When tomorrow came my windows would no longer boot at all and I can't get beyond the bios boot up. I've checked my bootorder, the ssd that I boot from usually is still there, all of my HD are there too. The boot order is correct. Yet it says that I need to select a medium to boot from. And I'm unable to boot from even external sources. I've brought both a CD and a flashdrive with windows 10 and I can't boot either. It goes straight into black screen if I try.

668	Does my computer actually have Thunderbolt 4 or is it a lie???	Unknown	2023-12-21 16:38:11	https://www.reddit.com/r/computer/comments/18nr5h5/does_my_computer_actually_have_thunderbolt_4_or/	"I just bought a new laptop, a **Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 i5-13/16/512 14,5""** Lenovo's website did a scan of my computer and told me it's a [**Yoga Pro 7 14IRH8 - Type 82Y7**](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/yoga-series/yoga-pro-7-14irh8/82y7/82y7009fmx/yx07qwds) I'm guessing it's just a different name for the same thing. It has an Intel processor. Anyway, the issue I'm having is that I thought this computer had Thunderbolt 4, but now I'm unsure. There is a little lightning bolt next to one of the USB-C ports, but I can't find anything in Windows to confirm this. I don't have any devices or cables that support Thunderbolt 4, so I can't do speed tests or anything. In device manager, this is all I see: https://preview.redd.it/61utoq6beo7c1.png?width=742&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6b050f5b86ec06858690cb93f6ba1d5f3a4d0a0 Nothing indicating Thunderbolt. I've followed some instructions I found while googling for a solution, different places to check for the word Thunderbolt. Nothing. In the manual that came with the computer, there's an overview of all inputs and, for the one with the lightning bolt, it says: https://preview.redd.it/k43ahijheo7c1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=8592db209d7b126bcbd928974fcb26c566089117 &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/6tqre0akeo7c1.png?width=266&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b5e7c82f32bc6c1bc688f6718595bb04a3a0098 On the product page of the store I bought it from, it says: >*- 1x USB-C 4 Gen 3x2-port- 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2-port- 1x USB-A 3.2 Gen1-port* And further down, it says >*Thunderbolt 4: Yes* This is all the documentation I've found indicating Thunderbolt 4 on this machine. But again, nothing inside of Windows itself suggests that I have Thunderbolt 4 so I'm skeptical. I wonder if I'm missing a driver, maybe something I can download from [here](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/yoga-series/yoga-pro-7-14irh8/82y7/82y7009fmx/yx07qwds), but I don't know which one or why it wouldn't have installed automatically when I did Windows Update or the Lenovo update. &#x200B;"	3.0	t3_18nr5h5	reddit

I have checked previous history, and there is very little left. As in, maybe just a few days of history before those tabs. It appears that my previous history might be gone (although I don't know if that is normal? Can I expand previous history to see further back on Chrome? I'm a bit scared to touch anything) My computer has restarted on its own around that time. But that might be due to me always postponing updates 'till it forces the update.

What she's using right now is a macbook air that i got from my school in 2016, so the model year or whatever has got to be 2015/2016 too. And so i was thinking of buying a laptop that is around 300 dollars, she doesn't need something super expensive or crazy since all she does on it is watch hockey, movies/tv shows and facebook. The macbook right now is having problems with the swedish streaming service for hockey games and i think its just the OS system thats so old or whatever so i wanna surprise her with a new one, her current one will take like 10-15 seconds to load up a facebook page. Sorry if im rambling but would a ''current'' laptop for about 300 dollars be a great upgrade to her 2015/2016 macbook air?

I spent a lot of time on restoring it from factory because i kept getting an error code no matter what i did. Finally i succeeded with it after a few days and it asked me to upgrade to Windows 11 and i did. Since then i have noticed a performance drop in specifically COD3/Warzone which is the only game i play currently. I have never monitored my system before i upgraded to Windows 11 so i don't have anything to compare it to, but it just doesn't feel as good as it used to. Every few seconds it feels like the frames drop for a milliseconds and then it's back to normal again. It's choppy and almost feels a bit like the typical COD server lagg, but only on my system and nobody else is lagging. I get around 75fps pretty consistantly ingame (my monitor is 75Hz). When i get the weird choppy lagg thing i sometimes see the frames drop to around 60, but sometimes it doesn't even drop frames. I don't know if it's actually because of the frames or some latency thing. Other than that everything seems pretty normal to me. I use the system for creative work and programs like Premiere, After Effect and Photoshop works fine. GPU is around or just above 80% celsius when i'm ingame. **GPU:** RTX 2080 SUPER (Installed 2019) **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 5900X (Installed 2021) **RAM:** Corsair Vengance DDR4 4x16GB (Installed 2019) I have tried a lot of tips and fixes from articles and YouTube videoes but nothing seems to fix the issue. Is it time to upgrade the GPU? It worked fine in Windows 10, so i'm not sure if the GPU is the issue...	4.0	t3_18m98pn	reddit

Unknown	2023-12-19 02:19:47	https://www.reddit.com/r/computer/comments/18lqm8v/do_i_need_a_new_laptop/	I have a HP ENVY 15t-j000 Quad Edition CTO Notebook PC laptop that I purchased in 2013. 8GB RAM. Originally Microsoft office 8 originally but it is now windows 10 home. It has 654GB free out of 903 GB memory. I recently bought a 15.6 inch HP Envy 2 in 1 touchscreen laptops from Costco. 32GB 1T memory. Windows 11. 4lbs. My current computer has gotten VERY slow over the last year, the last 4 months specifically, the battery and charger, which has been replaced a few times definitely doesn’t last long. At max capacity I feel like an hour maybe. Infrequently use excel and it is so slow. If I have multiple windows open it just doesn’t work super well. I mostly use the laptop for streaming, internet browsing, personal business and some organizations I volunteer for. I wanted something less heavy, faster, and one I could take with my for work sometimes or commuting where I can use the touchscreen. I almost bought an LG gram or a smaller convertible laptop. But the screen for the 15.6 is nice, albeit a bit larger than an iPad or something. Should I have purchased the new laptop? Is there anything I could do to my current laptop to make it a bit faster, or did is the RAM and age of the computer something that can’t be overcome?	3.0	t3_18lqm8v	reddit

I've come to the realization that a system restore is the best, easiest solution. Most things he needs can be synced through his google account. The only obstacle I've encountered is in trying to save his progress in an online poker game he started playing. He plays as a guest and never created an actual account. Because of this, if I restore the computer, I risk losing his progress. I'd like to avoid this if possible, although it's not the end of the world if I do. My question is if there's a solution as simple as copying his cookies (or some other files) before doing a restore and then copying them back once the restore is complete. I'm guessing his IP address may have something to do with it as well. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks	1.0	t3_18ln2jf	reddit

722	Discount gaming computer	Unknown	2023-12-18 21:50:07	https://www.reddit.com/r/computer/comments/18lkmhj/discount_gaming_computer/	Hello! About a year ago, I bought a refurbished dell optiplex 9010 with no intention of ever turning it into a gaming computer. Now that winter is coming tho, I've wanted to see if i could turn it into a very basic gaming computer. (Disclaimer: I'm very new to all this) Specs: - intel core i7 3770 - 16 gb installed RAM - 64 bit operating system It didn't come with a separate graphics card, so I bought a Geoforce GTX 1650 and plugged it in. I chose that graphics card because my psu only puts out 240 watts and I read that this card was pretty efficient in its power draw. One YouTube vid even had a guy put this card in his optiplex with the same power supply. So I installed the card, I opened up a pretty simple game (Inside the backrooms) and everything was extremely laggy. Like move your mouse, wait 60 seconds, then your character turns. I meet the recommended specs for this game so I'm confused why it was so laggy? Any workarounds I could try would be much appreciated. Trying to avoid returning this gpu and spending any more money.	1.0	t3_18lkmhj	reddit

December 2nd, I purchased an A770 BiFrost from MicroCenter. I live a good 45 minutes from MC and decided it's worth a drive, I enjoy the store. They also had it at a good price, per most stuff that can be found there. Just to preface, the rgb's and fans always turned on. Fans would ramp up and down throughout everything. I install the GPU, immediately it's not working. I can enter bios, but as soon as I close the bios to boot windows, is where I run into my issues. My Motherboard is ASRock. I have the ASRock logo pop up for maybe a 1/4 of a second, then the video signal stops. I can hear the windows 11 start sound through my speakers, but it sounds crackily and laggy. Tested a couple HDMI cables on my Samsung TV and MSI monitor. Also tried DisplayPort to my monitor. Nothing. I go on Reddit and browse around, trying all kinds of diagnostics. From using DDU multiple times, to fresh windows install. Switching between pci-e buses. Trying different PSU supply wires. Installing driver's in safe mode. The works. Every once In a while, across a 6 hour combined time span it would boot and work. It's beyond my understanding why it would boot far enough where I could sign in to windows, but within minutes the video would cut out. I got far enough one time that I was able to quickly download Minecraft bedrock and try the ray tracing, crashed and back to square 0 again with basically no video. It eventually started just boot looping. I call Acer tech support (my biggest mistake, should have just returned the card to MC.). I'm in the US. I'm on the phone for about 50 minutes going through troubleshooting and trying stuff. Most wouldn't work due to just no video output. They issue an RMA. Label is emailed to me by December 4th. Was busy with family and work, so shipped it out on December 5th. I received a new GPU (new S/N) back this past Saturday, December 16th. Get home late from a family event, around 11. Take my 1660ti back out, installed the A770 again. Same issues. Only decided to put about an hour into it before getting fed up. Put my 1660ti back in, pc starts up like normal and just works. Assuming the new card is also a dud. Yesterday, December 17th decided to try and see if MicroCenter could take it back, no dice. Different card than they sold. Called Acer again to simply request they take this card back, and give me my old card back so I can just try again to take it back to micro center. The support rep says that my case is going to have to be ""elevated to more advanced tech support"" due the nature of the case. Support rep mentions that they could probably work something out to get a different product. I'm not interested. Support says I should receive a call in 1 Business day. That's basically where I'm at now. Waiting for tech support. I'm home from work sick today, so it actually works out to get stuff done with this ASAP. Hoping they call me. If not, you best believe I'll be in contact with them again. Will keep my story updated as things go on. Has anyone gone through a similar road of just wanting the original card to be returned to get a refund? Thanks for letting me rant."	1.0	t3_18lelt4	reddit

If I disable the 960 I get about 5fps at best on benchmark but disabling the igpu does nothing different and benchmark still shows the igpu. Any ideas what the issue may be? Games seem to run fine considering the specs. Not sure what's gone on but I had a 750ti in there which tested fine, and then swapped it out for a 960 and now it shows my igpu only	6.0	t3_18l9hgi	reddit

Also, when renaming a file, it only changes the file creation date sometimes. For example today, I renamed a scanned file from the default ""scan0001"" to something like ""File name 1"" and ""File name 2"". When I renamed it by pasting in a name, the file creation date changed. When I typed it, file 1 didn't change but file 2 did. Then, when I undid the rename and tried ""File name\_2"" the file creation date didn't change. This doesn't happen for all files, but happens regardless of the file type. It can't be because of the date I made the folder because the date the folder is made shouldn't change the date the file was created. I also didn't open the file so the modified date shouldn't change either, but sometimes the modified date is earlier than the creation date.

750	Proactive Edge Computing in Latency-Constrained Fog Networks	Mohammed S. Elbamby	2017-04-22 05:37:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06749v2	In this paper, the fundamental problem of distribution and proactive caching of computing tasks in fog networks is studied under latency and reliability constraints. In the proposed scenario, computing can be executed either locally at the user device or offloaded to an edge cloudlet. Moreover, cloudlets exploit both their computing and storage capabilities by proactively caching popular task computation results to minimize computing latency. To this end, a clustering method to group spatially proximate user devices with mutual task popularity interests and their serving cloudlets is proposed. Then, cloudlets can proactively cache the popular tasks' computations of their cluster members to minimize computing latency. Additionally, the problem of distributing tasks to cloudlets is formulated as a matching game in which a cost function of computing delay is minimized under latency and reliability constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme guarantees reliable computations with bounded latency and achieves up to 91% decrease in computing latency as compared to baseline schemes.			arxiv	['Mehdi Bennis', 'Walid Saad']	264.0
751	Heterogeneous Computation Assignments in Coded Elastic Computing	Nicholas Woolsey	2020-01-12 22:27:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04005v1	We study the optimal design of a heterogeneous coded elastic computing (CEC) network where machines have varying relative computation speeds. CEC introduced by Yang {\it et al.} is a framework which mitigates the impact of elastic events, where machines join and leave the network. A set of data is distributed among storage constrained machines using a Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) code such that any subset of machines of a specific size can perform the desired computations. This design eliminates the need to re-distribute the data after each elastic event. In this work, we develop a process for an arbitrary heterogeneous computing network to minimize the overall computation time by defining an optimal computation load, or number of computations assigned to each machine. We then present an algorithm to define a specific computation assignment among the machines that makes use of the MDS code and meets the optimal computation load.			arxiv	['Rong-Rong Chen', 'Mingyue Ji']	265.0

Despite being a new paradigm of computation, cloud computing owes its origins to a number of previous paradigms. The term cloud computing is well defined and no longer merits rigorous taxonomies to furnish a definition. Instead this survey paper considers the past, present and future of cloud computing. As an evolution of previous paradigms, we consider the predecessors to cloud computing and what significance they still hold to cloud services. Additionally we examine the technologies which comprise cloud computing and how the challenges and future developments of these technologies will influence the field. Finally we examine the challenges that limit the growth, application and development of cloud computing and suggest directions required to overcome these challenges in order to further the success of cloud computing.			arxiv	['Adam Barker']	267.0

DCM 2015 was organized as a one-day satellite event of the 12th International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of Computing (ICTAC 2015). Several new models of computation have emerged in the last few years, and many developments of traditional computational models have been proposed with the aim of taking into account the new demands of computer systems users and the new capabilities of computation engines. A new computational model, or a new feature in a traditional one, usually is reflected in a new family of programming languages, and new paradigms of software development. The aim of the DCM workshop series is to bring together researchers who are currently developing new computational models or new features for traditional computational models, in order to foster their interaction, to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn about current activities in this area. Topics of interest include all abstract models of computation and their applications to the development of programming languages and systems.			arxiv	['Jorge A. Pérez']	268.0

Understanding the computational power of this model, which corresponds to polynomial-time quantum computation that can be efficiently verified classically, is a well-known open problem in quantum computing. Our result shows that computing the order of a solvable group, which is one of the most general problems for which quantum computing exhibits an exponential speed-up with respect to classical computing, can be realized in this model.			arxiv	['Tomoyuki Morimae', 'Harumichi Nishimura', 'Yuki Takeuchi']	269.0

One potentially upsetting result is that all four notions of asymptotic computability admit ""almost computable"" sets in every Turing degree via coding tricks, contradicting the notion that ""almost computable"" sets should be computationally close to the computable sets. In response, Astor introduced the notion of intrinsic density: a set has defined intrinsic density if its image under any computable permutation has the same asymptotic density. Furthermore, Astor also introduced various notions of intrinsic computation in which the standard coding tricks cannot be used to embed intrinsically computable sets in every Turing degree. Our goal is to study the sets which are intrinsically small, i.e. those that have intrinsic density zero. We begin by studying which computable functions preserve intrinsic smallness. We also show that intrinsic smallness and hyperimmunity are computationally independent notions of smallness, i.e. any hyperimmune degree contains a Turing-equivalent hyperimmune set which is ""as large as possible"" and therefore not intrinsically small. Our discussion concludes by relativizing the notion of intrinsic smallness and discussing intrinsic computability as it relates to our study of intrinsic smallness."			arxiv	[]	271.0
757	Computation Resource Leasing for Priority Aggregation Local Computing Network	Chao Ren	2019-10-31 04:33:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14253v1	In large scale smart edge networks, computation resource is generally underutilized due to the uneven distribution of computation resource in time and space domain. This may correspond to a simple fact that no device is capable for 'storing' and 'exchanging' idle computation resource. Thus, this paper proposes a computation resource leasing (CRL) concept using priority as an intermediary to restore and exchange the permission for computation resource for priority aggregation local computing network (PALCN). Each device in PALNC is able to gain priority as a reward for leasing its computing resource to others. CRL also offers a priority oriented algorithm to match the computation request with idle source nodes and a priority management model. Our analysis and numerical results show that the system can efficiently utilize local idle computation sources over time and space domain and filtrate the big task that local computation can not finish.			arxiv	['Haijun Zhang', 'Jingze Hou', 'others']	272.0

In this paper, we explore DEC that exploits distributed edge devices connected by a wireless network to perform a computation task offloaded from an end device. In particular, we study the fundamental problem of minimizing the delay of executing a distributed algorithm of the computation task. We first establish some structural properties of the optimal communication scheduling policy. Then, given these properties, we characterize the optimal computation allocation policy, which can be found by an efficient algorithm. Next, based on the optimal computation allocation, we characterize the optimal scheduling order of communications for some special cases, and develop an efficient algorithm with a finite approximation ratio to find it for the general case. Last, based on the optimal computation allocation and communication scheduling, we further show that the optimal selection of devices can be found efficiently for some special cases. Our results provide some useful insights for the optimal computation-communication co-design. We evaluate the performance of the theoretical findings using simulations.			arxiv	[]	273.0

However, as FAPs have limited computational capabilities and are solely assisted by a remote cloud center in the baseband processing unit (BBU) of the cloud radio access (C-RAN) network, the latency benefits of this fog-computing C-RAN network may be worn off when facing a large number of offloading requests. In this paper, we investigate the delay minimization problem for task offloading in a hierarchical fog-computing C-RAN network, which consists of three tiers of computational services: MEC server in radio units, MEC server in distributed units, and the cloud computing in central units. The receive beamforming vectors, task allocation, computing speed for offloaded tasks in each server and the transmission bandwidth split of fronthaul links are optimized by solving the formulated mixed integer programming problem. The simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed hierarchical fog-computing C-RAN network in terms of the delay performance.			arxiv	['Huilin Jiang', 'Huiling Zhu', 'Jiangzhou Wang']	274.0

Progress is slowing because digital silicon computers have reached their limits in terms of speed. Other types of computation using radically different architectures, including neuromorphic and quantum, promise breakthroughs in both speed and efficiency. Quantum computing exploits the coherence and superposition properties of quantum systems to explore many possible computational paths in parallel. This provides a fundamentally more efficient route to solving some types of computational problems, including several of relevance to biological simulations. In particular, optimisation problems, both convex and non-convex, feature in many biological models, including protein folding and molecular dynamics. Early quantum computers will be small, reminiscent of the early days of digital silicon computing. Understanding how to exploit the first generation of quantum hardware is crucial for making progress in both biological simulation and the development of the next generations of quantum computers. This review outlines the current state-of-the-art and future prospects for quantum computing, and provides some indications of how and where to apply it to speed up bottlenecks in biological simulation.			arxiv	[]	275.0
761	Computation harvesting in road traffic dynamics	Hiroyasu Ando	2020-11-21 08:22:19	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10744v1	Owing to recent advances in artificial intelligence and internet of things (IoT) technologies, collected big data facilitates high computational performance, while its computational resources and energy cost are large. Moreover, data are often collected but not used. To solve these problems, we propose a framework for a computational model that follows a natural computational system, such as the human brain, and does not rely heavily on electronic computers. In particular, we propose a methodology based on the concept of `computation harvesting', which uses IoT data collected from rich sensors and leaves most of the computational processes to real-world phenomena as collected data. This aspect assumes that large-scale computations can be fast and resilient. Herein, we perform prediction tasks using real-world road traffic data to show the feasibility of computation harvesting. First, we show that the substantial computation in traffic flow is resilient against sensor failure and real-time traffic changes due to several combinations of harvesting from spatiotemporal dynamics to synthesize specific patterns. Next, we show the practicality of this method as a real-time prediction because of its low computational cost. Finally, we show that, compared to conventional methods, our method requires lower resources while providing a comparable performance.			arxiv	['T. Okamoto', 'H. Chang', 'T.

Towards maximizing the system's weighted computation rate (i.e., the number of weighted users' computing bits within a finite time horizon) subject to the users' energy causality constraints due to dynamic energy arrivals, the decision for joint computation offloading and local computing over time is optimized {\em over time}. Assuming that the profile of channel state information and dynamic task arrivals at the users is known in advance, the weighted computation rate maximization problem becomes a convex optimization problem. Building on the Lagrange duality method, the well-structured optimal solution is analytically obtained. Both the users' local computing and offloading rates are shown to have a monotonically increasing structure. Numerical results show that the proposed design scheme can achieve a significant performance gain over the alternative benchmark schemes.			arxiv	['Feng Wang', 'Licheng Liu']	277.0

Miranda	2021-10-24 10:56:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12408v1	Quantum computing is a nascent technology, which is advancing rapidly. There is a long history of research into using computers for music. Nowadays computers are absolutely essential for the music economy. Thus, it is very likely that quantum computers will impact the music industry in time to come. This chapter lays the foundations of the new field of 'Quantum Computer Music'. It begins with an introduction to algorithmic computer music and methods to program computers to generate music, such as Markov chains and random walks. Then, it presents quantum computing versions of those methods. The discussions are supported by detailed explanations of quantum computing concepts and walk-through examples. A bespoke generative music algorithm is presented, the Basak-Miranda algorithm, which leverages a property of quantum mechanics known as constructive and destructive interference to operate a musical Markov chain. An Appendix introducing the fundamentals of quantum computing deemed necessary to understand the chapter and a link to access Jupyter Notebooks with examples are also provided.			arxiv	['Suchitra T.

The high shares of renewables and the wide deployment of converter-interfaced resources require new tools that shall drastically accelerate power system computations, including optimization and security assessment, which can benefit from quantum computing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that goes beyond quantum computing simulations and performs an experimental application of Quantum Computing for power systems on a real quantum computer. We use five different quantum computers, apply the HHL quantum algorithm, and examine the impact of current noisy quantum hardware on the accuracy and speed of an AC power flow algorithm. We perform the same studies on a 3-bus and a 5-bus system with real quantum computers to identify challenges and open research questions related with the scalability of these algorithms.			arxiv	['Spyros Chatzivasileiadis', 'Hjörtur Jóhannsson', 'Jacob Østergaard']	280.0

Among the approaches to define computability in these sets, order-theoretic structures have proven to be useful. Here, we discuss the mathematical structure needed to define computability using order-theoretic concepts. In particular, we introduce a more general framework and discuss its limitations compared to the previous one in domain theory. We expose four features in which the stronger requirements in the domain-theoretic structure allow to improve upon the more general framework: computable elements, computable functions, model dependence of computability and complexity theory. Crucially, we show computability of elements in uncountable spaces can be defined in this new setup, and argue why this is not the case for computable functions. Moreover, we show the stronger setup diminishes the dependence of computability on the chosen order-theoretic structure and that, although a suitable complexity theory can be defined in the stronger framework and the more general one posesses a notion of computable elements, there appears to be no proper notion of element complexity in the latter.			arxiv	['Daniel A.

(Ordinary) Difference Equations. It presents a new framework using these equations as a central tool for computation and algorithm design. We present the general theory of discrete ODEs for computation theory, we illustrate this with various examples of algorithms, and we provide several implicit characterizations of complexity and computability classes. The proposed framework presents an original point of view on complexity and computation classes. It unifies several constructions that have been proposed for characterizing these classes including classical approaches in implicit complexity using restricted recursion schemes, as well as recent characterizations of computability and complexity by classes of continuous ordinary differential equations. It also helps understanding the relationships between analog computations and classical discrete models of computation theory. At a more technical point of view, this paper points out the fundamental role of linear (discrete) ODEs and classical ODE tools such as changes of variables to capture computability and complexity measures, or as a tool for programming many algorithms.			arxiv	['Arnaud Durand']	282.0
768	Comprehension from Chaos: Towards Informed Consent for Private Computation	Bailey Kacsmar	2022-11-13 21:56:29	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07026v2	Private computation, which includes techniques like multi-party computation and private query execution, holds great promise for enabling organizations to analyze data they and their partners hold while maintaining data subjects' privacy. Despite recent interest in communicating about differential privacy, end users' perspectives on private computation have not previously been studied. To fill this gap, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews investigating users' understanding of, and expectations for, private computation over data about them. Interviews centered on four concrete data-analysis scenarios (e.g., ad conversion analysis), each with a variant that did not use private computation and another that did (private set intersection, multi-party computation, and privacy preserving query procedures). While participants struggled with abstract definitions of private computation, they found the concrete scenarios enlightening and plausible even though we did not explain the complex cryptographic underpinnings. Private computation increased participants' acceptance of data sharing, but not unconditionally; the purpose of data sharing and analysis was the primary driver of their attitudes. Through collective activities, participants emphasized the importance of detailing the purpose of a computation and clarifying that inputs to private computation are not shared across organizations when describing private computation to end users.			arxiv	['Vasisht Duddu', 'Kyle Tilbury', 'Blase Ur', 'Florian Kerschbaum']	283.0
769	Incorporating Ethics in Computing Courses: Perspectives from Educators	Jessie J. Smith	2022-12-12 20:05:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06220v2	Incorporating ethics into computing education has become a priority for the SIGCSE community. Many computing departments and educators have contributed to this endeavor by creating standalone computing ethics courses or integrating ethics modules and discussions into preexisting curricula. In this study, we hope to support this effort by reporting on computing educators' attitudes toward including ethics in their computing classroom, with a special focus on the structures that hinder or help this endeavor. We surveyed 138 higher education computing instructors to understand their attitudes toward including ethics in their classes, what barriers might be preventing them from doing so, and which structures best support them. We found that even though instructors were generally positive about ethics as a component of computing education, there are specific barriers preventing ethics from being included in some computing courses. In this work, we explore how to alleviate these barriers and outline support structures that could encourage further integration of ethics and computing in higher education.			arxiv	['Blakeley H.

770	Cloud Computing: Applications, Challenges and Open Issues	Sahil Mishra	2023-05-27 11:52:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17454v1	Cloud computing is one of the innovative computing, which deals with storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet [1]. It is the delivery of computing resources and services, such as storing of data on servers and databases, providing networking facilities and software development platforms over the Internet. It provides the flexibility of resources for everyone. These services are provided via data centers, which are located in various parts of the world [2, 3]. Cloud computing makes access to these resources to everyone on a global scale at a very minimal cost and significantly higher speed. These servers provide services to the users, which would have cost a lot of computational power to them if they had to buy them. The first mention of cloud computing was referenced in a Compaq internal document released in 1996 [4]. Cloud computing was then commercialized in 2006 when Amazon released elastic compute cloud (EC2). Furthermore, Google released Google app engine in 2008 and Microsoft Azure services were launched in October 2008, which increased the competition in the area of cloud computing. Since then these companies have done a lot of development in cloud computing.			arxiv	['Sanjaya Kumar Panda']	285.0
771	Reordered Computable Numbers	Philip Janicki	2023-10-23 14:35:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14986v2	A real number is called left-computable if there exists a computable increasing sequence of rational numbers converging to it. In this article we are investigating a proper subset of the left-computable numbers. We say that a real number $x$ is reordered computable if there exist a computable function $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 2^{-f(k)} = x$ and a bijective function $\sigma \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that the rearranged series $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 2^{-f(\sigma(k))}$ converges computably. In this article we will give some examples and counterexamples for reordered computable numbers and we will show that these numbers are closed under addition, multiplication and the Solovay reduction. Furthermore, we will show that all reordered computable numbers are not hyperimmune, and we will show that all left-computable numbers which are not immune are reordered computable. Finally, we will also present a density theorem for reordered computable numbers.			arxiv	[]	286.0
772	Exploiting Storage for Computing: Computation Reuse in Collaborative Edge Computing	Xingqiu He	2024-01-08 01:24:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03620v1	Collaborative Edge Computing (CEC) is a new edge computing paradigm that enables neighboring edge servers to share computational resources with each other. Although CEC can enhance the utilization of computational resources, it still suffers from resource waste. The primary reason is that end-users from the same area are likely to offload similar tasks to edge servers, thereby leading to duplicate computations. To improve system efficiency, the computation results of previously executed tasks can be cached and then reused by subsequent tasks. However, most existing computation reuse algorithms only consider one edge server, which significantly limits the effectiveness of computation reuse. To address this issue, this paper applies computation reuse in CEC networks to exploit the collaboration among edge servers. We formulate an optimization problem that aims to minimize the overall task response time and decompose it into a caching subproblem and a scheduling subproblem. By analyzing the properties of optimal solutions, we show that the optimal caching decisions can be efficiently searched using the bisection method. For the scheduling subproblem, we utilize projected gradient descent and backtracking to find a local minimum. Numerical results show that our algorithm significantly reduces the response time in various situations.			arxiv	['Chaoqun You', 'Tony Q. S. Quek']	287.0
773	Axiomatic Theory of Algorithms: Computability and Decidability in Algorithmic Classes	Mark Burgin	2004-09-08 22:30:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0409142v1	Axiomatic approach has demonstrated its power in mathematics. The main goal of this preprint is to show that axiomatic methods are also very efficient for computer science. It is possible to apply these methods to many problems in computer science. Here the main modes of computer functioning and program execution are described, formalized, and studied in an axiomatic context. The emphasis is on three principal modes: computation, decision, and acceptation. Now the prevalent mode for computers is computation. Problems of artificial intelligence involve decision mode, while communication functions of computer demand accepting mode. The main goal of this preprint is to study properties of these modes and relations between them. These problems are closely related to such fundamental concepts of computer science and technology as computability, decidability, and acceptability. In other words, we are concerned with the question what computers and software systems can do working in this or that mode. Consequently, results of this preprint allow one to achieve higher understanding of computations and in such a way, to find some basic properties of computers and their applications. Classes of algorithms, which model different kinds of computers and software, are compared with respect to their computing, accepting or deciding power. Operations with algorithms and machines are introduced. Examples show how to apply axiomatic results to different classes of algorithms and machines in order to enhance their performance.			arxiv	[]	288.0
774	Are all reversible computations tidy?	O. J. E. Maroney	2004-03-10 08:35:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403079v1	"It has long been known that to minimise the heat emitted by a deterministic computer during it's operation it is necessary to make the computation act in a logically reversible manner\cite{Lan61}. Such logically reversible operations require a number of auxiliary bits to be stored, maintaining a history of the computation, and which allows the initial state to be reconstructed by running the computation in reverse. These auxiliary bits are wasteful of resources and may require a dissipation of energy for them to be reused. A simple procedure due to Bennett\cite{Ben73} allows these auxiliary bits to be ""tidied"", without dissipating energy, on a classical computer. All reversible classical computations can be made tidy in this way. However, this procedure depends upon a classical operation (""cloning"") that cannot be generalised to quantum computers\cite{WZ82}. Quantum computations must be logically reversible, and therefore produce auxiliary qbits during their operation. We show that there are classes of quantum computation for which Bennett's procedure cannot be implemented. For some of these computations there may exist another method for which the computation may be ""tidied"". However, we also show there are quantum computations for which there is no possible method for tidying the auxiliary qbits. Not all reversible quantum computations can be made ""tidy"". This represents a fundamental additional energy burden to quantum computations. This paper extends results in \cite{Mar01}."			arxiv	[]	289.0

I'm talking about cloud computing, where applications and files are hosted on a ""cloud"" consisting of thousands of computers and servers, all linked together and accessible via the Internet. With cloud computing, everything you do is now web based instead of being desktop based. You can access all your programs and documents from any computer that's connected to the Internet. How will cloud computing change the way you work? For one thing, you're no longer tied to a single computer. You can take your work anywhere because it's always accessible via the web. In addition, cloud computing facilitates group collaboration, as all group members can access the same programs and documents from wherever they happen to be located. Cloud computing might sound far-fetched, but chances are you're already using some cloud applications. If you're using a web-based email program, such as Gmail or Hotmail, you're computing in the cloud. If you're using a web-based application such as Google Calendar or Apple Mobile Me, you're computing in the cloud.

776	On the Weak Computability of Continuous Real Functions	Matthew S. Bauer	2010-06-02 14:30:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0394v1	In computable analysis, sequences of rational numbers which effectively converge to a real number x are used as the (rho-) names of x. A real number x is computable if it has a computable name, and a real function f is computable if there is a Turing machine M which computes f in the sense that, M accepts any rho-name of x as input and outputs a rho-name of f(x) for any x in the domain of f. By weakening the effectiveness requirement of the convergence and classifying the converging speeds of rational sequences, several interesting classes of real numbers of weak computability have been introduced in literature, e.g., in addition to the class of computable real numbers (EC), we have the classes of semi-computable (SC), weakly computable (WC), divergence bounded computable (DBC) and computably approximable real numbers (CA). In this paper, we are interested in the weak computability of continuous real functions and try to introduce an analogous classification of weakly computable real functions. We present definitions of these functions by Turing machines as well as by sequences of rational polygons and prove these two definitions are not equivalent. Furthermore, we explore the properties of these functions, and among others, show their closure properties under arithmetic operations and composition.			arxiv	['Xizhong Zheng']	291.0
777	A Fundamental Tradeoff between Computation and Communication in Distributed Computing	Songze Li	2016-04-24 22:10:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07086v2	"How can we optimally trade extra computing power to reduce the communication load in distributed computing? We answer this question by characterizing a fundamental tradeoff between computation and communication in distributed computing, i.e., the two are inversely proportional to each other. More specifically, a general distributed computing framework, motivated by commonly used structures like MapReduce, is considered, where the overall computation is decomposed into computing a set of ""Map"" and ""Reduce"" functions distributedly across multiple computing nodes. A coded scheme, named ""Coded Distributed Computing"" (CDC), is proposed to demonstrate that increasing the computation load of the Map functions by a factor of $r$ (i.e., evaluating each function at $r$ carefully chosen nodes) can create novel coding opportunities that reduce the communication load by the same factor. An information-theoretic lower bound on the communication load is also provided, which matches the communication load achieved by the CDC scheme. As a result, the optimal computation-communication tradeoff in distributed computing is exactly characterized. Finally, the coding techniques of CDC is applied to the Hadoop TeraSort benchmark to develop a novel CodedTeraSort algorithm, which is empirically demonstrated to speed up the overall job execution by $1.97\times$ - $3.39\times$, for typical settings of interest."			arxiv	['Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali', 'Qian Yu', 'A.

778	Global Versus Local Computations: Fast Computing with Identifiers	Rabie Mikaël	2016-09-21 11:44:25	http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06508v2	This paper studies what can be computed by using probabilistic local interactions with agents with a very restricted power in polylogarithmic parallel time. It is known that if agents are only finite state (corresponding to the Population Protocol model by Angluin et al.), then only semilinear predicates over the global input can be computed. In fact, if the population starts with a unique leader, these predicates can even be computed in a polylogarithmic parallel time. If identifiers are added (corresponding to the Community Protocol model by Guerraoui and Ruppert), then more global predicates over the input multiset can be computed. Local predicates over the input sorted according to the identifiers can also be computed, as long as the identifiers are ordered. The time of some of those predicates might require exponential parallel time. In this paper, we consider what can be computed with Community Protocol in a polylogarithmic number of parallel interactions. We introduce the class CPPL corresponding to protocols that use $O(n\log^k n)$, for some k, expected interactions to compute their predicates, or equivalently a polylogarithmic number of parallel expected interactions. We provide some computable protocols, some boundaries of the class, using the fact that the population can compute its size. We also prove two impossibility results providing some arguments showing that local computations are no longer easy: the population does not have the time to compare a linear number of consecutive identifiers. The Linearly Local languages, such that the rational language $(ab)^*$, are not computable.			arxiv	[]	293.0
779	Distributed Computing with Heterogeneous Communication Constraints: The Worst-Case Computation Load and Proof by Contradiction	Nishant Shakya	2018-02-01 17:47:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00413v2	We consider a distributed computing framework where the distributed nodes have different communication capabilities, motivated by the heterogeneous networks in data centers and mobile edge computing systems. Following the structure of MapReduce, this framework consists of Map computation phase, Shuffle phase, and Reduce computation phase. The Shuffle phase allows distributed nodes to exchange intermediate values, in the presence of heterogeneous communication bottlenecks for different nodes (heterogeneous communication load constraints). For this setting, we characterize the minimum total computation load and the minimum worst-case computation load in some cases, under the heterogeneous communication load constraints. While the total computation load depends on the sum of the computation loads of all the nodes, the worst-case computation load depends on the computation load of a node with the heaviest job. We show an interesting insight that, for some cases, there is a tradeoff between the minimum total computation load and the minimum worst-case computation load, in the sense that both cannot be achieved at the same time. The achievability schemes are proposed with careful design on the file assignment and the data shuffling. Beyond the cut-set bound, a novel converse is proposed using the proof by contradiction. For the general case, we identify two extreme regimes in which both the scheme with coding and the scheme without coding are optimal, respectively.			arxiv	['Fan Li', 'Jinyuan Chen']	294.0
780	Wireless Powered User Cooperative Computation in Mobile Edge Computing Systems	Dixiao Wu	2018-09-05 10:48:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01430v1	This paper studies a wireless powered mobile edge computing (MEC) system, where a dedicated energy transmitter (ET) uses the radio-frequency (RF) signal enabled wireless power transfer (WPT) to charge wireless devices for sustainable computation. In such a system, we present a new user cooperation approach to improve the computation performance of active devices, in which surrounding idle devices are enabled as helpers to use their opportunistically harvested wireless energy from the ET to help remotely execute active users' computation tasks. In particular, we consider a basic scenario with one user (with computation tasks to execute) and multiple helpers, in which the user can partition the computation tasks into various parts for local execution and computation offloading to helpers, respectively. Both the user and helpers are subject to the so-called energy neutrality constraints, such that their energy consumption does not exceed the respective energy harvested from the ET. Under this setup and considering a frequency division multiple access (FDMA) based computation offloading protocol, we maximize the computation rate (i.e., the number of computation bits over a particular time block) of the user, by jointly optimizing the transmit energy beamforming at the ET, as well as the communication and computation resource allocations at both the user and helpers. By leveraging the Lagrange duality method, we present the optimal solution to this problem in a semi-closed form. Numerical results show that the proposed wireless powered user cooperative computation design significantly improves the computation rate at the user, as compared to conventional schemes without such cooperation.			arxiv	['Feng Wang', 'Xiaowen Cao', 'Jie Xu']	295.0
781	Timely-Throughput Optimal Coded Computing over Cloud Networks	Chien-Sheng Yang	2019-04-11 04:16:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05522v1	In modern distributed computing systems, unpredictable and unreliable infrastructures result in high variability of computing resources. Meanwhile, there is significantly increasing demand for timely and event-driven services with deadline constraints. Motivated by measurements over Amazon EC2 clusters, we consider a two-state Markov model for variability of computing speed in cloud networks. In this model, each worker can be either in a good state or a bad state in terms of the computation speed, and the transition between these states is modeled as a Markov chain which is unknown to the scheduler. We then consider a Coded Computing framework, in which the data is possibly encoded and stored at the worker nodes in order to provide robustness against nodes that may be in a bad state. With timely computation requests submitted to the system with computation deadlines, our goal is to design the optimal computation-load allocation scheme and the optimal data encoding scheme that maximize the timely computation throughput (i.e, the average number of computation tasks that are accomplished before their deadline). Our main result is the development of a dynamic computation strategy called Lagrange Estimate-and Allocate (LEA) strategy, which achieves the optimal timely computation throughput. It is shown that compared to the static allocation strategy, LEA increases the timely computation throughput by 1.4X - 17.5X in various scenarios via simulations and by 1.27X - 6.5X in experiments over Amazon EC2 clusters			arxiv	['Ramtin Pedarsani', 'A.

782	Monoidal computer III: A coalgebraic view of computability and complexity	Dusko Pavlovic	2017-04-17 06:27:29	http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04882v3	Monoidal computer is a categorical model of intensional computation, where many different programs correspond to the same input-output behavior. The upshot of yet another model of computation is that a categorical formalism should provide a much needed high level language for theory of computation, flexible enough to allow abstracting away the low level implementation details when they are irrelevant, or taking them into account when they are genuinely needed. A salient feature of the approach through monoidal categories is the formal graphical language of string diagrams, which supports visual reasoning about programs and computations. In the present paper, we provide a coalgebraic characterization of monoidal computer. It turns out that the availability of interpreters and specializers, that make a monoidal category into a monoidal computer, is equivalent with the existence of a *universal state space*, that carries a weakly final state machine for any pair of input and output types. Being able to program state machines in monoidal computers allows us to represent Turing machines, to capture their execution, count their steps, as well as, e.g., the memory cells that they use. The coalgebraic view of monoidal computer thus provides a convenient diagrammatic language for studying computability and complexity.			arxiv	['Muzamil Yahia']	297.0
783	Truth Table Minimization of Computational Models	Netanel Raviv	2013-06-17 08:34:50	http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3766v1	Complexity theory offers a variety of concise computational models for computing boolean functions - branching programs, circuits, decision trees and ordered binary decision diagrams to name a few. A natural question that arises in this context with respect to any such model is this: Given a function f:{0,1}^n \to {0,1}, can we compute the optimal complexity of computing f in the computational model in question? (according to some desirable measure). A critical issue regarding this question is how exactly is f given, since a more elaborate description of f allows the algorithm to use more computational resources. Among the possible representations are black-box access to f (such as in computational learning theory), a representation of f in the desired computational model or a representation of f in some other model. One might conjecture that if f is given as its complete truth table (i.e., a list of f's values on each of its 2^n possible inputs), the most elaborate description conceivable, then any computational model can be efficiently computed, since the algorithm computing it can run poly(2^n) time. Several recent studies show that this is far from the truth - some models have efficient and simple algorithms that yield the desired result, others are believed to be hard, and for some models this problem remains open. In this thesis we will discuss the computational complexity of this question regarding several common types of computational models. We shall present several new hardness results and efficient algorithms, as well as new proofs and extensions for known theorems, for variants of decision trees, formulas and branching programs.			arxiv	[]	298.0
784	Hierarchical Fog-Cloud Computing for IoT Systems: A Computation Offloading Game	Hamed Shah-Mansouri	2017-10-17 04:31:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06089v1	Fog computing, which provides low-latency computing services at the network edge, is an enabler for the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) systems. In this paper, we study the allocation of fog computing resources to the IoT users in a hierarchical computing paradigm including fog and remote cloud computing services. We formulate a computation offloading game to model the competition between IoT users and allocate the limited processing power of fog nodes efficiently. Each user aims to maximize its own quality of experience (QoE), which reflects its satisfaction of using computing services in terms of the reduction in computation energy and delay. Utilizing a potential game approach, we prove the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium and provide an upper bound for the price of anarchy. Since the time complexity to reach the equilibrium increases exponentially in the number of users, we further propose a near-optimal resource allocation mechanism and prove that in a system with $N$ IoT users, it can achieve an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium in $O(N/\epsilon)$ time. Through numerical studies, we evaluate the users' QoE as well as the equilibrium efficiency. Our results reveal that by utilizing the proposed mechanism, more users benefit from computing services in comparison to an existing offloading mechanism. We further show that our proposed mechanism significantly reduces the computation delay and enables low-latency fog computing services for delay-sensitive IoT applications.			arxiv	['Vincent W. S.

These systems share the common feature that humans are active participants, making choices that determine the input to, and therefore the output of, the system. The output of these systems can be viewed as a joint computation between machine and human, and can be richer than what either could produce alone. The term social computing is often used as a synonym for several related areas, such as ""human computation"" and subsets of ""collective intelligence""; we use it in its broadest sense to encompass all of these things. Social computing is blossoming into a rich research area of its own, with contributions from diverse disciplines including computer science, economics, and other social sciences. Yet a broad mathematical foundation for social computing is yet to be established, with a plethora of under-explored opportunities for mathematical research to impact social computing. As in other fields, there is great potential for mathematical work to influence and shape the future of social computing. However, we are far from having the systematic and principled understanding of the advantages, limitations, and potentials of social computing required to match the impact on applications that has occurred in other fields.

786	Daemon computers versus clairvoyant computers: A pure theoretical viewpoint towards energy consumption of computing	Alireza Ejlali	2020-11-12 15:58:22	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09856v1	Energy consumption of computing has found increasing prominence but the area still suffers from the lack of a consolidated formal theory. In this paper, a theory for the energy consumption of computing is structured as an axiomatic system. The work is pure theoretical, involving theorem proving and mathematical reasoning. It is also interdisciplinary, so that while it targets computing, it involves theoretical physics (thermodynamics and statistical mechanics) and information theory. The theory does not contradict existing theories in theoretical physics and conforms to them as indeed it adopts its axioms from them. Nevertheless, the theory leads to interesting and important conclusions that have not been discussed in previous work. Some of them are: (i) Landauer's principle is shown to be a provable theorem provided that a precondition, named macroscopic determinism, holds. (ii) It is proved that real randomness (not pseudo randomness) can be used in computing in conjunction with or as an alternative to reversibility to achieve more energy saving. (iii) The theory propounds the concept that computers that use real randomness may apparently challenge the second law of thermodynamics. These are computational counterpart to Maxwell's daemon in thermodynamics and hence are named daemon computers. (iv) It is proved that if we do not accept the existence of daemon computers (to conform to the second law of thermodynamics), another type of computers, named clairvoyant computers, must exist that can gain information about other physical systems through real randomness. This theorem probably provides a theoretical explanation for strange observations about real randomness made in the global consciousness project at Princeton University.			arxiv	[]	301.0
787	A Network-based Compute Reuse Architecture for IoT Applications	Boubakr Nour	2021-04-08 14:57:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03818v1	The tremendous advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) increasingly involve computationally intensive services. These services often require more computation resources than can entirely be satisfied on local IoT devices. Cloud computing is traditionally used to provide unlimited computation resources at distant servers. However, such remote computation may not address the short-delay constraints that many of today's IoT applications require. Edge computing allows offloading computing close to end users to overcome computation and delay issues. Nonetheless, the edge servers may suffer from computing inefficiencies. Indeed, some IoT applications are invoked multiple times by multiple devices. These invocations are often used with the same or similar input data, which leads to the same computational output (results). Still, the edge server willfully executes all received redundant tasks. In this work, we investigate the use of the computation reuse concept at the edge server. We design a network-based computation reuse architecture for IoT applications. The architecture stores previously executed results and reuses them to satisfy newly arrived similar tasks instead of performing computation from scratch. By doing so, we eliminate redundant computation, optimize resource utilization, and decrease task completion time. We implemented the architecture and evaluated its performance both at the networking and application levels. From the networking perspective, we reach up to an 80\% reduction in task completion time and up to 60\% reduction in resource utilization. From the application perspective, we achieve up to 90\% computation correctness and accuracy.			arxiv	['Soumaya Cherkaoui']	302.0

Symbolic Computation is the science of computing with symbolic objects (terms, formulae, programs, representations of algebraic objects, etc.). Powerful algorithms have been developed during the past decades for the major subareas of symbolic computation: computer algebra and computational logic. These algorithms and methods are successfully applied in various fields, including software science, which covers a broad range of topics about software construction and analysis. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence methods and machine learning algorithms are widely used nowadays in various domains and, in particular, combined with symbolic computation. Several approaches mix artificial intelligence and symbolic methods and tools deployed over large corpora to create what is known as cognitive systems. Cognitive computing focuses on building systems that interact with humans naturally by reasoning, aiming at learning at scale. The purpose of SCSS is to promote research on theoretical and practical aspects of symbolic computation in software science, combined with modern artificial intelligence techniques. These proceedings contain the keynote paper by Bruno Buchberger and ten contributed papers. Besides, the conference program included three invited talks, nine short and work-in-progress papers, and a special session on computer algebra and computational logic. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the symposium was held completely online.

As responding, the hybrid edge and cloud computing (ECC) system has been expected as a promising solution to handle the increasing computational applications with low-latency and on-demand services of computation offloading, which requires new computing resource sharing and access control technology paradigms. This work establishes a software-defined networking (SDN) based architecture for edge/cloud computing services in 5G heterogeneous networks (HetNets), which can support efficient and on-demand computing resource management to optimize resource utilization and satisfy the time-varying computational tasks uploaded by user devices. In addition, resulting from the information incompleteness, we design an evolutionary game based service selection for users, which can model the replicator dynamics of service subscription. Based on this dynamic access model, a Stackelberg differential game based cloud computing resource sharing mechanism is proposed to facilitate the resource trading between the cloud computing service provider (CCP) and different edge computing service providers (ECPs). Then we derive the optimal pricing and allocation strategies of cloud computing resource based on the replicator dynamics of users' service selection. These strategies can promise the maximum integral utilities to all computing service providers (CPs), meanwhile the user distribution can reach the evolutionary stable state at this Stackelberg equilibrium. Furthermore, simulation results validate the performance of the designed resource sharing mechanism, and reveal the convergence and equilibrium states of user selection, and computing resource pricing and allocation.			arxiv	['Chunxiao Jiang', 'Abderrahim Benslimane', 'Song Guo', 'Yong Ren']	304.0
790	A Hybrid Artificial Neural Network for Task Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing	Raby Hamadi	2022-06-06 14:47:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06301v1	Edge Computing (EC) is about remodeling the way data is handled, processed, and delivered within a vast heterogeneous network. One of the fundamental concepts of EC is to push the data processing near the edge by exploiting front-end devices with powerful computation capabilities. Thus, limiting the use of centralized architecture, such as cloud computing, to only when it is necessary. This paper proposes a novel edge computer offloading technique that assigns computational tasks generated by devices to potential edge computers with enough computational resources. The proposed approach clusters the edge computers based on their hardware specifications. Afterwards, the tasks generated by devices will be fed to a hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that predicts, based on these tasks, the profiles, i.e., features, of the edge computers with enough computational resources to execute them. The predicted edge computers are then assigned to the cluster they belong to so that each task is assigned to a cluster of edge computers. Finally, we choose for each task the edge computer that is expected to provide the fastest response time. The experiment results show that our proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art machine learning approaches using real-world IoT dataset.			arxiv	['Abdullah Khanfor', 'Hakim Ghazzai', 'Yehia Massoud']	305.0
791	An Online Resource Scheduling for Maximizing Quality-of-Experience in Meta Computing	Yandi Li	2023-04-26 11:34:50	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13463v1	Meta Computing is a new computing paradigm, which aims to solve the problem of computing islands in current edge computing paradigms and integrate all the resources on a network by incorporating cloud, edge, and particularly terminal-end devices. It throws light on solving the problem of lacking computing power. However, at this stage, due to technical limitations, it is impossible to integrate the resources of the whole network. Thus, we create a new meta computing architecture composed of multiple meta computers, each of which integrates the resources in a small-scale network. To make meta computing widely applied in society, the service quality and user experience of meta computing cannot be ignored. Consider a meta computing system providing services for users by scheduling meta computers, how to choose from multiple meta computers to achieve maximum Quality-of-Experience (QoE) with limited budgets especially when the true expected QoE of each meta computer is not known as a priori? The existing studies, however, usually ignore the costs and budgets and barely consider the ubiquitous law of diminishing marginal utility. In this paper, we formulate a resource scheduling problem from the perspective of the multi-armed bandit (MAB). To determine a scheduling strategy that can maximize the total QoE utility under a limited budget, we propose an upper confidence bound (UCB) based algorithm and model the utility of service by using a concave function of total QoE to characterize the marginal utility in the real world. We theoretically upper bound the regret of our proposed algorithm with sublinear growth to the budget. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted, and the results indicate the correctness and effectiveness of our algorithm.			arxiv	['Jianxiong Guo', 'Yupeng Li', 'Tian Wang', 'Weijia Jia']	306.0
792	Handoff-Aware Distributed Computing in High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS)-Assisted Vehicular Networks	Qiqi Ren	2023-05-07 05:50:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04196v1	Distributed computing enables Internet of vehicle (IoV) services by collaboratively utilizing the computing resources from the network edge and the vehicles. However, the computing interruption issue caused by frequent edge network handoffs, and a severe shortage of computing resources are two problems in providing IoV services. High altitude platform station (HAPS) computing can be a promising addition to existing distributed computing frameworks because of its wide coverage and strong computational capabilities. In this regard, this paper proposes an adaptive scheme in a new distributed computing framework that involves HAPS computing to deal with the two problems of the IoV. Based on the diverse demands of vehicles, network dynamics, and the time-sensitivity of handoffs, the proposed scheme flexibly divides each task into three parts and assigns them to the vehicle, roadside units (RSUs), and a HAPS to perform synchronous computing. The scheme also constrains the computing of tasks at RSUs such that they are completed before handoffs to avoid the risk of computing interruptions. On this basis, we formulate a delay minimization problem that considers task-splitting ratio, transmit power, bandwidth allocation, and computing resource allocation. To solve the problem, variable replacement and successive convex approximation-based method are proposed. The simulation results show that this scheme not only avoids the negative effects caused by handoffs in a flexible manner, it also takes delay performance into account and maintains the delay stability.			arxiv	['Omid Abbasi', 'Gunes Karabulut Kurt', 'Halim Yanikomeroglu', 'Jian Chen']	307.0
793	Efficient techniques to GPU Accelerations of Multi-Shot Quantum Computing Simulations	Jun Doi	2023-08-07 08:32:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03399v1	Quantum computers are becoming practical for computing numerous applications. However, simulating quantum computing on classical computers is still demanding yet useful because current quantum computers are limited because of computer resources, hardware limits, instability, and noises. Improving quantum computing simulation performance in classical computers will contribute to the development of quantum computers and their algorithms. Quantum computing simulations on classical computers require long performance times, especially for quantum circuits with a large number of qubits or when simulating a large number of shots for noise simulations or circuits with intermediate measures. Graphical processing units (GPU) are suitable to accelerate quantum computer simulations by exploiting their computational power and high bandwidth memory and they have a large advantage in simulating relatively larger qubits circuits. However, GPUs are inefficient at simulating multi-shots runs with noises because the randomness prevents highly parallelization. In addition, GPUs have a disadvantage in simulating circuits with a small number of qubits because of the large overheads in GPU kernel execution. In this paper, we introduce optimization techniques for multi-shot simulations on GPUs. We gather multiple shots of simulations into a single GPU kernel execution to reduce overheads by scheduling randomness caused by noises. In addition, we introduce shot-branching that reduces calculations and memory usage for multi-shot simulations. By using these techniques, we speed up x10 from previous implementations.			arxiv	['Hiroshi Horii', 'Christopher Wood']	308.0

858	Probabilistic Automata for Computing with Words	Yongzhi Cao	2006-04-23 02:58:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0604087v1	Usually, probabilistic automata and probabilistic grammars have crisp symbols as inputs, which can be viewed as the formal models of computing with values. In this paper, we first introduce probabilistic automata and probabilistic grammars for computing with (some special) words in a probabilistic framework, where the words are interpreted as probabilistic distributions or possibility distributions over a set of crisp symbols. By probabilistic conditioning, we then establish a retraction principle from computing with words to computing with values for handling crisp inputs and a generalized extension principle from computing with words to computing with all words for handling arbitrary inputs. These principles show that computing with values and computing with all words can be respectively implemented by computing with some special words. To compare the transition probabilities of two near inputs, we also examine some analytical properties of the transition probability functions of generalized extensions. Moreover, the retractions and the generalized extensions are shown to be equivalence-preserving. Finally, we clarify some relationships among the retractions, the generalized extensions, and the extensions studied recently by Qiu and Wang.			arxiv	['Lirong Xia', 'Mingsheng Ying']	373.0
859	Instant Computing - A New Computation Paradigm	Hans-Rudolf Thomann	2006-10-19 14:11:38	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0610114v3	Voltage peaks on a conventional computer's power lines allow for the well-known dangerous DPA attacks. We show that measurement of a quantum computer's transient state during a computational step reveals information about a complete computation of arbitrary length, which can be extracted by repeated probing, if the computer is suitably programmed. Instant computing, as we name this mode of operation, recognizes for any total or partial recursive function arguments lying in the domain of definition and yields their function value with arbitrary small error probability in probabilistic linear time. This implies recognition of (not necessarily recursively enumerable) complements of recursively enumerable sets and the solution of the halting problem. Future quantum computers are shown to be likely to allow for instant computing, and some consequences are pointed out.			arxiv	[]	374.0
860	Polynomial Simulations of Decohered Quantum Computers	Dorit Aharonov	1996-11-17 17:24:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9611029v1	We define formally decohered quantum computers (using density matrices), and present a simulation of them by a probabalistic classical Turing Machine. We study the slowdown of the simulation for two cases: (1) sequential quantum computers, or quantum Turing machines(QTM), and (2) parallel quantum computers, or quantum circuits. This paper shows that the computational power of decohered quantum computers depends strongly on the amount of parallelism in the computation. The expected slowdown of the simulation of a QTM is polynomial in time and space of the quantum computation, for any non zero decoherence rate. This means that a QTM subjected to any amount of noise is worthless. For decohered quantum circuits, the situation is more subtle and depends on the decoherence rate, eta. We find that our simulation is efficient for circuits with decoherence rate higher than some constant, but exponential for general circuits with decoherence rate lower than some other constant. Using computer experiments, we show that the transition from exponential cost to polynomial cost happens in a short range of decoherence rates, and exhibit the phase transitions in various quantum circuits.			arxiv	['Michael Ben-Or']	375.0
861	Scalable NMR Quantum Computation	Leonard J. Schulman	1998-04-24 21:44:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9804060v1	Nuclear magnetic resonance offers an appealing prospect for implementation of quantum computers, because of the long coherence times associated with nuclear spins, and extensive laboratory experience in manipulating the spins with radio frequency pulses. Existing proposals, however, suffer from a signal-to-noise ratio that decays exponentially in the number of qubits in the quantum computer. This places a severe limit on the size of the computations that can be performed by such a computer; estimates of that limit are well within the range in which a conventional computer taking exponentially more steps would still be practical. We give an NMR implementation in which the signal-to-noise ratio depends only on features of NMR technology, not the size of the computer. This provides a means for NMR computation techniques to scale to sizes at which the exponential speedup enables quantum computation to solve problems beyond the capabilities of classical computers.			arxiv	['Umesh Vazirani']	376.0
862	Quantum Computing with Very Noisy Devices	E. Knill	2004-10-25 21:33:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410199v2	In theory, quantum computers can efficiently simulate quantum physics, factor large numbers and estimate integrals, thus solving otherwise intractable computational problems. In practice, quantum computers must operate with noisy devices called ``gates'' that tend to destroy the fragile quantum states needed for computation. The goal of fault-tolerant quantum computing is to compute accurately even when gates have a high probability of error each time they are used. Here we give evidence that accurate quantum computing is possible with error probabilities above 3% per gate, which is significantly higher than what was previously thought possible. However, the resources required for computing at such high error probabilities are excessive. Fortunately, they decrease rapidly with decreasing error probabilities. If we had quantum resources comparable to the considerable resources available in today's digital computers, we could implement non-trivial quantum computations at error probabilities as high as 1% per gate.			arxiv	[]	377.0

868	Faster Geometric Algorithms via Dynamic Determinant Computation	Vissarion Fisikopoulos	2012-06-29 16:24:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.7067v3	The computation of determinants or their signs is the core procedure in many important geometric algorithms, such as convex hull, volume and point location. As the dimension of the computation space grows, a higher percentage of the total computation time is consumed by these computations. In this paper we study the sequences of determinants that appear in geometric algorithms. The computation of a single determinant is accelerated by using the information from the previous computations in that sequence. We propose two dynamic determinant algorithms with quadratic arithmetic complexity when employed in convex hull and volume computations, and with linear arithmetic complexity when used in point location problems. We implement the proposed algorithms and perform an extensive experimental analysis. On one hand, our analysis serves as a performance study of state-of-the-art determinant algorithms and implementations. On the other hand, we demonstrate the supremacy of our methods over state-of-the-art implementations of determinant and geometric algorithms. Our experimental results include a 20 and 78 times speed-up in volume and point location computations in dimension 6 and 11 respectively.			arxiv	['Luis Peñaranda']	383.0
869	Robust Analog Function Computation via Wireless Multiple-Access Channels	Mario Goldenbaum	2012-10-10 16:14:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.2967v1	Various wireless sensor network applications involve the computation of a pre-defined function of the measurements without the need for reconstructing each individual sensor reading. Widely-considered examples of such functions include the arithmetic mean and the maximum value. Standard approaches to the computation problem separate computation from communication: quantized sensor readings are transmitted interference-free to a fusion center that reconstructs each sensor reading and subsequently computes the sought function value. Such separation-based computation schemes are generally highly inefficient as a complete reconstruction of individual sensor readings is not necessary for the fusion center to compute a function of them. In particular, if the mathematical structure of the wireless channel is suitably matched (in some sense) to the function, then channel collisions induced by concurrent transmissions of different nodes can be beneficially exploited for computation purposes. Therefore, in this paper a practically relevant analog computation scheme is proposed that allows for an efficient estimate of linear and nonlinear functions over the wireless multiple-access channel. After analyzing the asymptotic properties of the estimation error, numerical simulations are presented to show the potential for huge performance gains when compared with time-division multiple-access based computation schemes.			arxiv	['Sławomir Stańczak']	384.0

These two computability notions are natural generalizations of certain notions introduced in a previous paper co-authored by Andreas Weiermann and in another previous paper by the same authors, respectively. Under certain weak assumptions about the class in question, we show that conditional computability is preserved by substitution, that all conditionally computable real functions are locally uniformly computable, and that the ones with compact domains are uniformly computable. The introduced notions have some similarity with the uniform computability and its non-uniform extension considered by Katrin Tent and Martin Ziegler, however, there are also essential differences between the conditional computability and the non-uniform computability in question.			arxiv	['Dimiter Skordev']	385.0

Our definition is based on the concept of E Turing machines (for Enumerating Turing Machines) and on the concept of approximation of E Turing machines for which we also gave a formal definition. We precise here these definitions through some modifications intended to improve the robustness of the concept. We introduce then a new concept: the Computational Analogy and prove some properties of computationally analog functions. Computational Analogy is an equivalence relation which allows partitioning the set of computable functions in classes whose members have the same properties regarding to their computational irreducibility and their computational complexity.			arxiv	[]	386.0
872	Quantum Computing's Classical Problem, Classical Computing's Quantum Problem	Rodney Van Meter	2013-10-08 08:36:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2040v1	Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum computing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of classical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been demonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of calculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what humans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass what our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do. At the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those advances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the discrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological advances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive landscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical systems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will discuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.			arxiv	[]	387.0
873	Computing in permutation groups without memory	Peter J. Cameron	2013-10-22 18:45:19	http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6008v1	Memoryless computation is a new technique to compute any function of a set of registers by updating one register at a time while using no memory. Its aim is to emulate how computations are performed in modern cores, since they typically involve updates of single registers. The memoryless computation model can be fully expressed in terms of transformation semigroups, or in the case of bijective functions, permutation groups. In this paper, we consider how efficiently permutations can be computed without memory. We determine the minimum number of basic updates required to compute any permutation, or any even permutation. The small number of required instructions shows that very small instruction sets could be encoded on cores to perform memoryless computation. We then start looking at a possible compromise between the size of the instruction set and the length of the resulting programs. We consider updates only involving a limited number of registers. In particular, we show that binary instructions are not enough to compute all permutations without memory when the alphabet size is even. These results, though expressed as properties of special generating sets of the symmetric or alternating groups, provide guidelines on the implementation of memoryless computation.			arxiv	['Ben Fairbairn', 'Maximilien Gadouleau']	388.0
874	Identifying Benefits and risks associated with utilizing cloud computing	Jafar Shayan	2014-01-21 02:52:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5155v1	Cloud computing is an emerging computing model where IT and computing operations are delivered as services in highly scalable and cost effective manner. Recently, embarking this new model in business has become popular. Companies in diverse sectors intend to leverage cloud computing architecture, platforms and applications in order to gain higher competitive advantages. Likewise other models, cloud computing brought advantages to attract business but meanwhile fostering cloud has led to some risks, which can cause major impacts if business does not plan for mitigation. This paper surveys the advantages of cloud computing and in contrast the risks associated using them. Finally we conclude that a well-defined risk management program that focused on cloud computing is an essential part of gaining value from benefits of cloud computing.			arxiv	['Ahmad Azarnik', 'Suriayati Chuprat', 'Sasan Karamizadeh', 'Mojtaba Alizadeh']	389.0

Performance-per-watt is a critical metric for the evaluation of computer architectures for cost- efficient computing. Additionally, future performance growth will come from heterogeneous, many-core, and high computing density platforms with specialized processors. In this paper, we examine the Intel Xeon Phi Many Integrated Cores (MIC) co-processor and Applied Micro X-Gene ARMv8 64-bit low-power server system-on-a-chip (SoC) solutions for scientific computing applications. We report our experience on software porting, performance and energy efficiency and evaluate the potential for use of such technologies in the context of distributed computing systems such as the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG).			arxiv	['Brian Bockelman', 'Peter Elmer', 'Giulio Eulisse', 'Robert Knight', 'Shahzad Muzaffar']	390.0
876	Quantum Iterative Deepening with an application to the Halting problem	Luís Tarrataca	2015-02-06 17:28:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02030v1	Classical models of computation traditionally resort to halting schemes in order to enquire about the state of a computation. In such schemes, a computational process is responsible for signalling an end of a calculation by setting a halt bit, which needs to be systematically checked by an observer. The capacity of quantum computational models to operate on a superposition of states requires an alternative approach. From a quantum perspective, any measurement of an equivalent halt qubit would have the potential to inherently interfere with the computation by provoking a random collapse amongst the states. This issue is exacerbated by undecidable problems such as the \textit{Entscheidungsproblem} which require universal computational models, \textit{e.g.} the classical Turing machine, to be able to proceed indefinitely. In this work we present an alternative view of quantum computation based on production system theory in conjunction with Grover's amplitude amplification scheme that allows for (1) a detection of halt states without interfering with the final result of a computation; (2) the possibility of non-terminating computation and (3) an inherent speedup to occur during computations susceptible of parallelization. We discuss how such a strategy can be employed in order to simulate classical Turing machines.			arxiv	['Andreas Wichert']	391.0
877	Proceedings Tenth International Workshop on Developments in Computational Models	Ugo Dal Lago	2015-04-08 12:03:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01927v1	This volume contains the papers presented at the Tenth International Workshop on Developments in Computational Models (DCM) held in Vienna, Austria on 13th July 2014, as part of the Vienna Summer of Logic. Several new models of computation have emerged in the last years, and many developments of traditional computational models have been proposed with the aim of taking into account the new demands of computer systems users and the new capabilities of computation engines. A new computational model, or a new feature in a traditional one, usually is reflected in a new family of programming languages, and new paradigms of software development. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers who are currently developing new computational models or new features for traditional computational models, in order to foster their interaction, to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn about current activities in this area. Topics of interest include all abstract models of computation and their applications to the development of programming languages and systems.			arxiv	['Russ Harmer']	392.0

It is shown that the halting set can compute a surjective linear isometry between any two computable copies of $\ell^p$. It is also shown that this result is optimal in that when $p \neq 2$ there are two computable copies of $\ell^p$ with the property that any oracle that computes a linear isometry of one onto the other must also compute the halting set. Thus, $\ell^p$ is $\Delta_2^0$-categorical and is computably categorical if and only if $p = 2$. It is also shown that there is a computably categorical Banach space that is not a Hilbert space and that $\ell^p$ is linearly isometric to a computable Banach space if and only if $p$ is computable. These results hold in both the real and complex case.			arxiv	[]	393.0
879	Duality quantum computer and the efficient quantum simulations	Shi-Jie Wei	2015-07-12 07:50:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.03200v1	In this paper, we firstly briefly review the duality quantum computer. Distinctly, the generalized quantum gates, the basic evolution operators in a duality quantum computer are no longer unitary, and they can be expressed in terms of linear combinations of unitary operators. All linear bounded operators can be realized in a duality quantum computer, and unitary operators are just the extreme points of the set of generalized quantum gates. A d-slits duality quantum computer can be realized in an ordinary quantum computer with an additional qudit using the duality quantum computing mode. Duality quantum computer provides flexibility and clear physical picture in designing quantum algorithms, serving as a useful bridge between quantum and classical algorithms. In this review, we will show that duality quantum computer can simulate quantum systems more efficiently than ordinary quantum computers by providing descriptions of the recent efficient quantum simulation algorithms of Childs et al [Quantum Information & Computation, 12(11-12): 901-924 (2012)] for the fast simulation of quantum systems with a sparse Hamiltonian, and the quantum simulation algorithm by Berry et al [Phys.

Mutiara	2015-12-17 09:08:10	http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05499v1	Today, people are looking forward to get an awesome computational power. This kind of desire can be answered by quantum computing. By adopting quantum mechanics theory, it can generate a very fast computation result. As known, quantum mechanics can establish that particle can also become wave; it shows that electron can be in duality. Through this theory, even a human teleportation is issued can be really happened in the future. However, it needs a high requirement of hardware support to implement the real quantum computing. That is why it is difficult to bring quantum computing into reality. This research presents a study about quantum computing. Here it is studied, a specialty of quantum computing, like superposition, as if the classical computer can do it. Since there was a marvellous research about quantum computer simulation that runs on classical computer, this research provides an analysis about our testing and implementation of Quantum Gate and Measurement Emulator (QGAME). Our analysis, testing and implementation are based on a method that always use in the software engineering field.			arxiv	['R. Refianti', 'J. S. K. Karamoy']	395.0
881	Zero-Suppressed Computation: A New Computation Inspired by ZDDs	Hiroki Morizumi	2016-02-25 18:58:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08034v1	Zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams (ZDDs) are a data structure representing Boolean functions, and one of the most successful variants of binary decision diagrams (BDDs). On the other hand, BDDs are also called branching programs in computational complexity theory, and have been studied as a computation model. In this paper, we consider ZDDs from the viewpoint of computational complexity theory. Our main proposal of this paper is that we regard the basic idea of ZDDs as a new computation, which we call zero-suppressed computation. We consider the zero-suppressed version of two classical computation models, decision trees and branching programs, and show some results. Although this paper is mainly written from the viewpoint of computational complexity theory, the concept of zero-suppressed computation can be widely applied to various areas.			arxiv	[]	396.0

After a survey of current academic and non-academic programs across the globe, we focus on Canadian programs and specifically on the education program of the SciNet HPC Consortium, using its detailed enrollment and course statistics for the past four to five years. Not only do these data display a steady and rapid increase in the demand for research-computing instruction, they also show a clear shift from traditional (high performance) computing to data-oriented methods. It is argued that this growing demand warrants specialized research computing degrees. The possible curricula of such degrees are described next, taking existing programs as an example, and adding SciNet's experiences of student desires as well as trends in advanced research computing.			arxiv	['Erik Spence', 'Daniel Gruner', 'Ramses van Zon']	397.0
883	Privacy Preserving Distance Computation using Somewhat-trusted Third Parties	Abelino Jimenez	2016-09-16 19:02:04	http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05178v2	"A critically important component of most signal processing procedures is that of computing the distance between signals. In multi-party processing applications where these signals belong to different parties, this introduces privacy challenges. The signals may themselves be private, and the parties to the computation may not be willing to expose them. Solutions proposed to the problem in the literature generally invoke homomorphic encryption schemes, secure multi-party computation, or other cryptographic methods which introduce significant computational complexity into the proceedings, often to the point of making more complex computations requiring repeated computations unfeasible. Other solutions invoke third parties, making unrealistic assumptions about their trustworthiness. In this paper we propose an alternate approach, also based on third party computation, but without assuming as much trust in the third party. Individual participants to the computation ""secure"" their data through a proposed secure hashing scheme with shared keys, prior to sharing it with the third party. The hashing ensures that the third party cannot recover any information about the individual signals or their statistics, either from analysis of individual computations or their long-term aggregate patterns. We provide theoretical proof of these properties and empirical demonstration of the feasibility of the computation."			arxiv	['Bhiksha Raj']	398.0

Zidan	2016-12-09 04:41:25	http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02913v4	For decades, advances in electronics were directly driven by the scaling of CMOS transistors according to Moore's law. However, both the CMOS scaling and the classical computer architecture are approaching fundamental and practical limits, and new computing architectures based on emerging devices, such as resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices, are expected to sustain the exponential growth of computing capability. Here we propose a novel memory-centric, reconfigurable, general purpose computing platform that is capable of handling the explosive amount of data in a fast and energy-efficient manner. The proposed computing architecture is based on a uniform, physical, resistive, memory-centric fabric that can be optimally reconfigured and utilized to perform different computing and data storage tasks in a massively parallel approach. The system can be tailored to achieve maximal energy efficiency based on the data flow by dynamically allocating the basic computing fabric for storage, arithmetic, and analog computing including neuromorphic computing tasks.			arxiv	['YeonJoo Jeong', 'Jong Hong Shin', 'Chao Du', 'Zhengya Zhang', 'Wei D.

885	Communication-Aware Computing for Edge Processing	Songze Li	2017-06-22 23:34:16	http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07523v1	We consider a mobile edge computing problem, in which mobile users offload their computation tasks to computing nodes (e.g., base stations) at the network edge. The edge nodes compute the requested functions and communicate the computed results to the users via wireless links. For this problem, we propose a Universal Coded Edge Computing (UCEC) scheme for linear functions to simultaneously minimize the load of computation at the edge nodes, and maximize the physical-layer communication efficiency towards the mobile users. In the proposed UCEC scheme, edge nodes create coded inputs of the users, from which they compute coded output results. Then, the edge nodes utilize the computed coded results to create communication messages that zero-force all the interference signals over the air at each user. Specifically, the proposed scheme is universal since the coded computations performed at the edge nodes are oblivious of the channel states during the communication process from the edge nodes to the users.			arxiv	['Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali', 'A.

886	Toward a Phenomenology of Computational Thinking in STEM Education	Pratim Sengupta	2018-01-28 17:58:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09258v1	In this chapter, we argue for an epistemological shift from viewing coding and computational thinking as mastery over computational logic and symbolic forms, to viewing them as a more complex form of experience. Rather than viewing computing as regurgitation and production of a set of axiomatic computational abstractions, we argue that computing and computational thinking, should be viewed as discursive, perspectival, material and embodied experiences, among others. These experiences include, but are not subsumed by, the use and production of computational abstractions. We illustrate what this paradigmatic shift toward a more phenomenological account of computing can mean for teaching and learning STEM in K12 classrooms by presenting a critical review of the literature, as well as by presenting a review of several studies we have conducted in K12 educational settings grounded in this perspective. Our analysis reveals several phenomenological approaches that can be useful for framing computational thinking in K12 STEM classrooms.			arxiv	['Amanda Dickes', 'Amy Farris']	401.0
887	Introduction to topological quantum computation with non-Abelian anyons	Bernard Field	2018-02-17 02:56:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06176v2	Topological quantum computers promise a fault tolerant means to perform quantum computation. Topological quantum computers use particles with exotic exchange statistics called non-Abelian anyons, and the simplest anyon model which allows for universal quantum computation by particle exchange or braiding alone is the Fibonacci anyon model. One classically hard problem that can be solved efficiently using quantum computation is finding the value of the Jones polynomial of knots at roots of unity. We aim to provide a pedagogical, self-contained, review of topological quantum computation with Fibonacci anyons, from the braiding statistics and matrices to the layout of such a computer and the compiling of braids to perform specific operations. Then we use a simulation of a topological quantum computer to explicitly demonstrate a quantum computation using Fibonacci anyons, evaluating the Jones polynomial of a selection of simple knots. In addition to simulating a modular circuit-style quantum algorithm, we also show how the magnitude of the Jones polynomial at specific points could be obtained exactly using Fibonacci or Ising anyons. Such an exact algorithm seems ideally suited for a proof of concept demonstration of a topological quantum computer.			arxiv	['Tapio Simula']	402.0

It presents a new framework using discrete ODEs as a central tool for computation and provides several implicit characterizations of complexity and computability classes. The proposed framework presents an original point of view on complexity and computability classes. It also unifies in an elegant settings various constructions that have been proposed for characterizing these classes. This includes Cobham's and, Bellantoni and Cook's definition of polynomial time and later extensions on the approach, as well as recent characterizations of computability and complexity by classes of ordinary differential equations. It also helps understanding the relationships between analog computations and classical discrete models of computation theory. At a more technical point of view, this paper points out the fundamental role of linear (discrete) ordinary differential equations and classical ODE tools such as changes of variables to capture computability and complexity measures, or as a tool for programming various algorithms.			arxiv	['Arnaud Durand', 'Sabrina Ouazzani']	403.0

In order to overcome the defects of the traditional cloud computing model in the era of big data. In this article, we first propose a new AIenabled smart edge with heterogeneous IoT architecture which combines edge computing, caching, and communication. Then, we propose the Smart-Edge-CoCaCo algorithm. To minimize total delay and confirm the computation offloading decision, Smart-Edge-CoCaCo uses joint optimization of the wireless communication model, the collaborative filter caching model in edge cloud, and the computation offloading model. Finally, we built an emotion interaction testbed to perform computational delay experiments in real environments. The experiment results showed that the computation delay of the Smart-Edge-CoCaCo algorithm is lower than that of traditional cloud computing model with the increase of computing task data and the number of concurrent users.			arxiv	['Yiming Miao', 'Yuanwen Tian', 'Long Hu', 'M.

Durán	2019-03-09 15:38:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01052v1	Several philosophical issues in connection with computer simulations rely on the assumption that results of simulations are trustworthy. Examples of these include the debate on the experimental role of computer simulations \cite{Parker2009, Morrison2009}, the nature of computer data \cite{Barberousse2013, Humphreys2013}, and the explanatory power of computer simulations \cite{Krohs2008, Duran2017}. The aim of this article is to show that these authors are right in assuming that the results of computer simulations are to be trusted when computer simulations are reliable processes. After a short reconstruction of the problem of \textit{epistemic opacity}, the article elaborates extensively on \textit{computational reliabilism}, a specified form of process reliabilism with computer simulations located at the center. The article ends with a discussion of four sources for computational reliabilism, namely, verification and validation, robustness analysis for computer simulations, a history of (un)successful implementations, and the role of expert knowledge in simulations.			arxiv	['Nico Formanek']	405.0

The characteristics of mobile devices and wireless network makes the implementation of mobile cloud computing more complicated than for fixed clouds. This section lists some of the major issues in Mobile Cloud Computing. One of the key issues in mobile cloud computing is the end to end delay in servicing a request. Data caching is o ne of the techniques widely used in wired and wireless networks to improve data access efficiency.

It is likely that many users will need to rely on remote access to delegate their computation to the available hardware. In such a scenario, the privacy and reliability of the delegated computations are important concerns. On the other hand, the distributed nature of modern computations has led to a widespread class of applications in which a group of parties attempt to perform a joint task over their inputs, e.g., in cloud computing. In this paper, we study the multi-client delegated quantum computation problem where we consider the global computation be made up of local computations that are individually decided by the clients. Each client part is kept secret from the server and the other clients. We construct a composable secure multi-client delegated quantum computation scheme from any composable secure single-client delegated quantum computation protocol and quantum authentication codes.			arxiv	['Mahboobeh Houshmand', 'Si-Hui Tan', 'Joseph Fitzsimons']	407.0
893	Dynamical Privacy in Distributed Computing -- Part I: Privacy Loss and PPSC Mechanism	Yang Liu	2019-02-19 09:31:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06966v1	A distributed computing protocol consists of three components: (i) Data Localization: a network-wide dataset is decomposed into local datasets separately preserved at a network of nodes; (ii) Node Communication: the nodes hold individual dynamical states and communicate with the neighbors about these dynamical states; (iii) Local Computation: state recursions are computed at each individual node. Information about the local datasets enters the computation process through the node-to-node communication and the local computations, which may be leaked to dynamics eavesdroppers having access to global or local node states. In this paper, we systematically investigate this potential computational privacy risks in distributed computing protocols in the form of structured system identification, and then propose and thoroughly analyze a Privacy-Preserving-Summation-Consistent (PPSC) mechanism as a generic privacy encryption subroutine for consensus-based distributed computations. The central idea is that the consensus manifold is where we can both hide node privacy and achieve computational accuracy. In this first part of the paper, we demonstrate the computational privacy risks in distributed algorithms against dynamics eavesdroppers and particularly in distributed linear equation solvers, and then propose the PPSC mechanism and illustrate its usefulness.			arxiv	['Junfeng Wu', 'Ian R.

Mobile edge computing is emerging to handle the sheer volume of produced data and reach the latency demand of computation-intensive IoT applications. Although the advance of mobile edge computing on service latency is studied solidly, security and efficiency on data usage in mobile edge computing have not been clearly identified. In this article, we examine the architecture of mobile edge computing and explore the potentials of utilizing mobile edge computing to enhance data analysis for IoT applications, while achieving data security and computational efficiency. Specifically, we first introduce the overall architecture and several promising edge-assisted IoT applications. We then study the security, privacy and efficiency challenges in data processing for mobile edge computing, and discuss the opportunities to enhance data security and improve computational efficiency with the assistance of edge computing, including secure data aggregation, secure data deduplication and secure computational offloading.

In this paper, for ease of analytical analysis, we consider the homogeneous bidirectional computation task model in a mobile edge network which consists of one mobile edge computing (MEC) server and one mobile device, both enabled with computing and caching capabilities. Each task can be served via three mechanisms, i.e., local computing with local caching, local computing without local caching and computing at the MEC server. To minimize the average bandwidth, we formulate the joint caching and computing optimization problem under the latency, cache size and average power constraints. We derive the closed-form expressions for the optimal policy and the minimum bandwidth. The tradeoff among communications, computing and caching is illustrated both analytically and numerically, which provides insightful guideline for the network designers.			arxiv	['Lyutianyang Zhang', 'Zhiyong Chen', 'Sumit Roy']	410.0

We propose techniques to break the adversarial toleration threshold barrier previously known in coded computing. More specifically, we leverage list-decoding techniques for folded Reed-Solomon codes and propose novel algorithms to recover the correct codeword using side information. In the coded computing setting, we show how the master node can perform certain carefully designed extra computations to obtain the side information. The workload of computing this side information is negligible compared to the computations done by each worker. This side information is then utilized to prune the output of the list decoder and uniquely recover the true outcome. We further propose folded Lagrange coded computing (FLCC) to incorporate the developed techniques into a specific coded computing setting. Our results show that FLCC outperforms LCC by breaking the barrier on the number of adversaries that can be tolerated. In particular, the corresponding threshold in FLCC is improved by a factor of two asymptotically compared to that of LCC.			arxiv	['Ramy E. Ali', 'Hessam Mahdavifar', 'A. Salman Avestimehr']	411.0

Cloud computing provide Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) for guaranteed uptime availability for enabling convenient and on-demand network access to the distributed and shared computing resources. Though the cloud computing paradigm holds its potential status in the field of distributed computing, cloud platforms are not yet to the attention of majority of the researchers and practitioners. More specifically, still the researchers and practitioners community has fragmented and imperfect knowledge on cloud computing principles and techniques. In this context, one of the primary motivations of the work presented in this paper is to reveal the versatile merits of cloud computing paradigm and hence the objective of this work is defined to bring out the remarkable significances of cloud computing paradigm through an application environment.

One answer, endorsed here, is that computing is about programming a system to behave in different ways. This paper offers an account of what it means for a physical system to compute based on this notion. It proposes a behavioural characterisation of computing in terms of a measure of programmability, which reflects a system's ability to react to external stimuli. The proposed measure of programmability is useful for classifying computers in terms of the apparent algorithmic complexity of their evolution in time. I make some specific proposals in this connection and discuss this approach in the context of other behavioural approaches, notably Turing's test of machine intelligence. I also anticipate possible objections and consider the applicability of these proposals to the task of relating abstract computation to nature-like computation.			arxiv	[]	413.0

To this end, numerical accuracies and computational work of several numerical methods are compared using a GPU computing implementation. The Correction Procedure via Reconstruction (CPR), Discontinuous Galerkin (DG), Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin (NDG), Spectral Difference (SD), and Finite Volume (FV) methods are investigated using various reconstruction orders. Both smooth and discontinuous cases are considered for two-dimensional simulations. For discontinuous problems, MUSCL schemes are employed with FV, while CPR, DG, NDG, and SD use slope limiting. The computation time to reach a set error criteria and total time to complete solutions are compared across the methods. It is shown that while FV methods can produce solutions with low computational times, they produce larger errors than high-order methods for smooth problems at the same order of accuracy. For discontinuous problems, the methods show good agreement with one another in terms of solution profiles, and the total computational times between FV, CPR, and SD are comparable.			arxiv	['Jonathan D.

Barik	2017-12-27 18:19:25	http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09645v1	The present manuscript concentrates on the application of Fog computing to a Smart Grid Network that comprises of a Distribution Generation System known as a Microgrid. It addresses features and advantages of a smart grid. Two computational methods for on-demand processing based on shared information resources is discussed. Fog Computing acts as an additional layer of computational and/or communication nodes that offload the Cloud backend from multi-tasking while dealing with large amounts of data. Both Fog computing and Cloud computing hierarchical architecture is compared with respect to efficient utilization of resources. To alleviate the advantages of Fog computing, a Fog computing framework based on Intel Edison is proposed. The proposed architecture has been hardware implemented for a microgrid system. The results obtained show the efficacy of Fog Computing for smart grid network in terms of low power consumption, reduced storage requirement and overlay analysis capabilities.			arxiv	['Satish Kumar Gudey', 'Gujji Giridhar Reddy', 'Meenakshi Pant', 'Harishchandra Dubey', 'Kunal Mankodiya', 'Vinay Kumar']	417.0
903	Gradient Coding with Clustering and Multi-message Communication	Emre Ozfatura	2019-03-05 18:38:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01974v1	Gradient descent (GD) methods are commonly employed in machine learning problems to optimize the parameters of the model in an iterative fashion. For problems with massive datasets, computations are distributed to many parallel computing servers (i.e., workers) to speed up GD iterations. While distributed computing can increase the computation speed significantly, the per-iteration completion time is limited by the slowest straggling workers. Coded distributed computing can mitigate straggling workers by introducing redundant computations; however, existing coded computing schemes are mainly designed against persistent stragglers, and partial computations at straggling workers are discarded, leading to wasted computational capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel gradient coding (GC) scheme which allows multiple coded computations to be conveyed from each worker to the master per iteration. We numerically show that the proposed GC with multi-message communication (MMC) together with clustering provides significant improvements in the average completion time (of each iteration), with minimal or no increase in the communication load.			arxiv	['Deniz Gunduz', 'Sennur Ulukus']	418.0

In order to have a better perception of the computing jobs and their requests of resources, we analyze its characteristics and focus on the prediction and classification of the computing jobs with some machine learning approaches. Specifically, we apply LSTM neural network to predict the arrival of the jobs and the aggregated requests for computing resources. Then we evaluate it on Google Cluster dataset and it shows that the accuracy has been improved compared to the current existing methods. Additionally, to have a better understanding of the computing jobs, we use an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm, BIRCH, to make classification and get some interpretability of our results in the computing centers.			arxiv	['Pingyi Fan']	419.0

In this paper, we (a) develop results in modal metaphysics whose discovery was computer assisted, and (b) conclude that these results work not only to the obvious benefit of philosophy but also, less obviously, to the benefit of computer science, since the new computational techniques that led to these results may be more broadly applicable within computer science.

906	Computing Haar Measures	Arno Pauly	2019-06-28 13:48:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.12220v2	According to Haar's Theorem, every compact group $G$ admits a unique (regular, right and) left-invariant Borel probability measure $\mu_G$. Let the Haar integral (of $G$) denote the functional $\int_G:\mathcal{C}(G)\ni f\mapsto \int f\,d\mu_G$ integrating any continuous function $f:G\to\mathbb{R}$ with respect to $\mu_G$. This generalizes, and recovers for the additive group $G=[0;1)\mod 1$, the usual Riemann integral: computable (cmp. Weihrauch 2000, Theorem 6.4.1), and of computational cost characterizing complexity class #P$_1$ (cmp. Ko 1991, Theorem 5.32). We establish that in fact every computably compact computable metric group renders the Haar integral computable: once asserting computability using an elegant synthetic argument, exploiting uniqueness in a computably compact space of probability measures; and once presenting and analyzing an explicit, imperative algorithm based on 'maximum packings' with rigorous error bounds and guaranteed convergence. Regarding computational complexity, for the groups $\mathcal{SO}(3)$ and $\mathcal{SU}(2)$ we reduce the Haar integral to and from Euclidean/Riemann integration. In particular both also characterize #P$_1$. Implementation and empirical evaluation using the iRRAM C++ library for exact real computation confirms the (thus necessary) exponential runtime.			arxiv	['Dongseong Seon', 'Martin Ziegler']	421.0

We design a mechanism called the Minimal Refereed Mechanism (MRM) such that if the verifier has $O(\log S + \log T)$ time and $O(\log S + \log T)$ space computation power, then both provers will provide a honest result without the verifier putting any effort to verify the results. The amount of computation required for the provers (and thus the cost) is a multiplicative $\log S$-factor more than the computation itself, making this schema efficient especially for low-space computations.			arxiv	['Chris Peikert', 'Grant Schoenebeck', 'Biaoshuai Tao']	422.0
908	Computational Resource Allocation for Edge Computing in Social Internet-of-Things	Abdullah Khanfor	2020-07-08 05:14:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03904v1	The heterogeneity of the Internet-of-things (IoT) network can be exploited as a dynamic computational resource environment for many devices lacking computational capabilities. A smart mechanism for allocating edge and mobile computers to match the need of devices requesting external computational resources is developed. In this paper, we employ the concept of Social IoT and machine learning to downgrade the complexity of allocating appropriate edge computers. We propose a framework that detects different communities of devices in SIoT enclosing trustworthy peers having strong social relations. Afterwards, we train a machine learning algorithm, considering multiple computational and non-computational features of the requester as well as the edge computers, to predict the total time needed to process the required task by the potential candidates belonging to the same community of the requester. By applying it to a real-world data set, we observe that the proposed framework provides encouraging results for mobile computer allocation.			arxiv	['Raby Hamadi', 'Hakim Ghazzai', 'Ye Yang', 'Mohammad R.

909	A Fast and Calibrated Computer Model Emulator: An Empirical Bayes Approach	Vojtech Kejzlar	2020-08-11 22:26:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05021v2	Mathematical models implemented on a computer have become the driving force behind the acceleration of the cycle of scientific processes. This is because computer models are typically much faster and economical to run than physical experiments. In this work, we develop an empirical Bayes approach to predictions of physical quantities using a computer model, where we assume that the computer model under consideration needs to be calibrated and is computationally expensive. We propose a Gaussian process emulator and a Gaussian process model for the systematic discrepancy between the computer model and the underlying physical process. This allows for closed-form and easy-to-compute predictions given by a conditional distribution induced by the Gaussian processes. We provide a rigorous theoretical justification of the proposed approach by establishing posterior consistency of the estimated physical process. The computational efficiency of the methods is demonstrated in an extensive simulation study and a real data example. The newly established approach makes enhanced use of computer models both from practical and theoretical standpoints.			arxiv	['Mookyong Son', 'Shrijita Bhattacharya', 'Tapabrata Maiti']	424.0
910	Do Reservoir Computers Work Best at the Edge of Chaos?	Thomas L. Carroll	2020-12-02 18:57:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01409v1	"It has been demonstrated that cellular automata had the highest computational capacity at the edge of chaos, the parameter at which their behavior transitioned from ordered to chaotic. This same concept has been applied to reservoir computers; a number of researchers have stated that the highest computational capacity for a reservoir computer is at the edge of chaos, although others have suggested that this rule is not universally true. Because many reservoir computers do not show chaotic behavior but merely become unstable, it is felt that a more accurate term for this instability transition is the ""edge of stability""Here I find two examples where the computational capacity of a reservoir computer decreases as the edge of stability is approached; in one case, because generalized synchronization breaks down, and in the other case because the reservoir computer is a poor match to the problem being solved. The edge of stability as an optimal operating point for a reservoir computer is not in general true, although it may be true in some cases."			arxiv	[]	425.0
911	WISE: A Computer System Performance Index Scoring Framework	Lorenzo Luciano	2020-12-14 22:36:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07984v1	The performance levels of a computing machine running a given workload configuration are crucial for both users and providers of computing resources. Knowing how well a computing machine is running with a given workload configuration is critical to making proper computing resource allocation decisions. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for deriving computing machine and computing resource performance indicators for a given workload configuration. We propose a workload/machine index score (WISE) framework for computing a fitness score for a workload/machine combination. The WISE score indicates how well a computing machine is running with a specific workload configuration by addressing the issue of whether resources are being stressed or sitting idle wasting precious resources. In addition to encompassing any number of computing resources, the WISE score is determined by considering how far from target levels the machine resources are operating at without maxing out. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed WISE framework on two distinct workload configurations.			arxiv	['Imre Kiss', 'Peter William Beardshear', 'Esther Kadosh', 'A.

912	Multi-Matrix Verifiable Computation	Yan He	2021-04-30 09:10:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14851v1	The problem of securely outsourcing computation to cloud servers has attracted a large amount of attention in recent years. The verifiable computation of Gennaro, Gentry, Parno (Crypto'10) allows a client to verify the server's computation of a function with substantially less time than performing the outsourced computation from scratch. In a multi-function model (Parno, Raykova, Vaikuntanathan; TCC'12) of verifiable computation, the process of encoding function and the process of preparing input are decoupled such that any client can freely submit a computation request on its input, without having to generate an encoding of the function in advance. In this paper, we propose a multi-matrix verifiable computation scheme that allows the secure outsourcing of the matrix functions over a finite field. Our scheme is outsourceable. When it is used to outsource $m$ linear functions, the scheme is roughly $m$ times faster and has less communication cost than the previously best known scheme by Fiore and Gennaro (CCS'12), both in the client-side computation and in the server-side computation. We also show the cost saving with detailed implementations.			arxiv	['Liang Feng Zhang']	427.0
913	Optimizing Memory in Reservoir Computers	Thomas L. Carroll	2022-01-05 13:38:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01605v1	A reservoir computer is a way of using a high dimensional dynamical system for computation. One way to construct a reservoir computer is by connecting a set of nonlinear nodes into a network. Because the network creates feedback between nodes, the reservoir computer has memory. If the reservoir computer is to respond to an input signal in a consistent way (a necessary condition for computation), the memory must be fading; that is, the influence of the initial conditions fades over time. How long this memory lasts is important for determining how well the reservoir computer can solve a particular problem. In this paper I describe ways to vary the length of the fading memory in reservoir computers. Tuning the memory can be important to achieve optimal results in some problems; too much or too little memory degrades the accuracy of the computation.			arxiv	[]	428.0
914	Towards an Antivirus for Quantum Computers	Sanjay Deshpande	2022-03-05 02:52:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02649v1	Researchers are today exploring models for cloud-based usage of quantum computers where multi-tenancy can be used to share quantum computer hardware among multiple users. Multi-tenancy has a promise of allowing better utilization of the quantum computer hardware, but also opens up the quantum computer to new types of security attacks. As this and other recent research shows, it is possible to perform a fault injection attack using crosstalk on quantum computers when a victim and attacker circuits are instantiated as co-tenants on the same quantum computer. To ensure such attacks do not happen, this paper proposes that new techniques should be developed to help catch malicious circuits before they are loaded onto quantum computer hardware. Following ideas from classical computers, a compile-time technique can be designed to scan quantum computer programs for malicious or suspicious code patterns before they are compiled into quantum circuits that run on a quantum computer. This paper presents ongoing work which demonstrates how crosstalk can affect Grover's algorithm, and then presents suggestions of how quantum programs could be analyzed to catch circuits that generate large amounts of crosstalk with malicious intent.			arxiv	['Chuanqi Xu', 'Theodoros Trochatos', 'Yongshan Ding', 'Jakub Szefer']	429.0

Due to the high computational complexity in conventional digital computers, matrix computation represents a heavy workload in many data-intensive applications, e.g., machine learning, scientific computing, and wireless communications. For fast, efficient matrix computations, analog computing with resistive memory arrays has been proven to be a promising solution. In this Tutorial, we present analog matrix computing (AMC) circuits based on crosspoint resistive memory arrays. AMC circuits are able to carry out basic matrix computations, including matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, pseudoinverse and eigenvector computation, all with one single operation. We describe the main design principles of the AMC circuits, such as local/global or negative/positive feedback configurations, with/without external inputs. Mapping strategies for matrices containing negative values will be presented. The underlying requirements for circuit stability will be described via the transfer function analysis, which also defines time complexity of the circuits towards steady-state results. Lastly, typical applications, challenges, and future trends of AMC circuits will be discussed.			arxiv	['Daniele Ielmini']	430.0

917	How (and Why) to Think that the Brain is Literally a Computer	Corey J. Maley	2022-08-24 15:38:10	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12032v1	The relationship between brains and computers is often taken to be merely metaphorical. However, genuine computational systems can be implemented in virtually any media; thus, one can take seriously the view that brains literally compute. But without empirical criteria for what makes a physical system genuinely a computational one, computation remains a matter of perspective, especially for natural systems (e.g., brains) that were not explicitly designed and engineered to be computers. Considerations from real examples of physical computers-both analog and digital, contemporary and historical-make clear what those empirical criteria must be. Finally, applying those criteria to the brain shows how we can view the brain as a computer (probably an analog one at that), which, in turn, illuminates how that claim is both informative and falsifiable.			arxiv	[]	432.0
918	How many inner simulations to compute conditional expectations with least-square Monte Carlo?	Aurélien Alfonsi	2022-09-09 07:22:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04153v2	The problem of computing the conditional expectation E[f (Y)|X] with least-square Monte-Carlo is of general importance and has been widely studied. To solve this problem, it is usually assumed that one has as many samples of Y as of X. However, when samples are generated by computer simulation and the conditional law of Y given X can be simulated, it may be relevant to sample K $\in$ N values of Y for each sample of X. The present work determines the optimal value of K for a given computational budget, as well as a way to estimate it. The main take away message is that the computational gain can be all the more important that the computational cost of sampling Y given X is small with respect to the computational cost of sampling X. Numerical illustrations on the optimal choice of K and on the computational gain are given on different examples including one inspired by risk management.			arxiv	['Bernard Lapeyre', 'Jérôme Lelong']	433.0
919	Gender Bias in Computing	Thomas J. Misa	2022-10-29 00:10:25	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16449v1	This paper examines the historical dimension of gender bias in the US computing workforce. It offers new quantitative data on the computing workforce prior to the availability of US Census data in the 1970s. Computer user groups (including SHARE, Inc., and the Mark IV software user group) are taken as a cross-section of the computing workforce. A novel method of gender analysis is developed to estimate women's and men's participation in computing beginning in the 1950s. The data presented here are consistent with well-known NSF statistics that show computer science undergraduate programs enrolling increasing numbers of women students during 1965-1985. These findings challenge the 'making programming masculine' thesis, and serve to correct the unrealistically high figures often cited for women's participation in early computer programming. Gender bias in computing today is traced not to 1960s professionalization but to cultural changes in the 1980s and beyond.			arxiv	[]	434.0

We estimate a model, informed by work on neural scaling laws, and infer a decomposition of progress into the scaling of compute, data, and algorithms. Using Shapley values to attribute performance improvements, we find that algorithmic improvements have been roughly as important as the scaling of compute for progress computer vision. Our estimates indicate that algorithmic innovations mostly take the form of compute-augmenting algorithmic advances (which enable researchers to get better performance from less compute), not data-augmenting algorithmic advances. We find that compute-augmenting algorithmic advances are made at a pace more than twice as fast as the rate usually associated with Moore's law. In particular, we estimate that compute-augmenting innovations halve compute requirements every nine months (95\% confidence interval: 4 to 25 months).			arxiv	['Tamay Besiroglu']	435.0

This article presents a unified computation model with generalized expression ability and a concise set of primitive operators for programming high-level algorithms. We propose a unified data abstraction -- Tensor of List, and offer a unified computation model based on Tensor of List, which we call the ToL model (in short, ToL). ToL introduces five atomic computations that can represent any elementary computation by finite composition, ensured with strict formal proof. Based on ToL, we design a pure-functional language -- ToLang. ToLang provides a concise set of primitive operators that can be used to program complex big data and AI algorithms. Our evaluations show ToL has generalized expression ability and a built-in performance indicator, born with a strictly defined computation metric -- elementary operation count (EOPs), consistent with FLOPs within a small error range.			arxiv	['Wanling Gao', 'Lei Wang', 'Jianfeng Zhan']	436.0

This article provides a systematic review and comparison of TEE-based secure computation protocols. We first propose a taxonomy that classifies secure computation protocols into three major categories, namely secure outsourced computation, secure distributed computation and secure multi-party computation. To enable a fair comparison of these protocols, we also present comprehensive assessment criteria with respect to four aspects: setting, methodology, security and performance. Based on these criteria, we review, discuss and compare the state-of-the-art TEE-based secure computation protocols for both general-purpose computation functions and special-purpose ones, such as privacy-preserving machine learning and encrypted database queries. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first survey to review TEE-based secure computation protocols and the comprehensive comparison can serve as a guideline for selecting suitable protocols for deployment in practice. Finally, we also discuss several future research directions and challenges.			arxiv	['Bowen Zhao', 'Guomin Yang', 'Tao Xiang', 'Jian Weng', 'Robert H. Deng']	437.0

This is already more than emissions from the airline industry and are projected to rise steeply over the next two decades. By 2040 emissions from computing alone will account for more than half of the emissions budget to keep global warming below 1.5$^\circ$C. Consequently, this growth in computing emissions is unsustainable. The emissions from production of computing devices exceed the emissions from operating them, so even if devices are more energy efficient producing more of them will make the emissions problem worse. Therefore we must extend the useful life of our computing devices. As a society we need to start treating computational resources as finite and precious, to be utilised only when necessary, and as effectively as possible. We need frugal computing: achieving our aims with less energy and material.			arxiv	[]	438.0

We show how to use slope criteria for the sheaf of syzygies for generators of the ideal to compute the tight closure. Our method gives in particular an algorithm to compute the tight closure of three elements under the condition that we are able to compute the Harder-Narasimhan filtration. We apply this to the computation of (x^a,y^a,z^a)^* in K[x,y,z]/(F), where F is a homogeneous polynomial.			arxiv	[]	446.0
932	Computing Modular Polynomials	Denis Charles	2004-08-03 23:55:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0408051v2	We present a new probabilistic algorithm to compute modular polynomials modulo a prime. Modular polynomials parameterize pairs of isogenous elliptic curves and are useful in many aspects of computational number theory and cryptography. Our algorithm has the distinguishing feature that it does not involve the computation of Fourier coefficients of modular forms. We avoid computing the exponentially large integral coefficients by working directly modulo a prime and computing isogenies between elliptic curves via Velu's formulas.			arxiv	['Kristin Lauter']	447.0
933	The computation of Kostka Numbers and Littlewood-Richardson Coefficients is #P-complete	Hariharan Narayanan	2005-01-12 00:51:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0501176v1	Kostka numbers and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients play an essential role in the representation theory of the symmetric groups and the special linear groups. There has been a significant amount of interest in their computation. The issue of their computational complexity has been a question of folklore, but was asked explicitly by E. Rassart. We prove that the computation of either quantity is #P-complete. The reduction to computing Kostka numbers, is from the #P-complete problem of counting the number of 2 x k contingency tables having given row and column sums. The main ingredient in this reduction is a correspondence discovered by D. E. Knuth. The reduction to the problem of computing Littlewood-Richardson coefficients is from that of computing Kostka numbers.			arxiv	[]	448.0

Through simulation of physical models of quantum computer hardware, we analyze the difficulties that are encountered in programming physical realizations of quantum computers. Examples of logically identical implementations of the controlled-NOT operation and Grover's database search algorithm are used to demonstrate that the results of a quantum computation are unstable with respect to the physical realization of the quantum computer.

939	Fault-Tolerant Postselected Quantum Computation: Schemes	E. Knill	2004-02-23 22:15:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402171v1	Postselected quantum computation is distinguished from regular quantum computation by accepting the output only if measurement outcomes satisfy predetermined conditions. The output must be accepted with nonzero probability. Methods for implementing postselected quantum computation with noisy gates are proposed. These methods are based on error-detecting codes. Conditionally on detecting no errors, it is expected that the encoded computation can be made to be arbitrarily accurate. Although the probability of success of the encoded computation decreases dramatically with accuracy, it is possible to apply the proposed methods to the problem of preparing arbitrary stabilizer states in large error-correcting codes with local residual errors. Together with teleported error-correction, this may improve the error tolerance of non-postselected quantum computation.			arxiv	[]	454.0
940	Non-Computability of Consciousness	Daegene Song	2007-05-11 10:16:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1617v1	With the great success in simulating many intelligent behaviors using computing devices, there has been an ongoing debate whether all conscious activities are computational processes. In this paper, the answer to this question is shown to be no. A certain phenomenon of consciousness is demonstrated to be fully represented as a computational process using a quantum computer. Based on the computability criterion discussed with Turing machines, the model constructed is shown to necessarily involve a non-computable element. The concept that this is solely a quantum effect and does not work for a classical case is also discussed.			arxiv	[]	455.0

Yanofsky	2007-08-02 02:50:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0261v1	Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of mathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum mechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle introduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by motivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with simple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small fraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic quantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and quantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the simplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch's algorithm. Our presentation demands neither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.			arxiv	[]	457.0

To do this, we first develop a unified framework allowing computations with probability measures. We show that any computable metric space with a computable probability measure is isomorphic to the Cantor space in a computable and measure-theoretic sense. We show that any computable metric space admits a universal uniform randomness test (without further assumption).			arxiv	['Cristobal Rojas']	458.0

A good representation of compact sets provides an efficient means of creating and displaying images with a computer. In this paper, I build upon existing work about complete metric spaces to define compact sets as the completion of the space of finite sets under the Hausdorff metric. This definition allowed me to quickly develop a computer verified theory of compact sets. I applied this theory to compute provably correct plots of uniformly continuous functions.			arxiv	[]	459.0

Childs	2008-12-02 14:05:19	http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0380v1	Quantum computers can execute algorithms that dramatically outperform classical computation. As the best-known example, Shor discovered an efficient quantum algorithm for factoring integers, whereas factoring appears to be difficult for classical computers. Understanding what other computational problems can be solved significantly faster using quantum algorithms is one of the major challenges in the theory of quantum computation, and such algorithms motivate the formidable task of building a large-scale quantum computer. This article reviews the current state of quantum algorithms, focusing on algorithms with superpolynomial speedup over classical computation, and in particular, on problems with an algebraic flavor.			arxiv	['Wim van Dam']	460.0

949	Discrete analogue computing with rotor-routers	James Propp	2010-07-14 18:20:10	http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2389v2	Rotor-routing is a procedure for routing tokens through a network that can implement certain kinds of computation. These computations are inherently asynchronous (the order in which tokens are routed makes no difference) and distributed (information is spread throughout the system). It is also possible to efficiently check that a computation has been carried out correctly in less time than the computation itself required, provided one has a certificate that can itself be computed by the rotor-router network. Rotor-router networks can be viewed as both discrete analogues of continuous linear systems and deterministic analogues of stochastic processes.			arxiv	[]	464.0

As an typical example to support our perspectives on quantum computation, we study quantum computing in one-dimensional nonrelativistic system with delta-function interaction, where the two-body scattering matrix satisfies the factorisation equation (the quantum Yang--Baxter equation) and acts as a parametric two-body quantum gate. We conclude by comparing quantum computing via the factorisable scattering with topological quantum computing.			arxiv	[]	466.0

For various reasons, we sometimes want to reveal the internals of a computation. To make that possible, in this paper we introduce monad transformers that add the ability to automatically accumulate observations about the course of execution as an effect. We discover that if we treat the resulting trace as the actual result of the computation, we can find new functionality in existing monads, notably when working with non-terminating computations.			arxiv	['Jeremy Gibbons']	467.0

In the literature, there exist various algorithms for computing the homology groups of simplicial complexes but concerning the algorithmic treatment of cohomology operations, very little is known. In this paper, we establish a version of the incremental algorithm for computing homology which saves algebraic information, allowing us the computation of the cup product and the effective evaluation of the primary and secondary cohomology operations on the cohomology of a finite simplicial complex. We study the computational complexity of these processes and a program in Mathematica for cohomology computations is presented.			arxiv	['Pedro Real']	468.0

It is known that a client who has only a measurement device can perform blind quantum computing [T. Morimae and K. Fujii, Phys. Rev. A {\bf87}, 050301(R) (2013)]. It has been an open problem whether the protocol can enjoy the verification, i.e., the ability of client to check the correctness of the computing.

Tailoring the microarchitecture of each compute engine to the subset of the ISA that it supports can easily reduce hardware complexity. At the same time, the energy efficiency of computing can improve by exploiting algorithmic noise tolerance: by mapping code sequences that can tolerate (any potential inaccuracy induced by) the incomplete ISA-subsets to the corresponding compute engines.			arxiv	['Jesus Alastruey-Benede', 'Dario Suarez-Gracia', 'Ulya R.

Furthermore, the number of computationally weak devices have increased drastically in recent years due to the ongoing realization of the Internet of Things. This work proposes a solution which enjoys the following two desirable properties: (1) cost of input preparation and verification is very low (low enough to allow verifiable outsourcing of computations by resource-constrained devices on constrained networks); (2) the running time of the verifiable computation is RAM-like.			arxiv	[]	489.0
975	A stochastic computing architecture for iterative estimation	Michael Lunglmayr	2018-10-31 15:03:54	http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13322v1	Stochastic computing (SC) is a promising candidate for fault tolerant computing in digital circuits. We present a novel stochastic computing estimation architecture allowing to solve a large group of estimation problems including least squares estimation as well as sparse estimation. This allows utilizing the high fault tolerance of stochastic computing for implementing estimation algorithms. The presented architecture is based on the recently proposed linearized-Bregman-based Sparse Kaczmarz algorithm. To realize this architecture, we develop a shrink function in stochastic computing and analytically describe its error probability. We compare the stochastic computing architecture to a fixed-point binary implementation and present bit-true simulation results as well as synthesis results demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed architecture for practical implementation.			arxiv	['Daniel Wiesinger', 'Werner Haselmayr']	490.0

It begins by introducing the idea of analogue computing and placing in the context of sound and music applications. This is followed by a brief examination of the classic constituents of an analogue computer, contrasting these with the typical modular voltage-controlled synthesiser. Two examples are presented, leading to a discussion on some parallels between these two technologies. This is followed by an examination of the current state-of-the-art in analogue computation and its prospects for applications in computer and electronic music.			arxiv	['Joseph Timoney']	491.0

We describe an algorithm which improves the computation of these knock out sets when the elementary modes (minimal functional subsystems) of the network are given. We also describe an algorithm which computes both the knock out sets and the elementary modes containing the blocked reactions directly from the description of the network and whose worst-case computational complexity is better than the algorithms currently in use for these problems. Computational results are included.			arxiv	['Steffen Klamt', 'Tamon Stephen']	492.0

Cell adjacency information can be used to compute topological operations e.g. closure, boundary, connected components, and topological properties e.g. homology groups. Other applications include visualization and path planning. Our algorithm determines cell adjacency information using validated numerical methods similar to those used in CAD construction, thus computing CAD with adjacency information in time comparable to that of computing CAD without adjacency information. We report on implementation of the algorithm and present empirical data.			arxiv	[]	493.0
979	Predicting the Output From a Stochastic Computer Model When a Deterministic Approximation is Available	Evan Baker	2019-02-04 16:33:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01290v1	The analysis of computer models can be aided by the construction of surrogate models, or emulators, that statistically model the numerical computer model. Increasingly, computer models are becoming stochastic, yielding different outputs each time they are run, even if the same input values are used. Stochastic computer models are more difficult to analyse and more difficult to emulate - often requiring substantially more computer model runs to fit. We present a method of using deterministic approximations of the computer model to better construct an emulator. The method is applied to numerous toy examples, as well as an idealistic epidemiology model, and a model from the building performance field.			arxiv	['Peter Challenor', 'Matt Eames']	494.0

981	Distributed Compilation System for High-Speed Software Build Processes	Geunsik Lim	2021-01-21 23:24:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08887v1	The idle time of personal computers has increased steadily due to the generalization of computer usage and cloud computing. Clustering research aims at utilizing idle computer resources for processing a variable workload on a large number of computers. The workload is processed continually despite the volatile status of the individual computer resources. This paper proposes a distributed compilation system for improving the processing speed of CPU-intensive software compilations. This significantly reduces the compilation time of mass sources by using the idle resources. We expect gains of up to 65% compared to non-distributed compilation systems.			arxiv	['Minho Lee', 'R. J.

Dragi Kimovski	2021-01-25 21:05:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10417v1	The computing continuum extends the high-performance cloud data centers with energy-efficient and low-latency devices close to the data sources located at the edge of the network. However, the heterogeneity of the computing continuum raises multiple challenges related to application management. These include where to offload an application - from the cloud to the edge - to meet its computation and communication requirements. To support these decisions, we provide in this article a detailed performance and carbon footprint analysis of a selection of use case applications with complementary resource requirements across the computing continuum over a real-life evaluation testbed.			arxiv	['Roland Mathá', 'Josef Hammer', 'Narges Mehran', 'Hermann Hellwagner', 'Radu Prodan']	497.0

Classical computational costs of assigning classical data values to quantum registers and to run-time parameters passed across a classical-to-quantum application programming interface are derived. It is shown that the classical computational costs of data definition equal or exceed the classical computational cost of solving the problem of interest for all applications of quantum computing except computations defined over the integers and the simulation of linear systems with linear boundary conditions.			arxiv	[]	498.0
984	A note on computing range space bases of rational matrices	Andreas Varga	2017-07-03 11:48:36	http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00489v2	We discuss computational procedures based on descriptor state-space realizations to compute proper range space bases of rational matrices. The main computation is the orthogonal reduction of the system matrix pencil to a special Kronecker-like form, which allows to extract a full column rank factor, whose columns form a proper rational basis of the range space. The computation of several types of bases can be easily accommodated, such as minimum-degree bases, stable inner minimum-degree bases, etc. Several straightforward applications of the range space basis computation are discussed, such as, the computation of full rank factorizations, normalized coprime factorizations, pseudo-inverses, and inner-outer factorizations.			arxiv	[]	499.0
985	Optimal broadcasting in networks with faulty nodes	Yoel Grinshpon	2017-09-14 17:18:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04885v1	Large computer networks are an essential part of modern technology, and quite often information needs to be broadcast to all the computers in the network. If all computers work perfectly all the time, this is simple. Suppose, however, that some of the computers fail occasionally. What is the fastest way to ensure that with high probability all working computers get the information? In this paper, we analyze three algorithms to do so. All algorithms terminate in logarithmic time, assuming computers fail with probability $1-p$ independently of each other. We prove that the third algorithm, which runs in time $(1+o(1))(\frac{\log N}{\log(1+p)})$, is asymptotically optimal.			arxiv	['Ori Gurel-Gurevich']	500.0
986	Trading Computation for Communication: A Taxonomy	Ismail Akturk	2017-09-18 21:59:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06555v1	A critical challenge for modern system design is meeting the overwhelming performance, storage, and communication bandwidth demand of emerging applications within a tightly bound power budget. As both the time and power, hence the energy, spent in data communication by far exceeds the energy spent in actual data generation (i.e., computation), (re)computing data can easily become cheaper than storing and retrieving (pre)computed data. Therefore, trading computation for communication can improve energy efficiency by minimizing the energy overhead incurred by data storage, retrieval, and communication. This paper hence provides a taxonomy for the computation vs. communication trade-off along with quantitative characterization.			arxiv	['Ulya R. Karpuzcu']	501.0

This concept is termed as mist computing. We believe this computing will bring about an massive revolution in future computing technologies. instead of thrusting the control responsibility to gateways while data transmission the control is decentralised to end nodes which decrease the communicational delay of the network thereby increasing the throughput.			arxiv	['K.

Driven by the recent public auction of a work of `AI Art' we selectively summarise many decades of research and commentary around topics of autonomy, authenticity, authorship and intention in computer generated art, and use this research to answer contemporary questions often asked about art made by computers that concern these topics. We additionally reflect on whether current techniques in deep learning and Generative Adversarial Networks significantly change the answers provided by many decades of prior research.			arxiv	['Toby Gifford', 'Patrick Hutchings']	503.0

In other cases, these spectra may be characterized by the ability to enumerate an arbitrary $\Sigma^0_2$ set. This is the first proof that a computable field can fail to have a computable copy with a computable transcendence basis.			arxiv	['Russell Miller', 'Hans Schoutens']	504.0

Most of the modern computing is serial and contributes to the global footprint of energy consumption. These impacts are often witnessed and experienced in many server farms and cloud computing platforms where the majority of the world's information resides. Evidently in this paper we present a novel strategy that can help decelerate the global footprint of energy consumption caused by computing. Through our strategy we prove that by adopting HAMA and utilizing safe parallelism energy consumption per computation can be minimized.			arxiv	['Michael Esiefarienrhe', 'Naison Gasela', 'Lucia Letlonkane']	505.0

Considered are approximate Bayesian computation for Bayesian inference, and Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization for likelihood inference. Up to Monte Carlo error, inference from these algorithms is exact with respect to the joint specification of both the analyst's original data model, and the curator's differential privacy mechanism. Highlighted is a duality between approximate computation on exact data, and exact computation on approximate data, which can be leveraged by a well-designed computational procedure for statistical inference.			arxiv	[]	506.0
992	How to Compute Using Quantum Walks	Viv Kendon	2020-04-03 01:51:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01329v1	Quantum walks are widely and successfully used to model diverse physical processes. This leads to computation of the models, to explore their properties. Quantum walks have also been shown to be universal for quantum computing. This is a more subtle result than is often appreciated, since it applies to computations run on qubit-based quantum computers in the single walker case, and physical quantum walks in the multi-walker case (quantum cellular automata). Nonetheless, quantum walks are powerful tools for quantum computing when correctly applied. In this paper, I explain the relationship between quantum walks as models and quantum walks as computational tools, and give some examples of their application in both contexts.			arxiv	[]	507.0

One of many benefits would be preparation for computational research.

Yet how can there be confidence that the computer code is faithful to the intentions of the parties? To understand the depth and subtlety of this question requires an exploration of natural and computer languages, of the semantics of expressions in those languages, and of the gap that exists between the disciplines of law and computer science. Here we provide a perspective on some of the key issues, explore some current research directions, and explain the importance of language design in the development of reliable Smart Contracts, including the specific methodology of Computable Contracts.			arxiv	[]	510.0
996	Modeling Precomputation In Games Played Under Computational Constraints	Thomas Orton	2021-05-19 14:06:46	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09145v1	Understanding the properties of games played under computational constraints remains challenging. For example, how do we expect rational (but computationally bounded) players to play games with a prohibitively large number of states, such as chess? This paper presents a novel model for the precomputation (preparing moves in advance) aspect of computationally constrained games. A fundamental trade-off is shown between randomness of play, and susceptibility to precomputation, suggesting that randomization is necessary in games with computational constraints. We present efficient algorithms for computing how susceptible a strategy is to precomputation, and computing an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium of our model. Numerical experiments measuring the trade-off between randomness and precomputation are provided for Stockfish (a well-known chess playing algorithm).			arxiv	[]	511.0

However, quantum computing in general is any computation accomplished by the exploitation of quantum properties of physical quantities, discrete or otherwise. It has been shown that physical quantities with continuous eigenvalue spectrum can be used for quantum computing as well. Currently, continuous variable quantum computing is a rapidly developing field both theoretically and experimentally. In this pedagogical introduction we present the basic theoretical concepts behind it and the tools for algorithm development. The paper targets readers with discrete quantum computing background, who are new to continuous variable quantum computing.			arxiv	['Robin Coleman', 'Hayk Sargsyan']	512.0

We study this problem in the context of algorithmic randomness, introducing a new notion -- almost everywhere computable randomness. A binary sequence $X$ is a.e.\ computably random if there is no probabilistic computable strategy which is total and succeeds on $X$ for positive measure of oracles. Using the fireworks technique we construct a sequence which is partial computably random but not a.e.\ computably random. We also prove the separation between a.e.\ computable randomness and partial computable randomness, which happens exactly in the uniformly almost everywhere dominating Turing degrees.			arxiv	['Valentino Delle Rose', 'Tomasz Steifer']	514.0
