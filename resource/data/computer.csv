1	PSU cable loose PC doesn't work	Unknown	2024-01-10 15:15:47	https://www.reddit.com/r/computer/comments/193aknk/psu_cable_loose_pc_doesnt_work/	Hi i bought a CPU maybe 3 years ago, and since then the PSU cable was loose, crackling and doesn't seem to fit all the way in, maybe half an inch of the PSU socket still showing, but at that time when put in right position it worked, been working for 3 years, but now i came home and PC doesn't start, it started for like a second when i first tried to move with the cable but since than after 2 hours of me wiggleing it and trying to start the PC, nothing, i think the time had come and i have to do something with it, my question is, should i take it to the repair shop to get looked on by profesionals, or is there any easy fix i could do on my own? Is there more PSU cable types and i just have the one not being the one i should have? Did i just got a bad cable or bad CPU? Could i just change the socket in my CPU maybe take it to the professionals to do it for me? Or is the problem somewhere else I'm not seeing. Sorry for my English I'm not native. Thanks.	3.0	t3_193aknk	reddit		
2	Display is pitch black - water damage?? Macbook - pls help..	Unknown	2024-01-10 15:58:03	https://www.reddit.com/r/computer/comments/193bk23/display_is_pitch_black_water_damage_macbook_pls/	"If anyone can help, pls do, I have exams next week and a billion assignments.. Last night at around 9:30-10pm (ish) I spilled tea on my computer, I instantly flipped it upside down and dried it with a microfibre towel because I thought it was only on the surface and kept using it for a little under an hour I think (stupid, I know but I had an assignment due). Then I left to go to the bathroom and just when I came back, I saw it turn off and so did the monitor I had it connected to. I thought it just went into sleep mode but when I tried to wake it up, the monitor would turn on and not my laptop screen. I was using extended display, so I was using the laptop and monitor at the same time. After the monitor turned on, I was able to use the laptop and monitor as I was before just that my laptop display was pitch black. I have the touchbar on my mac and there was a display on that too. I tried to unplug everything and turn it on but it wouldn't. Then I left it upside down in a ""tent"" position at around 11:30pm and went to sleep. In the morning I tried to turn it on again, this was at around 9am. It still wouldn't turn on, it would just make that start-up sound. Then I put it back in the tent position and went to school. I tried to turn it on again at 4pm but it wouldn't turn on, so I connected it to the monitor again. Only this time, the monitor is the primary display although my laptop is open, just like before. I haven't changed any settings. I am able to use the touchbar and the keyboard like normal, the only thing not working is the display. Has my laptop display just conked out and is there a way to turn it back on?? or am I screwed.."	2.0	t3_193bk23	reddit		
3	Mini PC will no longer boot (explanation+video)	Unknown	2024-01-10 15:52:23	https://v.redd.it/8dfu8dmswmbc1	Ive had this AcePC miniPC for a couple years now. And for the past few weeks it would just shut itself off when I wasn't using it.I made sure auto-sleep/hibernate we're not on. It would force me to reboot. At first it would reboot immediately. Then it would only reboot on the 2nd or 3rd try . Now it won't reboot at all. Last night I replaced the CMOS battery because it was dead (I checked it with a battery tester). I thought that would do the trick. It attempts to turn on. The fan starts up. And then it just gives up as you can see in the video. What's happening here?	2.0	t3_193bfd9	reddit

Usually the lines are green and dissappear when I move the cursor over them. I have updated my driver's, scanned for viruses and checked if the monitor was plugged in properly. I have restored it to before updates, and that didn't fix it. I've tried a tutorial of deleting a driver, and had to restore the pc with windows.

Initally I built it so that I could run 1440p at a decent rate. But even running in 1080, everything feels clunky. Games are running worse than before with significant stuttering, I have random issues when starting up games like tarkov or rocket league where they run SUPER BAD (like 5 fps) but if i alt tab out and back in they work fine. Steps I have taken to fix: reinstall windows (even installed windows 11 which was worse) turn on resizable bar bought more ram (used to run 32 gb) to see if it was faulty memory reseated all parts on pc minus cpu and m.2 storage made sure all windows and driver updates were installed. I just am at a loss for what to do at this point. I have looked up countless forums, and tried everything under the sun to fix this and im getting desperate. I am willing to offer more info to any questions as needed, but if someone can help me, I would be forever grateful. I just wanna play games man.	5.0	t3_192nsoc	reddit

42	Bit of an odd problem I get at least once a week, possibly with my display settings?	Unknown	2024-01-09 00:36:09	https://v.redd.it/6eo3o75f8bbc1	Recently bought an ASUS Zenbook flip 15 (2-in-1 touchscreen laptop). Every once in a while out of nowhere my screen will go black, and the symbols regarding to I believe display settings/monitor position will flash in the upper left hand corner over and over. Almost as if it believes I have a monitor connected and is spazzing. Sometimes this WILL happen when I connect to or disconnect from my monitor but originally and most of the time it happens when there is nothing plugged into my laptop. Usually I have to restart the laptop to get in but sometimes I’m able to get the black screen and flashing symbols to stop by clicking esc or f11. Either way if I don’t restart the laptop, everything is minimized as if my screen scaling is tiny. Any ideas on the cause and what the fix may be?	7.0	t3_19214cc	reddit

I plan on upgrading the CPU and motherboard in a few, but I would like the computer to work now. It won't post with the rx 7600, which I just got 5 days ago, and it was running fine in for that time. Now everytime the rx 7600 is inside the computer it only posts rarely, like 10% of the time, I have to keep restarting it to get it to post. When I put my old GTX 1070 in, the computer posts fine. I tested the gpu on another computer, and it posted instantly every time, so it's not the GPU. Another thing to note is that now, ever since this started, the computer won't post if the first ram slot is filled, making me have 8gb less ram. When I have the first ram slot inactive, and the Gtx 1070 in, it boots like normal, but with the first ram slot inactive, and the RX 7600 in the computer, it will not boot or extremely extremely rarely. I went crazy unplugging different things, and it's not the CPU, since it posts, Is it possible the motherboard is just failing and on it's way out?	2.0	t3_191i9y3	reddit

After resetting, I have immediately ran into two problems I did not have previously. Just to mention it, I did a reset removing all personal files and reinstalled windows from the computer itself. Anyway, my computer is using a different timezone from where I live, and I can’t change it. My location is on, and whenever I turn on “automatically change timezone” in the settings I get a notification asking if I want to use the corrrect timezone, and to press accept if thats fine, but when I press accept it does absolutely nothing. I have tried various times clicking in different spots, but nothing. I also tried navigating to the change time zone settings in the control panel, to which I’m greeted with an error saying I do not have permission to do the task of changing my time zone. How do I get it to switch, or is this something my computer may sort out since I only reset it yesterday? And since reseting my windows security opens to a blank screen, and I have shut it down, and restarting it various times but the app doesn’t open. When I reinstalled windows I did not have an third party antivirus either since I did not keep any files, though I have installed mcafee since. But windows security did this when mcafee was not installed. And I never had this issue with Windows Security prior to restarting. What do I do to fix it, or may it sort itself out in time? My account is administrator, but under 18 if that means anything. And it is the only user on the device. On a sidenote, I don’t really know much about computers and I really want to avoid running commands or messing with registry, I don’t know what I’m doing.

79	Surface Pro Battery Replacement	Unknown	2024-01-07 18:29:03	https://i.redd.it/19r0sloz92bc1.png	I just did a battery replacement on a Surface Pro 5 (1796) against my better judgement. I used a heat gun to warm up the adhesive holding the screen to the back which was a pain. I did notice some small cracks growing like a crystal tree formation in a couple spots which came when I heated a spot for too long. I chugged a long thinking I'd be okay with a few cracks and didn't think to turn it on when I got the screen off. Anyway, I replaced the battery and plugged everything back in and turned it on and this is one I'm getting. Before I tried the battery replacement, it worked perfectly but had to be plugged in to use. I'm assuming the screen is toast now and I'll need a new one, but I wanted to ask here first to see if maybe you guys know if this is a symptom of a different hardware issue. I got the Surface for free, spent $40 on a new battery, but I'm not sure if it's worth an extra $100 to get a screen replacement. And even if I do, will this fix the problem or did I mess something else up? Thanks for your help and recommendations!

I read that my board literally has a D.O.C.P on the main screen which I didn't even notice the first time I did this. So that option remained on disable when manually setting my speed to 2400 the first time. This time though just restarting my computer and setting my D.O.C.P from disabled to its profile 1, i restarted my computer and fails to get to log in.

89	[Need Help] Weird Black Screen Issue While Gaming	Unknown	2024-01-07 11:55:07	https://www.reddit.com/r/computer/comments/190qkye/need_help_weird_black_screen_issue_while_gaming/	Hello everyone, I've stumbled upon this funky problem lately. Specifically, I have been experiencing a recurrent black screen phenomenon during gaming sessions on my PC. It is noteworthy that, peculiarly, the monitor remains active during these instances and does not power down. This anomaly appears exclusively when I play a videogame, as it is not happenning during routine internet browsing and video streaming activities. When the screen momentarily going dark, there are no any associated error messages or system crashes. It is essential to mention that this issue does not manifest on a regular frequency; rather, it exhibits an irregular pattern. At times, it may occur as frequently as five times within a five-minute span, while in other instances, it might only transpire once in an hour. Remarkably, following each occurrence, the screen spontaneously returns to normal, allowing for the resumption of gameplay without further hindrance. To address this matter, I have undertaken a thorough examination and implementation of troubleshooting measures, inclusive of the most recent updates to graphic drivers. For comprehensive understanding and potential assistance, the pertinent details of my system configuration are as follows: * GPU: AMD Radeon RX6700 * CPU: Intel Core i5-12400F * RAM: 16.0 GB * Monitor: BenQ EX240 (165HZ) * Operating System: Windows 11 Pro 64-bit It is important to mention that all graphic drivers are up to date. However, I suspect that the quality of the Display Port cable may be contributory to the issue. If anyone has encountered a comparable circumstance or possesses insights into a potential remedy, I would be grateful for your assistance.	1.0	t3_190qkye	reddit

At my work we have these amazing widescreen monitors with built in USB-docking. Perfect for free seating etc. as you can use any monitor only connecting your laptop through the use of a USB-C cable (screen, power and data transfer). I recently sold my desktop computer at home, 'cause I figured I should take on this digital journey where all I have is two laptops, one for personal use and one for work, and one monitor to rule them all. This is where it gets tricky for me. So my work laptop obviously have the correct USB-ports as it's used in the intended way at work. For personal use I purchased an Acer Swift X SFX14-41G 14"". I figured the connectors/ports seemed about right, being: HDMI, USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 (supports DisplayPort Alt Mode) (DC-In-kombo, Power Delivery), USB 3.2 Gen 1, USB 3.2 Gen 1 (with power charging). Then off to the universe of USB connetors on monitors. I keep searching online but I just can't find the specifications that tell me ""purchase this monitor, this is what you need"". So what I want to be able to do is: connect one keyboard, one mouse and a set of speakers or headphones directly into a monitor througu USB. I want to connect a power supply into the monitor. Then, the only thing connecting my laptop to the monitor should be a USB-C cable, supplying the laptop with power and mouse/keyboard input, and vice versa sending the display to the monitor (plus data to the speakers I guess). I've found different monitors that I assume can adhere to my request, but I am not sure. Some monitors have a ""USB docking"" that require a USB type-A upstream supply from the monitor for the docking USB's to work, while some have thunderbolt, some have USB-C 3.2 (gen 1/gen 2), USB-C one-way transfer (?) etc. What I need to know is: **What monitor may I purchase? What are the key requirements/specifications I should look for in a monitor? Does the monitor need to support USB-C 3-2 (gen 2) as my laptop? Do you have any examples? FYI I like gaming so 100hz would probably be nice.** Sorry for long post."	2.0	t3_190d44n	reddit

I installed the new SSD. Since that time, I have no sound in Windows and when going to BIOS I see nothing about sound and my scren in BIOS is really dark. I downloaded new audio drivers, but installing them does nothing, as Windows does not even detect sound in device manager. It's like I have no sound anymore. Audio was working fine before I installed the new SSD and I didn't touchthe old working SSD. It's on a laptop so is it possible I messed with something when I opened the laptop to install the new SSD and if so what can be done to correct the problem? BTW I tried to install Linux on the new SSD and screen is really dark too on live USB. Thanks	2.0	t3_1905l9i	reddit

TLDR: I don’t have physical or monetary access to pro laptop repair. So I replaced the fans in my Rog zephyrus GX502L got it to boot with all parts functioning, suddenly it shut off and I cannot get it to boot now. For context, I am in a remote town and have no easy or cheap access to a pc repair shop, I would have gone if I could. Recently the fans stopped working on my (out of warranty, refurbished) Asus Rog zephyrus. They were loud and not spinning properly. I did everything I could before finally deciding to order some new parts and do it myself. I did my research and took all precautions about static and the like. I after a while the new parts arrived and I managed to get them installed after a few hiccups. This is when I managed to get the laptop to start normally, the new fans spun and I reached the desktop. However as I went to check I hadn’t knocked the cpu out or something it suddenly shut off. Being at the end of a long day I decided to leave it till the next evening. Unfortunately, now only the keyboard and the “on light” flash before it stops. That only occurs after I do the whole “unplug the battery, button for 60 seconds” thing. I am new to this and very lost, in my home town I just went to the pc shop but I don’t have that option. So any advice is appreciated, even if it is “give up”.	1.0	t3_18zlt9x	reddit

I'll soon start my computer engineering university program, and I'm torn between purchasing a **14"" MacBook Pro with M1 chip or a 15"" MacBook Air with M2 chip.** My needs will involve programming, web browsing, video streaming, and the creation of some 3D models for 3D printing. What leads me to prefer the **MacBook Pro with M3** is the superior display (120Hz vs 60Hz), longer battery life, more available ports, and undoubtedly better performance. On the other hand, the **MacBook Air** would be more convenient for its lower price, and I am concerned that the Pro model may not be truly necessary for my needs. I don't deny, though, that the idea of having a MacBook Pro is very appealing to me, and at the moment, I am inclined to choose that one cause i just discovered that their weight is almost the same.

I have an Intel Optane H10 32gb with 512gb QLC SSD and I was eyeing the Samsung 970 Evo Plus 2tb as my main new SSD drive. Although, **I dunno if it would be the right choice for my needs so I'm here to ask you some opinions on the matter**. I know that, thanks to 3D XPoint memory technology, Intel Optane should be faster in boot up, random file access and light work than any other SSD while being actually worse with heavier and more sustained workloads, due to the limited cache and the slow QLC SSD that it's paired with. I often use Lightoom/Photoshop/DaVinci/Illustrator for some projects and sometimes I also game a little bit. **Will 970 Evo Plus make a positive difference on those scenarios or not?** Will I also gonna feel my pc as less responsive during light work like browsing and office work, as well as experiencing a slower boot up time (currently I have 1.8 second BIOS boot up time shown on task manager)?

145	Laptop suddenly died when charging batteries from it	Unknown	2024-01-05 08:44:53	https://www.reddit.com/r/computer/comments/18z29yp/laptop_suddenly_died_when_charging_batteries_from/	Hi, I hope someone might be able to help. I have a HP Envy laptop. I was charging my drone batteries from it using the USB. On the battery charger hub there is a button which I stupidly pushed. I think the button reverses the charge so whatever is connected to the battery gets charged from the battery. The laptop instantly died. No pushing the power button on the laptop does nothing. It is now disconnected from the drone battery. Any ideas would be appreciated	2.0	t3_18z29yp	reddit

[https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/CdfTjH](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/CdfTjH) The use is for geospatial work no GPU required as I7 - 14700 K can run without GPU. I want to run this nearly 24 7 on all cores/threads with python code. I7 - 14700 K can run hot so trying to keep it cool. I've got code running on i7-6850K CPU so 6 core 12 threads and using around 32 GB of RAM of the 64 GB avaliable and likely to run for another 2 or 3 months. So I am hoping for this new build approach should be done in 2 weeks. AWS/GCP/Azure is sitting at around $3 K to finish the processing so cheaper to build my own PC and run it, then I'm left with a PC to use rather then spent cash.	2.0	t3_18z1pse	reddit

The problem seems to occur randomly, making it challenging to pinpoint the root cause. There are times when my PC works flawlessly, and then there are instances where I'm plagued by frequent blue screens, rendering my system unusable. Recently, the situation has worsened to the point where every time I start my PC, I'm greeted by a blue screen notifying me that the system didn't start correctly, prompting me to either restart or explore other options. In my quest to resolve these issues, I've done my fair share of research, delving into tutorials and scouring various websites for potential solutions. I've even reached out to the person who built the PC for me, but unfortunately, none of the suggestions or advice provided have made a significant impact or revealed the underlying cause. I'm reaching out to this community in the hopes that some experienced individuals might shed some light on this matter. Has anyone faced a similar situation, and if so, how did you go about resolving it? I'm open to any guidance, suggestions, or troubleshooting steps that could help me get to the bottom of this persistent blue screen problem. Thank you in advance for your assistance!	1.0	t3_18ytf0a	reddit

Nothing has worked. Its more so annoying at this point as I wanna get this issue solved before I head back to college.

I thought It was Thermal Throttling at first but after trying some repairs it didnt do the trick. I should also mention I cannot undervolt or underclock my CPU/GPU because of my motherboard and CPU. I'm desperate for a fix at this point and do not wanna replace the computer as all of these are fairly new parts.

So I replaced the memory in one of my laptops and wasn't really paying attention as I was setting everything up and apparently I deleted something I wasn't supposed to. So now when I try to start it up to load an operating system it shows that one of the partitions has been deleted, if I try to refresh it shows that the drive is locked. I got my other laptop up and running just fine so I'm curious if I can just pull that nvme out, put it in the housing and then plug it into my other laptop and just reinitialize it. I've tried a few different fixes I found online but most of them are referring to a situation where your computer still boots up properly and then shows an issue. Mine boots up and then shows a light blue screen, not the blue screen of death, the windows blue error screen and then you hit escape and you can go to the boot menu, bios settings, system tests, all of that fun stuff, but I can't get past that point.	1.0	t3_18yj54v	reddit

When I went into the user folder directory the data remained despite me deleting it, as the user doesn’t exist anymore. I attempted to delete it and it gave me an error saying *assortment of numbers* needed to give you permission. Anyway I tried using mcafee shred feature and it worked in removing MOST of it but some still remain, with the same error. I did something stupid, and went into the properties menu and noticed two selections listed, one of which was the same assortment of numbers + account unknown the error had and I removed it from the properties list. I got a windows security warning saying I should reverse the action but I didn’t even realize exactly what I did, so I haven’t reversed it. Still can’t remove the user folder, for whats left of it. Currently in the properties menu it has; my main account, SYSTEM, system administrator, and another account unknown and an assortment of numbers, similar to the one I had initially removed. What I’m asking is what can I do to remove this user folder, I wanted to remove it initially because I was afraid there could be malware on it. I never downloaded anything sketchy but I visited a few websites and I had not gone into this in several weeks, but prior my computer would take a year to shut off after pressing shutdown and I think it only does this when I logged into that user. And as far as that goes, would I be better off doing a factory reset given that I messed with properties and stuff? I’m a bit afraid to do one because my computer came with nvidia graphics drivers and stuff(not preloaded though!) and I don’t know how to get them back after a factory reset. and for anything potentially complex relating to computer files and stuff PLEASE explain it to me like I’m a baby cause I don’t understand computer stuff much.

I'm off to university next year, so it will be mainly used for writing essays and research, and the occasional movie. I want a touchscreen because that's what I'm used to. I like the layout of the hp models better, but the Lenovo screen is larger and better to look at, and I've been told it has a better, more durable build. But I've also heard some horror stories about the frames on Lenovo Computers snapping. Is it worth the risk, or should I stick with hp? I've caught them in a sale so they're all in my price range. However, I would save about $500 by getting the hp Pavilion. Would it be worth saving money, or investing more for one of the others? Does anyone know from experience which one would be better for me? The hp Zbook Firefly is also a business computer, unlike the others which are consumer models, and I was wondering whether you could tell me what the main difference between these is.

My laptop finally bit the dust this past week, and this morning more specifically. The laptop will not turn on with the power button. However, if I put the charger in (which was working last night), the blue light stays on (indicating that the laptop is fully charged, blinking I believe means charging). Even with the cord plugged into the wall and into the laptop, or removed from the wall but still in the laptop, or fully unplugged, the computer does not turn on. Interestingly, the week before, the WiFi adapter card wasn't working, more specifically the Killer Wifi 6AX1650i 160mhz wireless adapter card wouldn't stay on. Periodically, it would turn on indiscriminately. Sometimes if I did a network reset and windows update, or did a restart and wired connection, sometimes if I manually went into the KillerControlSense and turned on the wireless ""Xtend""er button. The culprit? I was using the laptop at high energy on a blanket (rarely do that), but didn't put it to sleep. I thought I shut it off, but I returned to my bedroom after eight hours to find it super hot, which I prompted me to elevate it, put on full fans on max turbo mode, and then keep using it for an hour, on WiFi, and charging. My only assumption is that after three years of heavy usage on a wooden surface (and recently last night on my blanket), that I may have melted or sparked something in the motherboard, or perhaps clogged it, or just didn't update the Bios and WiFi card (which I had thought I had did…) I am to take off the backboard and try to find a reset button, or reseating some components and getting a closer look.

211	My PC randomly turns off	Unknown	2024-01-02 14:58:49	https://www.reddit.com/r/computer/comments/18wrbwa/my_pc_randomly_turns_off/	"Hi. I have a problem with my PC and after using all the possibilities I know, it still randomly turns off. For example, I turn on my PC, I am working for a while and suddenly the monitor goes black, graphic card's fans goes maximum rpm and there is no reaction to the mouse and keyboard. After 1-2 minutes, PC restarts itself and fans goes normal speed but sometimes all I can do is hit the power button and restart in manually. Whenever this happens, the computer stops responding to the mouse and keyboard as if they were not connected. It happens 1-2 times a day and I don't know what is the cause. You can see events in Event Viewer. Dou you have any idea where is the problem? **What I have done so far:** \- Update BIOS to version 2001 \- Update all drivers from Asus website \- Update Nvidia drivers to 546.33 \- Reinstall Windows 11 Pro 22H2 (22621.2861) \- Check cables and devices connected to the PC **Specification:** \- Intel Core i5-11400 \- Asus ROG STRIX B560-I GAMING WIFI \- Kingston Fury Renegade 32 GB RAM DDR4 3600MHz (set 3200 Hz due to maximum supported memory speed) \- MSI Geforce RTX 2060 SUPER GAMING X 8GB GDDR6 \- NZXT H1 2022 (CA-H16WR-B1-EU) \- 650 W PSU \- WD Black SN750 500GB M.2 PCIe NVMe \- Kingston KC3000 2 TB \- 2x SSD SATA 2,5"" \- MX Master 3 and MX Keys connected via Bluetooth"	4.0	t3_18wrbwa	reddit

Games like Valorant, Counter-Strike, or Steam games like Lethal Company, Phasmophobia. I recently found out eGPUs are a thing and I was wondering if it is possible to have an eGPU for my laptop. Based on some videos and Reddit threads eGPUs connected to your laptop have a bit lower performance as the signal goes from the laptop to the eGPU and back. So I do have a random China made monitor my dad got for me but I don’t know what brand is it or what refresh rate is the monitor. But the main thing is can I have an eGPU to make gaming experience on my laptop better? Or is it better to just upgrade altogether?	2.0	t3_18wmhwp	reddit

Why are refrigerated CPU coolers not a thing? We use radiators and closed water cooling loops but I don’t see why the same technology used in refrigeration couldn’t be applied in a smaller scale. CPUs could be theoretically then be designed to operate at much lower temperatures and pull more power before overheating. I’m sure this has been done/tried and the drawbacks must be numerous if it isn’t already commonplace.	5.0	t3_18w8545	reddit

Got it all together and it started up fine initially but the stock cooler was dead. Replaced the cooler with a hyper 212, and now the computer won’t post with both RAM sticks. I initially thought I reseated the cpu incorrectly, but I did that but nothing. Tested the ram and found that with one stick in any of the slots will work. The only way to get it to post with one stick after trying with both is to clear the BIOS settings by removing the CMOS battery. Even then it will only work sometimes. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.

So now I’m thinking it’s either my PSU or RAM. Guys I’m really at the end of my rope here. I have no idea what is wrong.

253	A Survey of Current Trends in Distributed, Grid and Cloud Computing	Gaurav Mittal	2013-08-08 10:23:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1806v1	Through the 1990s to 2012 the internet changed the world of computing drastically. It started its journey with parallel computing after it advanced to distributed computing and further to grid computing. And in present scenario it creates a new world which is pronounced as a Cloud Computing [1]. These all three terms have different meanings. Cloud computing is based on backward computing schemes like cluster computing, distributed computing, grid computing and utility computing. The basic concept of cloud computing is virtualization. It provides virtual hardware and software resources to various requesting programs. This paper gives a detailed description about cluster computing, grid computing and cloud computing and gives an insight of some implementations of the same. We try to list the inspirations for the advent of all these technologies. We also account for some present scenario faults of grid computing and also discuss new cloud computing projects which are being managed by the Government of India for learning. The paper also reviews the existing work and covers (analytically), to some extent, some innovative ideas that can be implemented.			arxiv	['Dr. Nishtha Kesswani', 'Kuldeep Goswami']	4.0
254	Analysis on Computation-Intensive Status Update in Mobile Edge Computing	Qiaobin Kuang	2020-02-15 15:45:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06400v1	In status update scenarios, the freshness of information is measured in terms of age-of-information (AoI), which essentially reflects the timeliness for real-time applications to transmit status update messages to a remote controller. For some applications, computational expensive and time consuming data processing is inevitable for status information of messages to be displayed. Mobile edge servers are equipped with adequate computation resources and they are placed close to users. Thus, mobile edge computing (MEC) can be a promising technology to reduce AoI for computation-intensive messages. In this paper, we study the AoI for computation-intensive messages with MEC, and consider three computing schemes: local computing, remote computing at the MEC server, and partial computing, i.e., some part of computing tasks are performed locally, and the rest is executed at the MEC server. Zero-wait policy is adopted in all three schemes. Specifically, in local computing, a new message is generated immediately after the previous one is revealed by computing. While in remote computing and partial computing, a new message is generated once the previous one is received by the remote MEC server. With infinite queue size and exponentially distributed transmission time, closed-form average AoI for exponentially distributed computing time is derived for the three computing schemes. For deterministic computing time, the average AoI is analyzed numerically. Simulation results show that by carefully partitioning the computing tasks, the average AoI in partial computing is the smallest compared to local computing and remote computing. The results also indicate numerically the conditions on which remote computing attains smaller average AoI compared with local computing.			arxiv	['Jie Gong', 'Xiang Chen', 'Xiao Ma']	5.0
255	Computable structures on topological manifolds	Marcelo A. Aguilar	2017-03-12 06:14:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04075v2	We propose a definition of computable manifold by introducing computability as a structure that we impose to a given topological manifold, just in the same way as differentiability or piecewise linearity are defined for smooth and PL manifolds respectively. Using the framework of computable topology and Type-2 theory of effectivity, we develop computable versions of all the basic concepts needed to define manifolds, like computable atlases and (computably) compatible computable atlases. We prove that given a computable atlas $\Phi$ defined on a set $M$, we can construct a computable topological space $(M, \tau_\Phi, \beta_\Phi, \nu_\Phi)$, where $\tau_\Phi$ is the topology on $M$ induced by $\Phi$ and that the equivalence class of this computable space characterizes the computable structure determined by $\Phi$. The concept of computable submanifold is also investigated. We show that any compact computable manifold which satisfies a computable version of the $T_2$-separation axiom, can be embedded as a computable submanifold of some euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{q}$, with a computable embedding, where $\mathbb{R}^{q}$ is equipped with its usual topology and some canonical computable encoding of all open rational balls.			arxiv	['Rodolfo Conde']	6.0

However, there are dozens of different definitions for Cloud Computing and there seems to be no consensus on what a Cloud is. On the other hand, Cloud Computing is not a completely new concept; it has intricate connection to the relatively new but thirteen-year established Grid Computing paradigm, and other relevant technologies such as utility computing, cluster computing, and distributed systems in general. This paper strives to compare and contrast Cloud Computing with Grid Computing from various angles and give insights into the essential characteristics of both.			arxiv	['Yong Zhao', 'Ioan Raicu', 'Shiyong Lu']	7.0

258	Turing machines can be efficiently simulated by the General Purpose Analog Computer	Amaury Pouly	2012-03-21 07:48:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4667v2	The Church-Turing thesis states that any sufficiently powerful computational model which captures the notion of algorithm is computationally equivalent to the Turing machine. This equivalence usually holds both at a computability level and at a computational complexity level modulo polynomial reductions. However, the situation is less clear in what concerns models of computation using real numbers, and no analog of the Church-Turing thesis exists for this case. Recently it was shown that some models of computation with real numbers were equivalent from a computability perspective. In particular it was shown that Shannon's General Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC) is equivalent to Computable Analysis. However, little is known about what happens at a computational complexity level. In this paper we shed some light on the connections between this two models, from a computational complexity level, by showing that, modulo polynomial reductions, computations of Turing machines can be simulated by GPACs, without the need of using more (space) resources than those used in the original Turing computation, as long as we are talking about bounded computations. In other words, computations done by the GPAC are as space-efficient as computations done in the context of Computable Analysis.			arxiv	['Olivier Bournez', 'Daniel S. Graça']	9.0
259	Typologies of Computation and Computational Models	Mark Burgin	2013-12-09 14:35:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2447v1	We need much better understanding of information processing and computation as its primary form. Future progress of new computational devices capable of dealing with problems of big data, internet of things, semantic web, cognitive robotics and neuroinformatics depends on the adequate models of computation. In this article we first present the current state of the art through systematization of existing models and mechanisms, and outline basic structural framework of computation. We argue that defining computation as information processing, and given that there is no information without (physical) representation, the dynamics of information on the fundamental level is physical/ intrinsic/ natural computation. As a special case, intrinsic computation is used for designed computation in computing machinery. Intrinsic natural computation occurs on variety of levels of physical processes, containing the levels of computation of living organisms (including highly intelligent animals) as well as designed computational devices. The present article offers a typology of current models of computation and indicates future paths for the advancement of the field; both by the development of new computational models and by learning from nature how to better compute using different mechanisms of intrinsic computation.			arxiv	['Gordana Dodig-Crnkovic']	10.0
260	Computing Power Network: A Survey	Yukun Sun	2022-10-12 10:52:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06080v2	With the rapid development of cloud computing, edge computing, and smart devices, computing power resources indicate a trend of ubiquitous deployment. The traditional network architecture cannot efficiently leverage these distributed computing power resources due to computing power island effect. To overcome these problems and improve network efficiency, a new network computing paradigm is proposed, i.e., Computing Power Network (CPN). Computing power network can connect ubiquitous and heterogenous computing power resources through networking to realize computing power scheduling flexibly. In this survey, we make an exhaustive review on the state-of-the-art research efforts on computing power network. We first give an overview of computing power network, including definition, architecture, and advantages. Next, a comprehensive elaboration of issues on computing power modeling, information awareness and announcement, resource allocation, network forwarding, computing power transaction platform and resource orchestration platform is presented. The computing power network testbed is built and evaluated. The applications and use cases in computing power network are discussed. Then, the key enabling technologies for computing power network are introduced. Finally, open challenges and future research directions are presented as well.			arxiv	['Bo Lei', 'Junlin Liu', 'Haonan Huang', 'Xing Zhang', 'Jing Peng', 'Wenbo Wang']	11.0
261	Duality and Recycling Computing in Quantum Computers	Gui Lu Long	2007-08-15 03:17:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1986v1	Quantum computer possesses quantum parallelism and offers great computing power over classical computer \cite{er1,er2}. As is well-know, a moving quantum object passing through a double-slit exhibits particle wave duality. A quantum computer is static and lacks this duality property. The recently proposed duality computer has exploited this particle wave duality property, and it may offer additional computing power \cite{r1}. Simply put it, a duality computer is a moving quantum computer passing through a double-slit. A duality computer offers the capability to perform separate operations on the sub-waves coming out of the different slits, in the so-called duality parallelism. Here we show that an $n$-dubit duality computer can be modeled by an $(n+1)$-qubit quantum computer. In a duality mode, computing operations are not necessarily unitary. A $n$-qubit quantum computer can be used as an $n$-bit reversible classical computer and is energy efficient. Our result further enables a $(n+1)$-qubit quantum computer to run classical algorithms in a $O(2^n)$-bit classical computer. The duality mode provides a natural link between classical computing and quantum computing. Here we also propose a recycling computing mode in which a quantum computer will continue to compute until the result is obtained. These two modes provide new tool for algorithm design. A search algorithm for the unsorted database search problem is designed.			arxiv	['Yang Liu']	12.0

267	Marvel DC: A Blockchain-Based Decentralized and Incentive-Compatible Distributed Computing Protocol	Conor McMenamin	2022-07-28 11:11:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14011v1	Decentralized computation outsourcing should allow anyone to access the large amounts of computational power that exists in the Internet of Things. Unfortunately, when trusted third parties are removed to achieve this decentralization, ensuring an outsourced computation is performed correctly remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we provide a solution to this problem. We outline Marvel DC, a fully decentralized blockchain-based distributed-computing protocol which formally guarantees that computers are strictly incentivized to correctly perform requested computations. Furthermore, Marvel DC utilizes a reputation management protocol to ensure that, for any minority of computers not performing calculations correctly, these computers are identified and selected for computations with diminishing probability. We then outline Privacy Marvel DC, a privacy-enhanced version of Marvel DC which decouples results from the computers which computed them, making the protocol suitable for computations such as Federated Learning, where results can reveal sensitive information about that computer that computed them. We provide an implementation of Marvel DC and analyses of both protocols, demonstrating that they are not only the first protocols to provide the aforementioned formal guarantees, but are also practical, competitive with prior attempts in the field, and ready to deploy.			arxiv	['Vanesa Daza']	18.0
268	Computing Offloading and Semantic Compression for Intelligent Computing Tasks in MEC Systems	Yuanpeng Zheng	2023-07-06 03:15:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02747v1	This paper investigates the intelligent computing task-oriented computing offloading and semantic compression in mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. With the popularity of intelligent applications in various industries, terminals increasingly need to offload intelligent computing tasks with complex demands to MEC servers for computing, which is a great challenge for bandwidth and computing capacity allocation in MEC systems. Considering the accuracy requirement of intelligent computing tasks, we formulate an optimization problem of computing offloading and semantic compression. We jointly optimize the system utility which are represented as computing accuracy and task delay respectively to acquire the optimized system utility. To solve the proposed optimization problem, we decompose it into computing capacity allocation subproblem and compression offloading subproblem and obtain solutions through convex optimization and successive convex approximation. After that, the offloading decisions, computing capacity and compressed ratio are obtained in closed forms. We design the computing offloading and semantic compression algorithm for intelligent computing tasks in MEC systems then. Simulation results represent that our algorithm converges quickly and acquires better performance and resource utilization efficiency through the trend with total number of users and computing capacity compared with benchmarks.			arxiv	['Tiankui Zhang', 'Rong Huang', 'Yapeng Wang']	19.0

Machta	1998-05-07 20:50:15	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9805022v1	Computational devices may be supplied with external sources of information (oracles). Quantum oracles may transmit phase information which is available to a quantum computer but not a classical computer. One consequence of this observation is that there is an oracle which is of no assistance to a classical computer but which allows a quantum computer to solve undecidable problems. Thus useful relativized separations between quantum and classical complexity classes must exclude the transmission of phase information from oracle to computer.			arxiv	[]	21.0

As a monad of this pair of adjoint operations we obtain a problem that characterizes the low functions and dually to this another problem that characterizes the functions that are computable relative to the halting problem. Correspondingly, these two classes are the largest classes of functions that can be pre or post composed to limit computable functions without leaving the class of limit computable functions. We transfer these observations to the lattice of represented spaces where it leads to a formal Galois connection. We also formulate a version of this result for computable metric spaces. Limit computability and computability relative to the halting problem are notions that coincide for points and sequences, but even restricted to continuous functions the former class is strictly larger than the latter. On computable metric spaces we can characterize the functions that are computable relative to the halting problem as those functions that are limit computable with a modulus of continuity that is computable relative to the halting problem. As a consequence of this result we obtain, for instance, that Lipschitz continuous functions that are limit computable are automatically computable relative to the halting problem. We also discuss 1-generic points as the canonical points of continuity of limit computable functions, and we prove that restricted to these points limit computable functions are computable relative to the halting problem. Finally, we demonstrate how these results can be applied in computable analysis.			arxiv	[]	38.0

There is a great deal of hype in this technology based area for that reason it is getting a great deal of attention of the computing community. Grid Computing makes use of clusters of PCs (personal computers), network servers or other computing technology-based systems. These systems are connecting jointly to deal with complex calculations, communication and collaboration. Grid Computing offers a great deal of support for offering corporations to make use of their idle computing power, or systems processing cycles, to produce a type of supercomputer arrangement. The technology of grid computing has newly transferred from customary high performance plus distributed technology based computing systems to utility and pervasive based computing arrangements. These technology-based structures are having superior potentials of the wireless networks communication and collaboration as well as having thin, lightweight and remotely accessible devices. This has as produced the establishment new computing technology paradigm known as Mobile Grid Computing. This research is going to assess and analyze the grid computing and mobile computing technology based arrangements. Here I will assess the feasibility analysis of the mobile grid computing. This research will analyze the mapping of grid computing techniques on the mobile domain. In this scenario, I will assess how can, we achieve grid architecture in mobile devices. For the sake of implementing a mobile gird arrangement, I will analyze the existing grid computing models and discuss the design, implementation, architecture and its limitations. This research will also highlight the effect of grid computing on mobiles load balancing, high processing efficiency and less network communication.			arxiv	[]	40.0

To overcome the limitations that restrict such applications, the development of a comprehensive computing paradigm has garnered attention in both academia and industry. However, a gap exists in the literature owing to the scarce research, and a comprehensive computing paradigm is yet to be systematically designed and reviewed. This study introduces a novel concept, called aerial computing, via the amalgamation of aerial radio access networks and edge computing, which attempts to bridge the gap. Specifically, first, we propose a novel comprehensive computing architecture that is composed of low-altitude computing, high-altitude computing, and satellite computing platforms, along with conventional computing systems. We determine that aerial computing offers several desirable attributes: global computing service, better mobility, higher scalability and availability, and simultaneity. Second, we comprehensively discuss key technologies that facilitate aerial computing, including energy refilling, edge computing, network softwarization, frequency spectrum, multi-access techniques, artificial intelligence, and big data. In addition, we discuss vertical domain applications (e.g., smart cities, smart vehicles, smart factories, and smart grids) supported by aerial computing. Finally, we highlight several challenges that need to be addressed and their possible solutions.			arxiv	['Rukhsana Ruby', 'Fang Fang', 'Dinh C.

292	Nearly Computable Real Numbers	Peter Hertling	2023-01-19 15:37:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08124v2	"In this article we call a sequence $(a_n)_n$ of elements of a metric space nearly computably Cauchy if for every strictly increasing computable function $r:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ the sequence $(d(a_{r(n+1)},a_{r(n)}))_n$ converges computably to $0$. We show that there exists a strictly increasing sequence of rational numbers that is nearly computably Cauchy and unbounded. Then we call a real number $\alpha$ nearly computable if there exists a computable sequence $(a_n)_n$ of rational numbers that converges to $\alpha$ and is nearly computably Cauchy. It is clear that every computable real number is nearly computable, and it follows from a result by Downey and LaForte (2002) that there exists a nearly computable and left-computable number that is not computable. We observe that the set of nearly computable real numbers is a real closed field and closed under computable real functions with open domain, but not closed under arbitrary computable real functions. Among other things we strengthen results by Hoyrup (2017) and by Stephan and Wu (2005) by showing that any nearly computable real number that is not computable is weakly $1$-generic (and, therefore, hyperimmune and not Martin-L\""of random) and strongly Kurtz random (and, therefore, not $K$-trivial), and we strengthen a result by Downey and LaForte (2002) by showing that no promptly simple set can be Turing reducible to a nearly computable real number."			arxiv	['Philip Janicki']	43.0
293	Quantum Computing Using Crossed Atomic Beams	P. Blythe	2006-05-22 10:54:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605190v2	A quantum computer is a hypothetical device in which the laws of quantum mechanics are used to introduce a degree of parallelism into computations and which could therefore significantly improve on the computational speed of a classical computer at certain tasks. Cluster state quantum computing (recently proposed by Raussendorf and Briegel) is a new paradigm in quantum information processing and is a departure from the conventional model of quantum computation. The cluster state quantum computer begins by creating a highly entangled multi-particle state (the cluster state) which it uses as a quantum resource during the computation. Information is processed in the computer via selected measurements on individual qubits that form the cluster state. We describe in detail how a scalable quantum computer can be constructed using microwave cavity QED and, in a departure from the traditional understanding of a computer as a fixed array of computational elements, we show that cluster state quantum computing is well suited to atomic beam experiments. We show that all of the necessary elements have been individually realised, and that the construction of a truly scalable atomic beam quantum computer may be an experimental reality in the near future.			arxiv	['B.

294	Autonomic Cloud Computing: Research Perspective	Sukhpal Singh Gill	2015-07-06 17:27:04	http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01546v2	Cloud computing is an evolving utility computing mechanism in which cloud consumer can detect, choose and utilize the resources (infrastructure, software and platform) and provide service to user based on pay per use model as computing utilities. Current computing mechanism is effective, particular for medium and small cloud based companies, in which it permits easy and reliable access to cloud services like infrastructure, software and platform. Present cloud computing is almost similar to the existing models: cluster computing and grid computing. The important key technical features of cloud computing which includes autonomic service, rapid elasticity, end-to-end virtualization support, on-demand resource pooling and transparency in cloud billing. Further, non-technical features of cloud computing includes environment friendliness, little maintenance overhead, lower upfront costs, faster time to deployments, Service Level Agreement (SLA) and pay-as-you-go-model. In distributed computing environment, unpredictability of service is a fact, so same possible in cloud also. The success of next-generation Cloud Computing infrastructures will depend on how capably these infrastructures will discover and dynamically tolerate computing platforms, which meet randomly varying resource and service requirements of Cloud costumer applications.			arxiv	[]	45.0

These observations capture various situations pertinent to people's needs and interests along with all their idiosyncrasies. To support human-centered computing that empower people in making better and timely decisions, we look towards computation that is inspired by human perception and cognition. Toward this goal, we discuss computing paradigms of semantic computing, cognitive computing, and an emerging aspect of computing, which we call perceptual computing. In our view, these offer a continuum to make the most out of vast, growing, and diverse data pertinent to human needs and interests. We propose details of perceptual computing characterized by interpretation and exploration operations comparable to the interleaving of bottom and top brain processing. This article consists of two parts. First we describe semantic computing, cognitive computing, and perceptual computing to lay out distinctions while acknowledging their complementary capabilities. We then provide a conceptual overview of the newest of these three paradigms--perceptual computing. For further insights, we focus on an application scenario of asthma management converting massive, heterogeneous and multimodal (big) data into actionable information or smart data.			arxiv	['Pramod Anantharam', 'Cory Henson']	46.0
296	How Far Can We Go in Compute-less Networking: Computation Correctness and Accuracy	Boubakr Nour	2021-03-29 19:57:16	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15924v2	Emerging applications such as augmented reality and tactile Internet are compute-intensive and latency-sensitive, which hampers their running in constrained end devices alone or in the distant cloud. The stringent requirements of such application drove to the realization of Edge computing in which computation is offloaded near to users. Compute-less networking is an extension of edge computing that aims at reducing computation and abridging communication by adopting in-network computing and computation reuse. Computation reuse aims to cache the result of computations and use them to perform similar tasks in the future and, therefore, avoid redundant calculations and optimize the use of resources. In this paper, we focus on the correctness of the final output produced by computation reuse. Since the input might not be identical but similar, the reuse of previous computation raises questions about the accuracy of the final results. To this end, we implement a proof of concept to study and gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of computation reuse. We are able to reduce task completion time by up to 80% while ensuring high correctness. We further discuss open challenges and highlight future research directions.			arxiv	['Soumaya Cherkaoui']	47.0
297	The Case for the Anonymization of Offloaded Computation	Md Washik Al Azad	2023-05-12 23:49:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07803v1	Computation offloading (often to external computing resources over a network) has become a necessity for modern applications. At the same time, the proliferation of machine learning techniques has empowered malicious actors to use such techniques in order to breach the privacy of the execution process for offloaded computations. This can enable malicious actors to identify offloaded computations and infer their nature based on computation characteristics that they may have access to even if they do not have direct access to the computation code. In this paper, we first demonstrate that even non-sophisticated machine learning algorithms can accurately identify offloaded computations. We then explore the design space of anonymizing offloaded computations through the realization of a framework, called Camouflage. Camouflage features practical mechanisms to conceal characteristics related to the execution of computations, which can be used by malicious actors to identify computations and orchestrate further attacks based on identified computations. Our evaluation demonstrated that Camouflage can impede the ability of malicious actors to identify executed computations by up to 60%, while incurring modest overheads for the anonymization of computations.			arxiv	['Shifat Sarwar', 'Sifat Ut Taki', 'Spyridon Mastorakis']	48.0
298	The Marriage of Incremental and Approximate Computing	Dhanya R Krishnan	2016-11-25 20:05:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08573v1	Most data analytics systems that require low-latency execution and efficient utilization of computing resources, increasingly adopt two computational paradigms, namely, incremental and approximate computing. Incremental computation updates the output incrementally instead of re-computing everything from scratch for successive runs of a job with input changes. Approximate computation returns an approximate output for a job instead of the exact output. Both paradigms rely on computing over a subset of data items instead of computing over the entire dataset, but they differ in their means for skipping parts of the computation. Incremental computing relies on the memoization of intermediate results of sub-computations, and reusing these memoized results across jobs for sub-computations that are unaffected by the changed input. Approximate computing relies on representative sampling of the entire dataset to compute over a subset of data items. In this thesis, we make the observation that these two computing paradigms are complementary, and can be married together! The high level idea is to: design a sampling algorithm that biases the sample selection to the memoized data items from previous runs. To concretize this idea, we designed an online stratified sampling algorithm that uses self-adjusting computation to produce an incrementally updated approximate output with bounded error. We implemented our algorithm in a data analytics system called IncAppox based on Apache Spark Streaming. Our evaluation of the system shows that IncApprox achieves the benefits of both incremental and approximate computing.			arxiv	[]	49.0
299	Lifelong Computing	Danny Weyns	2021-08-19 17:19:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08802v1	"Computing systems form the backbone of many aspects of our life, hence they are becoming as vital as water, electricity, and road infrastructures for our society. Yet, engineering long running computing systems that achieve their goals in ever-changing environments pose significant challenges. Currently, we can build computing systems that adjust or learn over time to match changes that were anticipated. However, dealing with unanticipated changes, such as anomalies, novelties, new goals or constraints, requires system evolution, which remains in essence a human-driven activity. Given the growing complexity of computing systems and the vast amount of highly complex data to process, this approach will eventually become unmanageable. To break through the status quo, we put forward a new paradigm for the design and operation of computing systems that we coin ""lifelong computing."" The paradigm starts from computing-learning systems that integrate computing/service modules and learning modules. Computing warehouses offer such computing elements together with data sheets and usage guides. When detecting anomalies, novelties, new goals or constraints, a lifelong computing system activates an evolutionary self-learning engine that runs online experiments to determine how the computing-learning system needs to evolve to deal with the changes, thereby changing its architecture and integrating new computing elements from computing warehouses as needed. Depending on the domain at hand, some activities of lifelong computing systems can be supported by humans. We motivate the need for lifelong computing with a future fish farming scenario, outline a blueprint architecture for lifelong computing systems, and highlight key research challenges to realise the vision of lifelong computing."			arxiv	['Thomas Bäck', 'Renè Vidal', 'Xin Yao', 'Ahmed Nabil Belbachir']	50.0
300	Age-of-Information for Computation-Intensive Messages in Mobile Edge Computing	Qiaobin Kuang	2019-01-07 14:57:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01854v3	Age-of-information (AoI) is a novel metric that measures the freshness of information in status update scenarios. It is essential for real-time applications to transmit status update packets to the destination node as timely as possible. However, for some applications, status information embedded in the packets is not revealed until complicated data processing, which is computational expensive and time consuming. As mobile edge server has sufficient computational resource and is placed close to users, mobile edge computing (MEC) is expected to reduce age for computation-intensive messages. In this paper, we study the AoI for computation-intensive data in MEC, and consider two schemes: local computing by user itself and remote computing at MEC server. The two computing models are unified into a two-node tandem queuing model. Zero-wait policy is adopted, i.e., a new message is generated once the previous one leaves the first node. We consider exponentially distributed service time and infinite queue size, and hence, the second node can be seen as a First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) M/M/1 system. Closed-form average AoI is derived for the two computing schemes. The region where remote computing outperforms local computing is characterized. Simulation results show that the remote computing is greatly superior to the local computing when the remote computing rate is large enough, and that there exists an optimal transmission rate so that remote computing is better than local computing for a largest range.			arxiv	['Jie Gong', 'Xiang Chen', 'Xiao Ma']	51.0
301	Neuromorphic Computing is Turing-Complete	Prasanna Date	2021-04-28 19:25:01	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13983v1	Neuromorphic computing is a non-von Neumann computing paradigm that performs computation by emulating the human brain. Neuromorphic systems are extremely energy-efficient and known to consume thousands of times less power than CPUs and GPUs. They have the potential to drive critical use cases such as autonomous vehicles, edge computing and internet of things in the future. For this reason, they are sought to be an indispensable part of the future computing landscape. Neuromorphic systems are mainly used for spike-based machine learning applications, although there are some non-machine learning applications in graph theory, differential equations, and spike-based simulations. These applications suggest that neuromorphic computing might be capable of general-purpose computing. However, general-purpose computability of neuromorphic computing has not been established yet. In this work, we prove that neuromorphic computing is Turing-complete and therefore capable of general-purpose computing. Specifically, we present a model of neuromorphic computing, with just two neuron parameters (threshold and leak), and two synaptic parameters (weight and delay). We devise neuromorphic circuits for computing all the {\mu}-recursive functions (i.e., constant, successor and projection functions) and all the {\mu}-recursive operators (i.e., composition, primitive recursion and minimization operators). Given that the {\mu}-recursive functions and operators are precisely the ones that can be computed using a Turing machine, this work establishes the Turing-completeness of neuromorphic computing.			arxiv	['Catherine Schuman', 'Bill Kay', 'Thomas Potok']	52.0

In recent years, we have witnessed the emergence of intelligent computing, a new computing paradigm that is reshaping traditional computing and promoting digital revolution in the era of big data, artificial intelligence and internet-of-things with new computing theories, architectures, methods, systems, and applications. Intelligent computing has greatly broadened the scope of computing, extending it from traditional computing on data to increasingly diverse computing paradigms such as perceptual intelligence, cognitive intelligence, autonomous intelligence, and human-computer fusion intelligence. Intelligence and computing have undergone paths of different evolution and development for a long time but have become increasingly intertwined in recent years: intelligent computing is not only intelligence-oriented but also intelligence-driven. Such cross-fertilization has prompted the emergence and rapid advancement of intelligent computing. Intelligent computing is still in its infancy and an abundance of innovations in the theories, systems, and applications of intelligent computing are expected to occur soon. We present the first comprehensive survey of literature on intelligent computing, covering its theory fundamentals, the technological fusion of intelligence and computing, important applications, challenges, and future perspectives. We believe that this survey is highly timely and will provide a comprehensive reference and cast valuable insights into intelligent computing for academic and industrial researchers and practitioners.			arxiv	['Ting Yu', 'Tao Xu', 'Hongyang Chen', 'Schahram Dustdar', 'Sylvain Gigan', 'Deniz Gunduz', 'Ekram Hossain', 'Yaochu Jin', 'Feng Lin', 'Bo Liu', 'Zhiguo Wan', 'Ji Zhang', 'Zhifeng Zhao', 'Wentao Zhu', 'Zuoning Chen', 'Tariq Durrani', 'Huaimin Wang', 'Jiangxing Wu', 'Tongyi Zhang', 'Yunhe Pan']	53.0
303	Energy-Consumption Advantage of Quantum Computation	Florian Meier	2023-05-18 18:00:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11212v2	Energy consumption in solving computational problems has been gaining growing attention as a part of the performance measures of computers. Quantum computation is known to offer advantages over classical computation in terms of various computational resources; however, its advantage in energy consumption has been challenging to analyze due to the lack of a theoretical foundation to relate the physical notion of energy and the computer-scientific notion of complexity for quantum computation with finite computational resources. To bridge this gap, we introduce a general framework for studying the energy consumption of quantum and classical computation based on a computational model that has been conventionally used for studying query complexity in computational complexity theory. With this framework, we derive an upper bound for the achievable energy consumption of quantum computation. We also develop techniques for proving a nonzero lower bound of energy consumption of classical computation based on the energy-conservation law and Landauer's principle. With these general bounds, we rigorously prove that quantum computation achieves an exponential energy-consumption advantage over classical computation for solving a specific computational problem, Simon's problem. Furthermore, we clarify how to demonstrate this energy-consumption advantage of quantum computation in an experimental setting. These results provide a fundamental framework and techniques to explore the physical meaning of quantum advantage in the query-complexity setting based on energy consumption, opening an alternative way to study the advantages of quantum computation.			arxiv	['Hayata Yamasaki']	54.0

Examples of such models are cellular automata, spatial computation and space-time crystallography. For any computational model it is natural to define a functional equivalence of different but related computational structures. In the finite automata theory an example of such equivalence is automata homomorphism and, in particular, automata isomorphism. If we continue to stick to the finite automata theory, a fundamental question arise, what a state of a distributed computational structure is. This work is devoted to particular solution of the issue.			arxiv	[]	60.0

However, due to limitations in scalability of quantum technologies, it seems that we are far from constructing universal quantum computers for everyday users.

Due to these restrictions, only a small subset of less complicated and fast computable algorithms can be used for tactical, adaptive computing.			arxiv	['Venkat R.

In this work, we explore a new computation scheme, in which the linear operators in quantum computing are replaced by (higher) functors between two (higher) categories. If from Turing computing to quantum computing is the first quantization of computation, then this new scheme can be viewed as the second quantization of computation. The fundamental problem in realizing this idea is how to realize a (higher) functor physically. We provide a theoretical idea of realizing (higher) functors physically based on the physics of topological orders.			arxiv	['Hao Zheng']	70.0

This paper combines ideas of approximate computing with coded computing to further accelerate computation. We propose successive approximation coding (SAC) techniques that realize a tradeoff between accuracy and speed, allowing the distributed computing system to produce approximations that increase in accuracy over time. If a sufficient number of compute nodes finish their tasks, SAC exactly recovers the desired computation. We theoretically provide design guidelines for our SAC techniques, and numerically show that SAC achieves a better accuracy-speed tradeoff in comparison with previous methods.			arxiv	['Stark C.

Many uses of quantum computers will be hybrid, with classical computers still playing an important role in operating and using the quantum computer. The term hybrid is however diffuse and multi-interpretable. In this work we define two classes of hybrid quantum-classical computing: vertical and horizontal. The first is application-agnostic and concerns using quantum computers. The second is application-specific and concerns running an algorithm. For both, we give a further subdivision in different types of hybrid quantum-classical computing and we coin terms for them.			arxiv	['Niels Neumann', 'Robert Wezeman']	75.0

327	The unity between quantum field computation, real computation, and quantum computation	A. C. Manoharan	2001-09-04 03:01:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0109015v1	"It is indicated that principal models of computation are indeed significantly related. The quantum field computation model contains the quantum computation model of Feynman. (The term ""quantum field computer"" was used by Freedman.) Quantum field computation (as enhanced by Wightman's model of quantum field theory) involves computation over the continuum which is remarkably related to the real computation model of Smale. The latter model was established as a generalization of Turing computation. All this is not surprising since it is well known that the physics of quantum field theory (which includes Einstein's special relativity) contains quantum mechanics which in turn contains classical mechanics. The unity of these computing models, which seem to have grown largely independently, could shed new light into questions of computational complexity, into the central P (Polynomial time) versus NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial time) problem of computer science, and also into the description of Nature by fundamental physics theories."			arxiv	[]	78.0

Initially CDF computing was comprised of dedicated resources located in computer farms around the world. With the wide spread acceptance of grid computing in High Energy Physics, CDF computing has migrated to using grid computing extensively. CDF uses computing grids around the world. Each computing grid has required different solutions. The use of portals as interfaces to the collaboration computing resources has proven to be an extremely useful technique allowing the CDF physicists transparently migrate from using dedicated computer farm to using computing located in grid farms often away from Fermilab. Grid computing at CDF continues to evolve as the grid standards and practices change.			arxiv	[]	79.0
329	Point-Separable Classes of Simple Computable Planar Curves	Xizhong Zheng	2012-08-08 21:34:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2245v2	In mathematics curves are typically defined as the images of continuous real functions (parametrizations) defined on a closed interval. They can also be defined as connected one-dimensional compact subsets of points. For simple curves of finite lengths, parametrizations can be further required to be injective or even length-normalized. All of these four approaches to curves are classically equivalent. In this paper we investigate four different versions of computable curves based on these four approaches. It turns out that they are all different, and hence, we get four different classes of computable curves. More interestingly, these four classes are even point-separable in the sense that the sets of points covered by computable curves of different versions are also different. However, if we consider only computable curves of computable lengths, then all four versions of computable curves become equivalent. This shows that the definition of computable curves is robust, at least for those of computable lengths. In addition, we show that the class of computable curves of computable lengths is point-separable from the other four classes of computable curves.			arxiv	['Robert Rettinger']	80.0
330	Computing in matrix groups without memory	Peter J. Cameron	2013-10-22 18:47:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6009v1	Memoryless computation is a novel means of computing any function of a set of registers by updating one register at a time while using no memory. We aim to emulate how computations are performed on modern cores, since they typically involve updates of single registers. The computation model of memoryless computation can be fully expressed in terms of transformation semigroups, or in the case of bijective functions, permutation groups. In this paper, we view registers as elements of a finite field and we compute linear permutations without memory. We first determine the maximum complexity of a linear function when only linear instructions are allowed. We also determine which linear functions are hardest to compute when the field in question is the binary field and the number of registers is even. Secondly, we investigate some matrix groups, thus showing that the special linear group is internally computable but not fast. Thirdly, we determine the smallest set of instructions required to generate the special and general linear groups. These results are important for memoryless computation, for they show that linear functions can be computed very fast or that very few instructions are needed to compute any linear function. They thus indicate new advantages of using memoryless computation.			arxiv	['Ben Fairbairn', 'Maximilien Gadouleau']	81.0

Grid can be viewed as a distributed large-scale cluster computing. From other perspective, it constitutes the major part of Cloud Computing Systems in addition to thin clients and utility computing [1,2, 3]. Hence, Grid computing has attracted many researchers [4].

Building a quantum computer that can be used practically is in itself an outstanding challenge that has become the 'new race to the moon'. Next to researchers and vendors of future computing technologies, national authorities are showing strong interest in maturing this technology due to its known potential to break many of today's encryption techniques, which would have significant impact on our society. It is however quite likely that quantum computing has beneficial impact on many computational disciplines. In this article we describe our vision of future developments in scientific computing that would be enabled by the advent of software-programmable quantum computers. We thereby assume that quantum computers will form part of a hybrid accelerated computing platform like GPUs and co-processor cards do today. In particular, we address the potential of quantum algorithms to bring major breakthroughs in applied mathematics and its applications. Finally, we give several examples that demonstrate the possible impact of quantum-accelerated scientific computing on society.			arxiv	['Cornelis Vuik']	83.0

The need for more performant, comfortable and safe computing forced to develop and utilize several tricks both in hardware and software. Till now technology enabled to increase performance without changing the basic computing paradigms. The recent stalling of single-threaded computing performance, however, requires to redesign computing to be able to provide the expected performance. To do so, the computing paradigms themselves must be scrutinized. The limitations caused by the too restrictive interpretation of the computing paradigms are demonstrated, an extended computing paradigm introduced, ideas about changing elements of the computing stack suggested, some implementation details of both hardware and software discussed. The resulting new computing stack offers considerably higher computing throughput, simplified hardware architecture, drastically improved real-time behavior and in general, simplified and more efficient computing stack.			arxiv	[]	84.0
334	Computation Efficiency Maximization in Wireless-Powered Mobile Edge Computing Networks	Fuhui Zhou	2020-01-28 09:50:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10234v2	Energy-efficient computation is an inevitable trend for mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. Resource allocation strategies for maximizing the computation efficiency are critically important. In this paper, computation efficiency maximization problems are formulated in wireless-powered MEC networks under both partial and binary computation offloading modes. A practical non-linear energy harvesting model is considered. Both time division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are considered and evaluated for offloading. The energy harvesting time, the local computing frequency, and the offloading time and power are jointly optimized to maximize the computation efficiency under the max-min fairness criterion. Two iterative algorithms and two alternative optimization algorithms are respectively proposed to address the non-convex problems formulated in this paper. Simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation schemes outperform the benchmark schemes in terms of user fairness. Moreover, a tradeoff is elucidated between the achievable computation efficiency and the total number of computed bits. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate that the partial computation offloading mode outperforms the binary computation offloading mode and NOMA outperforms TDMA in terms of computation efficiency.			arxiv	['Rose Qingyang Hu']	85.0
335	Proof-of-work certificates that can be efficiently computed in the cloud	Jean-Guillaume Dumas	2018-06-29 08:13:29	http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11293v2	In an emerging computing paradigm, computational capabilities, from processing power to storage capacities, are offered to users over communication networks as a cloud-based service. There, demanding computations are outsourced in order to limit infrastructure costs. The idea of verifiable computing is to associate a data structure, a proof-of-work certificate, to the result of the outsourced computation. This allows a verification algorithm to prove the validity of the result, faster than by recomputing it. We talk about a Prover (the server performing the computations) and a Verifier. Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum gave in 2008 a generic method to verify any parallelizable computation, in almost linear time in the size of the, potentially structured, inputs and the result. However, the extra cost of the computations for the Prover (and therefore the extra cost to the customer), although only almost a constant factor of the overall work, is nonetheless prohibitive in practice. Differently, we will here present problem-specific procedures in computer algebra, e.g. for exact linear algebra computations, that are Prover-optimal, that is that have much less financial overhead.			arxiv	[]	86.0
336	Controlling Computation versus Quality for Neural Sequence Models	Ankur Bapna	2020-02-17 17:54:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07106v2	Most neural networks utilize the same amount of compute for every example independent of the inherent complexity of the input. Further, methods that adapt the amount of computation to the example focus on finding a fixed inference-time computational graph per example, ignoring any external computational budgets or varying inference time limitations. In this work, we utilize conditional computation to make neural sequence models (Transformer) more efficient and computation-aware during inference. We first modify the Transformer architecture, making each set of operations conditionally executable depending on the output of a learned control network. We then train this model in a multi-task setting, where each task corresponds to a particular computation budget. This allows us to train a single model that can be controlled to operate on different points of the computation-quality trade-off curve, depending on the available computation budget at inference time. We evaluate our approach on two tasks: (i) WMT English-French Translation and (ii) Unsupervised representation learning (BERT). Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed Conditional Computation Transformer (CCT) is competitive with vanilla Transformers when allowed to utilize its full computational budget, while improving significantly over computationally equivalent baselines when operating on smaller computational budgets.			arxiv	['Naveen Arivazhagan', 'Orhan Firat']	87.0
337	Slack Squeeze Coded Computing for Adaptive Straggler Mitigation	Krishna Giri Narra	2019-04-15 14:56:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07098v2	While performing distributed computations in today's cloud-based platforms, execution speed variations among compute nodes can significantly reduce the performance and create bottlenecks like stragglers. Coded computation techniques leverage coding theory to inject computational redundancy and mitigate stragglers in distributed computations. In this paper, we propose a dynamic workload distribution strategy for coded computation called Slack Squeeze Coded Computation ($S^2C^2$). $S^2C^2$ squeezes the compute slack (i.e., overhead) that is built into the coded computing frameworks by efficiently assigning work for all fast and slow nodes according to their speeds and without needing to re-distribute data. We implement an LSTM-based speed prediction algorithm to predict speeds of compute nodes. We evaluate $S^2C^2$ on linear algebraic algorithms, gradient descent, graph ranking, and graph filtering algorithms. We demonstrate 19% to 39% reduction in total computation latency using $S^2C^2$ compared to job replication and coded computation. We further show how $S^2C^2$ can be applied beyond matrix-vector multiplication.			arxiv	['Zhifeng Lin', 'Mehrdad Kiamari', 'Salman Avestimehr', 'Murali Annavaram']	88.0
338	Quantum-Inspired Computing: Can it be a Microscopic Computing Model of the Brain?	Yasunao Katayama	2019-04-11 01:12:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10508v2	Quantum computing and the workings of the brain have many aspects in common and have been attracting increasing attention in academia and industry. The computation in both is parallel and non-discrete. Though the underlying physical dynamics (e.g., equation of motion) may be deterministic, the observed or interpreted outcomes are often probabilistic. Consequently, various investigations have been undertaken to understand and reproduce the brain on the basis of quantum physics and computing. However, there have been arguments on whether the brain can and have to take advantage of quantum phenomena that need to survive in the macroscopic space-time region at room temperature. This paper presents a unique microscopic computational model for the brain based on an ansatz that the brain computes in a manner similar to quantum computing, but with classical waves. Log-scale encoding of information in the context of computing with waves is shown to play a critical role in bridging the computing models with classical and quantum waves. Our quantum-inspired computing model opens up a possibility of unifying the computing framework of artificial intelligence and quantum computing beyond quantum machine learning approaches.			arxiv	[]	89.0
339	Analog Computation and Representation	Corey J. Maley	2020-12-10 20:44:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05965v1	Relative to digital computation, analog computation has been neglected in the philosophical literature. To the extent that attention has been paid to analog computation, it has been misunderstood. The received view -- that analog computation has to do essentially with continuity -- is simply wrong, as shown by careful attention to historical examples of discontinuous, discrete analog computers. Instead of the received view, I develop an account of analog computation in terms of a particular type of analog representation that allows for discontinuity. This account thus characterizes all types of analog computation, whether continuous or discrete. Furthermore, the structure of this account can be generalized to other types of computation: analog computation essentially involves analog representation, whereas digital computation essentially involves digital representation. Besides being a necessary component of a complete philosophical understanding of computation in general, understanding analog computation is important for computational explanation in contemporary neuroscience and cognitive science.			arxiv	[]	90.0
340	Consideration of the Need for Quantum Grid Computing	Dominic Rosch-Grace	2021-06-21 18:19:22	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11341v1	Quantum computing is poised to dramatically change the computational landscape, worldwide. Quantum computers can solve complex problems that are, at least in some cases, beyond the ability of even advanced future classical-style computers. In addition to being able to solve these classical computer-unsolvable problems, quantum computers have demonstrated a capability to solve some problems (such as prime factoring) much more efficiently than classical computing. This will create problems for encryption techniques, which depend on the difficulty of factoring for their security. Security, scientific, and other applications will require access to quantum computing resources to access their unique capabilities, speed and economic (aggregate computing time cost) benefits. Many scientific applications, as well as numerous other ones, use grid computing to provide benefits such as scalability and resource access. As these applications may benefit from quantum capabilities - and some future applications may require quantum capabilities - identifying how to integrate quantum computing systems into grid computing environments is critical. This paper discusses the benefits of grid-connected quantum computers and what is required to achieve this.			arxiv	['Jeremy Straub']	91.0

In this MEC system, we focus on three computing schemes: (i) The local computing scheme where all computational tasks are computed by the local server at the UE, (ii) The edge computing scheme where all computational tasks are computed by the edge server at the BS, and (iii) The partial computing scheme where computational tasks are partially allocated at the edge server and the rest are computed by the local server. Considering exponentially distributed transmission time and computation time and adopting the first come first serve (FCFS) queuing policy, we derive closed-form expressions for the average AoI and average PAoI. To address the complexity of the average AoI expression, we derive simple upper and lower bounds on the average AoI, which allow us to explicitly examine the dependence of the optimal offloading decision on the MEC system parameters. Aided by simulation results, we verify our analysis and illustrate the impact of system parameters on the AoI performance.			arxiv	['Zhuo Sun', 'Nan Yang', 'Xiangyun Zhou']	93.0
343	Computation Environments, An Interactive Semantics for Turing Machines (which P is not equal to NP considering it)	Rasoul Ramezanian	2012-05-27 19:21:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5994v1	To scrutinize notions of computation and time complexity, we introduce and formally define an interactive model for computation that we call it the \emph{computation environment}. A computation environment consists of two main parts: i) a universal processor and ii) a computist who uses the computability power of the universal processor to perform effective procedures. The notion of computation finds it meaning, for the computist, through his \underline{interaction} with the universal processor. We are interested in those computation environments which can be considered as alternative for the real computation environment that the human being is its computist. These computation environments must have two properties: 1- being physically plausible, and 2- being enough powerful. Based on Copeland' criteria for effective procedures, we define what a \emph{physically plausible} computation environment is. We construct two \emph{physically plausible} and \emph{enough powerful} computation environments: 1- the Turing computation environment, denoted by $E_T$, and 2- a persistently evolutionary computation environment, denoted by $E_e$, which persistently evolve in the course of executing the computations. We prove that the equality of complexity classes $\mathrm{P}$ and $\mathrm{NP}$ in the computation environment $E_e$ conflicts with the \underline{free will} of the computist. We provide an axiomatic system $\mathcal{T}$ for Turing computability and prove that ignoring just one of the axiom of $\mathcal{T}$, it would not be possible to derive $\mathrm{P=NP}$ from the rest of axioms. We prove that the computist who lives inside the environment $E_T$, can never be confident that whether he lives in a static environment or a persistently evolutionary one.			arxiv	[]	94.0
344	When does a physical system compute?	Dominic Horsman	2013-09-30 19:37:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7979v3	Computing is a high-level process of a physical system. Recent interest in non-standard computing systems, including quantum and biological computers, has brought this physical basis of computing to the forefront. There has been, however, no consensus on how to tell if a given physical system is acting as a computer or not; leading to confusion over novel computational devices, and even claims that every physical event is a computation. In this paper we introduce a formal framework that can be used to determine whether or not a physical system is performing a computation. We demonstrate how the abstract computational level interacts with the physical device level, drawing the comparison with the use of mathematical models to represent physical objects in experimental science. This powerful formulation allows a precise description of the similarities between experiments, computation, simulation, and technology, leading to our central conclusion: physical computing is the use of a physical system to predict the outcome of an abstract evolution. We give conditions that must be satisfied in order for computation to be occurring, and illustrate these with a range of non-standard computing scenarios. The framework also covers broader computing contexts, where there is no obvious human computer user. We define the critical notion of a 'computational entity', and show the role this plays in defining when computing is taking place in physical systems.			arxiv	['Susan Stepney', 'Rob C.

It is based on the key concept that future computing resources will be coupled with communication resources, for enhancing user experience of the connected users, and also for optimising resources in the providers' infrastructures. Such coupling is achieved by Joint/Cooperative resource allocation algorithms, by integrating computing and communication services and by integrating hardware in networks. Such type of computing, by which computing services are not delivered independently but dependent of networking services, is named Aqua Computing. The authors see Aqua Computing as a novel approach for delivering computing resources to end devices, where computing power of the devices are enhanced automatically once they are connected to an Aqua Computing enabled network. The process of resource coupling is named computation dissolving.

346	"Exploring the landscapes of ""computing"": digital, neuromorphic, unconventional -- and beyond"	Herbert Jaeger	2020-11-24 10:37:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12013v3	"The acceleration race of digital computing technologies seems to be steering toward impasses -- technological, economical and environmental -- a condition that has spurred research efforts in alternative, ""neuromorphic"" (brain-like) computing technologies. Furthermore, since decades the idea of exploiting nonlinear physical phenomena ""directly"" for non-digital computing has been explored under names like ""unconventional computing"", ""natural computing"", ""physical computing"", or ""in-materio computing"". This has been taking place in niches which are small compared to other sectors of computer science. In this paper I stake out the grounds of how a general concept of ""computing"" can be developed which comprises digital, neuromorphic, unconventional and possible future ""computing"" paradigms. The main contribution of this paper is a wide-scope survey of existing formal conceptualizations of ""computing"". The survey inspects approaches rooted in three different kinds of background mathematics: discrete-symbolic formalisms, probabilistic modeling, and dynamical-systems oriented views. It turns out that different choices of background mathematics lead to decisively different understandings of what ""computing"" is. Across all of this diversity, a unifying coordinate system for theorizing about ""computing"" can be distilled. Within these coordinates I locate anchor points for a foundational formal theory of a future computing-engineering discipline that includes, but will reach beyond, digital and neuromorphic computing."			arxiv	[]	97.0

374	How to Optimally Allocate Resources for Coded Distributed Computing?	Qian Yu	2017-02-23 17:06:39	http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07297v1	Today's data centers have an abundance of computing resources, hosting server clusters consisting of as many as tens or hundreds of thousands of machines. To execute a complex computing task over a data center, it is natural to distribute computations across many nodes to take advantage of parallel processing. However, as we allocate more and more computing resources to a computation task and further distribute the computations, large amounts of (partially) computed data must be moved between consecutive stages of computation tasks among the nodes, hence the communication load can become the bottleneck. In this paper, we study the optimal allocation of computing resources in distributed computing, in order to minimize the total execution time in distributed computing accounting for both the duration of computation and communication phases. In particular, we consider a general MapReduce-type distributed computing framework, in which the computation is decomposed into three stages: \emph{Map}, \emph{Shuffle}, and \emph{Reduce}. We focus on a recently proposed \emph{Coded Distributed Computing} approach for MapReduce and study the optimal allocation of computing resources in this framework. For all values of problem parameters, we characterize the optimal number of servers that should be used for distributed processing, provide the optimal placements of the Map and Reduce tasks, and propose an optimal coded data shuffling scheme, in order to minimize the total execution time. To prove the optimality of the proposed scheme, we first derive a matching information-theoretic converse on the execution time, then we prove that among all possible resource allocation schemes that achieve the minimum execution time, our proposed scheme uses the exactly minimum possible number of servers.			arxiv	['Songze Li', 'Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali', 'A.

375	The Complexity of Human Computation: A Concrete Model with an Application to Passwords	Manuel Blum	2017-07-05 03:25:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01204v1	"What can humans compute in their heads? We are thinking of a variety of Crypto Protocols, games like Sudoku, Crossword Puzzles, Speed Chess, and so on. The intent of this paper is to apply the ideas and methods of theoretical computer science to better understand what humans can compute in their heads. For example, can a person compute a function in their head so that an eavesdropper with a powerful computer --- who sees the responses to random input --- still cannot infer responses to new inputs? To address such questions, we propose a rigorous model of human computation and associated measures of complexity. We apply the model and measures first and foremost to the problem of (1) humanly computable password generation, and then consider related problems of (2) humanly computable ""one-way functions"" and (3) humanly computable ""pseudorandom generators"". The theory of Human Computability developed here plays by different rules than standard computability, and this takes some getting used to. For reasons to be made clear, the polynomial versus exponential time divide of modern computability theory is irrelevant to human computation. In human computability, the step-counts for both humans and computers must be more concrete. Specifically, we restrict the adversary to at most 10^24 (Avogadro number of) steps. An alternate view of this work is that it deals with the analysis of algorithms and counting steps for the case that inputs are small as opposed to the usual case of inputs large-in-the-limit."			arxiv	['Santosh Vempala']	127.0
376	A locality-based approach for coded computation	Michael Rudow	2020-02-06 18:46:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02440v1	Modern distributed computation infrastructures are often plagued by unavailabilities such as failing or slow servers. These unavailabilities adversely affect the tail latency of computation in distributed infrastructures. The simple solution of replicating computation entails significant resource overhead. Coded computation has emerged as a resource-efficient alternative, wherein multiple units of data are encoded to create parity units and the function to be computed is applied to each of these units on distinct servers. A decoder can use the available function outputs to decode the unavailable ones. Existing coded computation approaches are resource efficient only for simple variants of linear functions such as multilinear, with even the class of low degree polynomials requiring the same multiplicative overhead as replication for practically relevant straggler tolerance. In this paper, we present a new approach to model coded computation via the lens of locality of codes. We introduce a generalized notion of locality, denoted computational locality, building upon the locality of an appropriately defined code. We show that computational locality is equivalent to the required number of workers for coded computation and leverage results from the well-studied locality of codes to design coded computation schemes. We show that recent results on coded computation of multivariate polynomials can be derived using local recovering schemes for Reed-Muller codes. We present coded computation schemes for multivariate polynomials that adaptively exploit locality properties of input data-- an inadmissible technique under existing frameworks. These schemes require fewer workers than the lower bound under existing coded computation frameworks, showing that the existing multiplicative overhead on the number of servers is not fundamental for coded computation of nonlinear functions.			arxiv	['K.

377	Graph for Science: From API based Programming to Graph Engine based Programming for HPC	Yu Zhang	2023-12-08 08:33:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04900v1	Modern scientific applications predominantly run on large-scale computing platforms, necessitating collaboration between scientific domain experts and high-performance computing (HPC) experts. While domain experts are often skilled in customizing domain-specific scientific computing routines, which often involves various matrix computations, HPC experts are essential for achieving efficient execution of these computations on large-scale platforms. This process often involves utilizing complex parallel computing libraries tailored to specific matrix computation scenarios. However, the intricate programming procedure and the need for deep understanding in both application domains and HPC poses significant challenges to the widespread adoption of scientific computing. In this research, we observe that matrix computations can be transformed into equivalent graph representations, and that by utilizing graph processing engines, HPC experts can be freed from the burden of implementing efficient scientific computations. Based on this observation, we introduce a graph engine-based scientific computing (Graph for Science) paradigm, which provides a unified graph programming interface, enabling domain experts to promptly implement various types of matrix computations. The proposed paradigm leverages the underlying graph processing engine to achieve efficient execution, eliminating the needs for HPC expertise in programming large-scale scientific applications. Our results show that the graph engine-based scientific computing paradigm achieves performance comparable to the best-performing implementations based on existing parallel computing libraries and bespoke implementations. Importantly, the paradigm greatly simplifies the development of scientific computations on large-scale platforms, reducing the programming difficulty for scientists and facilitating broader adoption of scientific computing.			arxiv	['Zixiao Wang', 'Jin Zhao', 'Yuluo Guo', 'Hai Jin', 'Hui Yu', 'Zhiying Huang', 'Xuanhua Shi', 'Xiaofei Liao']	129.0
378	Distributed Computing for Localized and Multilayer Visualizations	Mark Burgin	2001-11-09 00:29:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0111022v1	The aim of this paper is to develop an approach to visualizations that benefits from distributed computing. Three schemes of process distribution are considered: parallel, pipeline, and expanding pipeline computations. Expanding pipeline structure synthesizes the advantages and traits of both parallel and pipeline computations. In expanding pipeline computing, a novel approach presented in this paper, a multiplicity of processes are concurrently developed in parallel and knotted processor pipelines. The theoretical foundations for expanding pipeline computing as a computational process are in the domains of alternating Turing machines, molecular computing, and E-machines. Expanding pipeline computing constitutes the development of the conventional pipeline architecture aimed at utilization of implicit parallel structures existing in algorithms. Such structures appear in various kinds of visualization. Image deriving and processing is a field that provides diverse opportunities for utilization of the advantages of distributed computing. The most relevant to the distributed architecture is stratified visualization with its two cases based on data localization and layer separation. Visualization is treated here as a special case of simulation. The conceptual approach to distributed computing developed in this paper have been applied to visualization in a computer support system, which is utilized in radiology and namely, for the noninvasive treatment of brain aneurysms.			arxiv	['Walter Karplus', 'Damon Liu']	130.0

Of the different types of machines available for the task, we consider cluster computers. The use of clusters of commodity computers in high performance computing has many advantages including the raw price/performance ratio and the flexibility of machine configuration and upgrade.

Wolpert	2000-05-23 00:51:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0005058v1	In this first of two papers, strong limits on the accuracy of physical computation are established. First it is proven that there cannot be a physical computer C to which one can pose any and all computational tasks concerning the physical universe. Next it is proven that no physical computer C can correctly carry out any computational task in the subset of such tasks that can be posed to C. As a particular example, this means that there cannot be a physical computer that can, for any physical system external to that computer, take the specification of that external system's state as input and then correctly predict its future state before that future state actually occurs. The results also mean that there cannot exist an infallible, general-purpose observation apparatus, and that there cannot be an infallible, general-purpose control apparatus. These results do not rely on systems that are infinite, and/or non-classical, and/or obey chaotic dynamics. They also hold even if one uses an infinitely fast, infinitely dense computer, with computational powers greater than that of a Turing Machine.			arxiv	[]	132.0

Although we do not yet have a quantum theory of the gravitational field, and are far from a practical implementation of a quantum field computer, some pieces of the puzzle (without gravity) are now available. We consider a general model for computation with quantum field theory, and obtain some results for relativistic quantum computation. Moreover, it is possible to see new connections between principal models of computation, namely, computation over the continuum and computation over the integers (Turing computation). Thus we identify a basic problem in QFT, namely Wightman's computation problem for domains of holomorphy, which we call WHOLO. Inspired by the same analytic functions which are central to the famous CPT theorem of QFT, it is possible to obtain a computational complexity structure for QFT and shed new light on certain complexity classes for this problem WHOLO.			arxiv	[]	133.0
382	Two Remarkable Computational Competencies of the Simple Genetic Algorithm	Keki M. Burjorjee	2008-10-19 01:08:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3357v2	Since the inception of genetic algorithmics the identification of computational efficiencies of the simple genetic algorithm (SGA) has been an important goal. In this paper we distinguish between a computational competency of the SGA--an efficient, but narrow computational ability--and a computational proficiency of the SGA--a computational ability that is both efficient and broad. Till date, attempts to deduce a computational proficiency of the SGA have been unsuccessful. It may, however, be possible to inductively infer a computational proficiency of the SGA from a set of related computational competencies that have been deduced. With this in mind we deduce two computational competencies of the SGA. These competencies, when considered together, point toward a remarkable computational proficiency of the SGA.

We work in a general framework (computable metric spaces, computable measures and functions) where this problem can be posed precisely. We consider invariant measures as fixed points of the transfer operator and give general conditions under which the transfer operator is (sufficiently) computable. In this case, a general result ensures the computability of isolated fixed points and hence invariant measures (in given classes of ""regular"" measures). This implies the computability of many SRB measures. On the other hand, not all computable dynamical systems have a computable invariant measure. We exhibit two interesting examples of computable dynamics, one having an SRB measure which is not computable and another having no computable invariant measure at all, showing some subtlety in this kind of problems."			arxiv	['Mathieu Hoyrup', 'Cristobal Rojas']	135.0

This paper discusses some of the research challenges for cloud computing from an enterprise or organizational perspective, and puts them in context by reviewing the existing body of literature in cloud computing. Various research challenges relating to the following topics are discussed: the organizational changes brought about by cloud computing; the economic and organizational implications of its utility billing model; the security, legal and privacy issues that cloud computing raises. It is important to highlight these research challenges because cloud computing is not simply about a technological improvement of data centers but a fundamental change in how IT is provisioned and used. This type of research has the potential to influence wider adoption of cloud computing in enterprise, and in the consumer market too."			arxiv	['Ian Sommerville', 'Ilango Sriram']	136.0

Jockusch Jr.	2010-10-25 18:02:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.5212v1	Generic computability has been studied in group theory and we now study it in the context of classical computability theory. A set A of natural numbers is generically computable if there is a partial computable function f whose domain has density 1 and which agrees with the characteristic function of A on its domain. A set A is coarsely computable if there is a computable set C such that the symmetric difference of A and C has density 0. We prove that there is a c.e. set which is generically computable but not coarsely computable and vice versa. We show that every nonzero Turing degree contains a set which is not coarsely computable. We prove that there is a c.e. set of density 1 which has no computable subset of density 1. As a corollary, there is a generically computable set A such that no generic algorithm for A has computable domain. We define a general notion of generic reducibility in the spirt of Turing reducibility and show that there is a natural order-preserving embedding of the Turing degrees into the generic degrees which is not surjective.			arxiv	['Paul E.

386	Experimental verification of quantum computations	Stefanie Barz	2013-08-30 20:00:02	http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0005v1	Quantum computers are expected to offer substantial speedups over their classical counterparts and to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers. Beyond such practical significance, the concept of quantum computation opens up new fundamental questions, among them the issue whether or not quantum computations can be certified by entities that are inherently unable to compute the results themselves. Here we present the first experimental verification of quantum computations. We show, in theory and in experiment, how a verifier with minimal quantum resources can test a significantly more powerful quantum computer. The new verification protocol introduced in this work utilizes the framework of blind quantum computing and is independent of the experimental quantum-computation platform used. In our scheme, the verifier is only required to generate single qubits and transmit them to the quantum computer. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol using four photonic qubits and show how the verifier can test the computer's ability to perform measurement-based quantum computations.			arxiv	['Joseph F.

Cloud computing is a set of resources and services that are offered by the network or internet. Cloud computing extends various computing techniques like grid computing, distributed computing. Today cloud computing is used in both industrial field and academic field. Cloud facilitates its users by providing virtual resources via internet. As the field of cloud computing is spreading the new techniques are developing. This increase in cloud computing environment also increases security challenges for cloud developers. Users of cloud save their data in the cloud hence the lack of security in cloud can lose the users trust. In this paper we will discuss some of the cloud security issues in various aspects like multi-tenancy, elasticity, availability etc. The paper also discuss existing security techniques and approaches for a secure cloud.

Currently, IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) are used as a business model for Cloud Computing. Nowadays, the adoption and deployment of Cloud Computing is increasing in various domains, forcing researchers to conduct research in the area of Cloud Computing globally. Setting up the research environment is critical for the researchers in the developing countries to evaluate the research outputs. Currently, modeling, simulation technology and access of resources from various university data centers has become a useful and powerful tool in cloud computing research.

Cloud delivers computing as a utility as it is available to the cloud consumers on demand. It is a simple pay-per-use consumer-provider service model. It contains large number of shared resources. So Resource Management is always a major issue in cloud computing like any other computing paradigm. Due to the availability of finite resources it is very challenging for cloud providers to provide all the requested resources. From the cloud providers perspective cloud resources must be allocated in a fair and efficient manner. Research Survey is not available from the perspective of resource management as a process in cloud computing. So this research paper provides a detailed sequential view / steps on resource management in cloud computing. Firstly this research paper classifies various resources in cloud computing. It also gives taxonomy on resource management in cloud computing through which one can do further research. Lastly comparisons on various resource management algorithms has been presented.			arxiv	['Narendra M Patel', 'Harshadkumar B Prajapati']	141.0
390	On the computability of graph Turing machines	Nathanael Ackerman	2017-03-28 05:53:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09406v1	We consider graph Turing machines, a model of parallel computation on a graph, in which each vertex is only capable of performing one of a finite number of operations. This model of computation is a natural generalization of several well-studied notions of computation, including ordinary Turing machines, cellular automata, and parallel graph dynamical systems. We analyze the power of computations that can take place in this model, both in terms of the degrees of computability of the functions that can be computed, and the time and space resources needed to carry out these computations. We further show that properties of the underlying graph have significant consequences for the power of computation thereby obtained. In particular, we show that every arithmetically definable set can be computed by a graph Turing machine in constant time, and that every computably enumerable Turing degree can be computed in constant time and linear space by a graph Turing machine whose underlying graph has finite degree.			arxiv	['Cameron Freer']	142.0
391	On Batch-Processing Based Coded Computing for Heterogeneous Distributed Computing Systems	Baoqian Wang	2019-12-29 00:57:45	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12559v3	In recent years, coded distributed computing (CDC) has attracted significant attention, because it can efficiently facilitate many delay-sensitive computation tasks against unexpected latencies in distributed computing systems. Despite such a salient feature, many design challenges and opportunities remain. In this paper, we focus on practical computing systems with heterogeneous computing resources, and design a novel CDC approach, called batch-processing based coded computing (BPCC), which exploits the fact that every computing node can obtain some coded results before it completes the whole task. To this end, we first describe the main idea of the BPCC framework, and then formulate an optimization problem for BPCC to minimize the task completion time by configuring the computation load. Through formal theoretical analyses, extensive simulation studies, and comprehensive real experiments on the Amazon EC2 computing clusters, we demonstrate promising performance of the proposed BPCC scheme, in terms of high computational efficiency and robustness to uncertain disturbances.			arxiv	['Junfei Xie', 'Kejie Lu', 'Yan Wan', 'Shengli Fu']	143.0

We first obtain an achievable communication load for any given computation load and any given function assignment at each node. The proposed file allocation strategy has two steps: first, the input files are partitioned into disjoint batches, each with possibly different size and computed by a distinct node; then, each node computes additional files from its non-computed files according to its redundant computation capability. In the Shuffle phase, coded multicasting opportunities are exploited thanks to the repetitive file allocation among different nodes. Based on this scheme, we further propose the computation-aware and the shuffle-aware function assignments. We prove that, by using proper function assignments, our achievable communication load for any given computation load is within a constant multiplicative gap to the optimum in an equivalent homogeneous system with the same average computation load. Numerical results show that our scheme with shuffle-aware function assignment achieves better computation-communication tradeoff than existing works in some cases.			arxiv	['Meixia Tao']	144.0
393	Computing Resource Allocation of Mobile Edge Computing Networks Based on Potential Game Theory	Heng Liu	2019-01-02 01:42:29	http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00233v1	Mobile edge computing (MEC) networks are one of the key technologies for ultra-reliability and low-latency communications. The computing resource allocation solution needs to be carefully designed to guarantee the computing resource efficiency of MEC networks. Based on the potential game theory, a computing resource allocation solution is proposed to reduce energy consumption and improve computing resource efficiency in MEC networks. The computing resource allocation solution includes two parts: the first part is the power control scheme based on the potential game theory and the second part is the computing resource allocation scheme based on linear programming. The power control scheme is to find a set of the transmission powers of base stations (BSs) that maximizes the potential function of MEC networks. The computing resource allocation scheme is to maximize the average computing resource allocation coefficient of the MEC networks based on the results of the power control scheme. Compared with traditional solutions, simulation results indicate the computing resource utilization and energy efficiency of the proposed computing resource allocation solution are significantly improved.			arxiv	['Haoming Jia', 'Jiaqi Chen', 'Xiaohu Ge', 'Yonghui Li', 'Lin Tian', 'Jinglin Shi']	145.0

Cloud is performing well in todays World and boosting the ability to use the internet more than ever. Cloud computing gradually developed a method to use the benefits of it in most of the organizations. Fog computing can be apparent both in big data structures and large cloud systems, making reference to the growing complications in retrieving the data accurately. Fog computing is outspreading cloud computing by transporting computation on the advantage of network systems such as cell phone devices or fixed nodes with in-built data storage. Fog provides important points of improved abilities, strong security controls, and processes, establish data transmission capabilities carefully and in a flexible manner. This paper gives an overview of the connections and attributes for both Fog computing and cloud varies by outline, preparation, directions, and strategies for associations and clients. This also explains how Fog computing is flexible and provide better service for data processing by overwhelming low network bandwidth instead of moving whole data to the cloud platform.			arxiv	[]	146.0
395	Physics Computational Literacy: An Exploratory Case Study Using Computational Essays	Tor Ole B. Odden	2019-10-08 10:18:28	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03316v2	Computation is becoming an increasingly important part of physics education. However, there are currently few theories of learning that can be used to help explain and predict the unique challenges and affordances associated with computation in physics. In this study, we adapt the existing theory of computational literacy, which posits that computational learning can be divided into material, cognitive, and social aspects, to the context of undergraduate physics. Based on an exploratory study of undergraduate physics computational literacy, using a newly-developed teaching tool known as a computational essay, we have identified a variety of student practices, knowledge, and beliefs across these three aspects of computational literacy. We illustrate these categories with data collected from students who engaged in an initial implementation of computational essays in an introductory electricity and magnetism class. We conclude by arguing that this framework can be used to theoretically diagnose student difficulties with computation, distinguish educational approaches that focus on material vs. cognitive aspects of computational literacy, and highlight the benefits and limitations of open-ended projects like computational essays to student learning.			arxiv	['Elise Lockwood', 'Marcos D.

396	When Services Computing Meets Blockchain: Challenges and Opportunities	Xiaoyun Li	2020-12-08 02:27:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04172v1	Services computing can offer a high-level abstraction to support diverse applications via encapsulating various computing infrastructures. Though services computing has greatly boosted the productivity of developers, it is faced with three main challenges: privacy and security risks, information silo, and pricing mechanisms and incentives. The recent advances of blockchain bring opportunities to address the challenges of services computing due to its build-in encryption as well as digital signature schemes, decentralization feature, and intrinsic incentive mechanisms. In this paper, we present a survey to investigate the integration of blockchain with services computing. The integration of blockchain with services computing mainly exhibits merits in two aspects: i) blockchain can potentially address key challenges of services computing and ii) services computing can also promote blockchain development. In particular, we categorize the current literature of services computing based on blockchain into five types: services creation, services discovery, services recommendation, services composition, and services arbitration. Moreover, we generalize Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) architecture and summarize the representative BaaS platforms. In addition, we also outline open issues of blockchain-based services computing and BaaS.			arxiv	['Zibin Zheng', 'Hong-Ning Dai']	148.0

Aly	2021-05-04 18:58:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01707v1	With parallel and distributed computing (PDC) now wide-spread, modern computing programs must incorporate PDC within the curriculum. ACM and IEEE Computer Society's Computer Science curricular guidelines have recommended exposure to PDC concepts since 2013. More recently, a variety of initiatives have made PDC curricular content, lectures, and labs freely available for undergraduate computer science programs. Despite these efforts, progress in ensuring computer science students graduate with sufficient PDC exposure has been uneven. This paper discusses the impact of ABET's revised criteria that have required exposure to PDC to achieve accreditation for computer science programs since 2018. The authors reviewed 20 top ABET-accredited computer science programs and analyzed how they covered the required PDC components in their curricula. Using their own institutions as case studies, the authors examine in detail how three different ABET-accredited computer science programs covered PDC using different approaches, yet meeting the PDC requirements of these ABET criteria. The paper also shows how ACM/IEEE Computer Society curricular guidelines for computer engineering and software engineering programs, along with ABET accreditation criteria, can cover PDC.			arxiv	['Haidar Harmanani', 'Rajendra K.

398	On the Arithmetic Complexity of the Bandwidth of Bandlimited Signals	Holger Boche	2022-02-04 02:10:49	http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11695v1	The bandwidth of a signal is an important physical property that is of relevance in many signal- and information-theoretic applications. In this paper we study questions related to the computability of the bandwidth of computable bandlimited signals. To this end we employ the concept of Turing computability, which exactly describes what is theoretically feasible and can be computed on a digital computer. Recently, it has been shown that there exist computable bandlimited signals with finite energy, the actual bandwidth of which is not a computable number, and hence cannot be computed on a digital computer. In this work, we consider the most general class of band-limited signals, together with different computable representations thereof. Among other things, our analysis includes a characterization of the arithmetic complexity of the bandwidth of such signals and yields a negative answer to the question of whether it is at least possible to compute non-trivial upper or lower bounds for the bandwidth of a bandlimited signal. Furthermore, we relate the problem of bandwidth computation to the theory of oracle machines. In particular, we consider halting and totality oracles, which belong to the most frequently investigated oracle machines in the theory of computation.			arxiv	['Yannik N. Böck', 'Ullrich J.

399	Optimal Stochastic Resource Allocation for Distributed Quantum Computing	Napat Ngoenriang	2022-09-16 02:37:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02886v1	With the advent of interconnected quantum computers, i.e., distributed quantum computing (DQC), multiple quantum computers can now collaborate via quantum networks to perform massively complex computational tasks. However, DQC faces problems sharing quantum information because it cannot be cloned or duplicated between quantum computers. Thanks to advanced quantum mechanics, quantum computers can teleport quantum information across quantum networks. However, challenges to utilizing efficiently quantum resources, e.g., quantum computers and quantum channels, arise in DQC due to their capabilities and properties, such as uncertain qubit fidelity and quantum channel noise. In this paper, we propose a resource allocation scheme for DQC based on stochastic programming to minimize the total deployment cost for quantum resources. Essentially, the two-stage stochastic programming model is formulated to handle the uncertainty of quantum computing demands, computing power, and fidelity in quantum networks. The performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and ability of the proposed scheme to balance the utilization of quantum computers and on-demand quantum computers while minimizing the overall cost of provisioning under uncertainty.			arxiv	['Minrui Xu', 'Sucha Supittayapornpong', 'Dusit Niyato', 'Han Yu', 'Xuemin', 'Shen']	151.0
400	Quantum Computing Enhanced Distance-Minimizing Data-Driven Computational Mechanics	Yongchun Xu	2023-06-14 07:22:52	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08305v1	The distance-minimizing data-driven computational mechanics has great potential in engineering applications by eliminating material modeling error and uncertainty. In this computational framework, the solution-seeking procedure relies on minimizing the distance between the constitutive database and the conservation law. However, the distance calculation is time-consuming and often takes up most of the computational time in the case of a huge database. In this paper, we show how to use quantum computing to enhance data-driven computational mechanics by exponentially reducing the computational complexity of distance calculation. The proposed method is not only validated on the quantum computer simulator Qiskit, but also on the real quantum computer from OriginQ. We believe that this work represents a promising step towards integrating quantum computing into data-driven computational mechanics.			arxiv	['Jie Yang', 'Zengtao Kuang', 'Qun Huang', 'Wei Huang', 'Heng Hu']	152.0
401	Solving Partial Differential Equations with Monte Carlo / Random Walk on an Analog-Digital Hybrid Computer	Dirk Killat	2023-09-11 16:24:53	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05598v1	Current digital computers are about to hit basic physical boundaries with respect to integration density, clock frequencies, and particularly energy consumption. This requires the application of new computing paradigms, such as quantum and analog computing in the near future. Although neither quantum nor analog computer are general purpose computers they will play an important role as co-processors to offload certain classes of compute intensive tasks from classic digital computers, thereby not only reducing run time but also and foremost power consumption. In this work, we describe a random walk approach to the solution of certain types of partial differential equations which is well suited for combinations of digital and analog computers (hybrid computers). The experiments were performed on an Analog Paradigm Model-1 analog computer attached to a digital computer by means of a hybrid interface. At the end we give some estimates of speedups and power consumption obtainable by using future analog computers on chip.			arxiv	['Sven Köppel', 'Bernd Ulmann', 'Lucas Wetzel']	153.0
402	Average value estimation in nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation	Guo-Fu Xu	2023-11-09 02:54:35	http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05110v1	Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation has been attracting continuous attention since it was proposed. Until now, various schemes of nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation have been developed and many of them have been experimentally demonstrated. It is known that at the end of a computation, one usually needs to estimate the average value of an observable. However, computation errors severely disturb the final state of a computation, causing erroneous average value estimation. Thus for nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation, an important topic is to investigate how to better give the average value of an observable under the condition of computation errors. While the above topic is important, the previous works in the field of nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation pay woefully inadequate attention to it. In this paper, we show that rescaling the measurement results can better give the average value of an observable in nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation when computation errors are considered. Particularly, we show that by rescaling the measurement results, $56.25\%$ of the computation errors can be reduced when using depolarizing noise model, a widely adopted noise model in quantum computation community, to analyse the benefit of our method.			arxiv	['P.

We compute conformal structures in the following way: first compute homology bases from simplicial complex structures, then construct dual cohomology bases and diffuse them to harmonic 1-forms. Next, we construct bases of holomorphic differentials. We then obtain period matrices by integrating holomorphic differentials along homology bases. We also study the global conformal mapping between genus zero surfaces and spheres, and between general meshes and planes. Our method of computing conformal structures can be applied to tackle fundamental problems in computer aid design and computer graphics, such as geometry classification and identification, and surface global parametrization.			arxiv	['Shing-Tung Yau']	155.0

Distributive categories have been proposed as a foundational tool for Computer Science in the last years, starting from the papers of R.F.C. Walters. We shall focus on two major topics: distributive computability, i.e., a generalized theory of computability based on distributive categories, and the Imp(G) language, which is a language based on the syntax of distributive categories. The link between the former and the latter is that the functions computed by Imp(G) programs are exactly the distributively computable functions.			arxiv	[]	156.0

A quantum computer threatens the security of public key encryption systems because these systems rely on the fact that prime factorization is computationally difficult. Errors limit the effectiveness of quantum computers. Because of the exponential nature of quantum com puters, simulating the effect of errors on them requires a vast amount of processing and memory resources.

We motivate the need for internal concepts of computability by observing that the complexity of the set of finite sets of closed balls with a nonempty intersection is not uniformly hyperarithmetical, and thus that approximating an externally computable function is highly complex."			arxiv	[]	165.0
414	Computability of the Radon-Nikodym derivative	Mathieu Hoyrup	2011-12-13 10:08:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2838v1	We study the computational content of the Radon-Nokodym theorem from measure theory in the framework of the representation approach to computable analysis. We define computable measurable spaces and canonical representations of the measures and the integrable functions on such spaces. For functions f,g on represented sets, f is W-reducible to g if f can be computed by applying the function g at most once. Let RN be the Radon-Nikodym operator on the space under consideration and let EC be the non-computable operator mapping every enumeration of a set of natural numbers to its characteristic function. We prove that for every computable measurable space, RN is W-reducible to EC, and we construct a computable measurable space for which EC is W-reducible to RN.			arxiv	['Cristobal Rojas', 'Klaus Weihrauch']	166.0

Different access to computational resources may result in a kind of economic asymmetry analogous to information asymmetry. In order to represent strategic computational choices within a game theoretic framework, we propose a new game specification, Strategic Bayesian Networks (SBN). In an SBN, random variables are represented as nodes in a graph, with edges indicating probabilistic dependence. For some nodes, players can choose conditional probability distributions as a strategic choice. Using SBN, we present two games that demonstrate computational asymmetry. These games are symmetric except for the computational limitations of the actors. We show that the better computationally endowed player receives greater payoff.			arxiv	['John Chuang']	167.0

419	On the information carried by programs about the objects they compute	Mathieu Hoyrup	2014-09-24 14:47:17	http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6977v1	In computability theory and computable analysis, finite programs can compute infinite objects. Presenting a computable object via any program for it, provides at least as much information as presenting the object itself, written on an infinite tape. What additional information do programs provide? We characterize this additional information to be any upper bound on the Kolmogorov complexity of the object. Hence we identify the exact relationship between Markov-computability and Type-2-computability. We then use this relationship to obtain several results characterizing the computational and topological structure of Markov-semidecidable sets.			arxiv	['Cristobal Rojas']	171.0

Our results can be seen as bounds on how different BSS-computability and computability in the sense of computable analysis can be. The framework for this is Weihrauch reducibility. As a consequence of our characterizations, we establish that the solvability complexity index is (mostly) independent of the computational model, and that there thus is common ground in the study of non-computability between the BSS and TTE setting.			arxiv	['Arno Pauly']	174.0

We extend the existing literature by deriving an inequality (Eq. 4) that relates computation offloading system parameters to the bits per instruction ratio of a computational job. This ratio is the inverse of the arithmetic intensity. We then discuss how this inequality can be used to determine the computations that can benefit from offloading as well as the computation offloading systems required to make offloading beneficial for particular computations.			arxiv	['Michael P.

424	Distributed Gradient Descent with Coded Partial Gradient Computations	Emre Ozfatura	2018-11-22 18:39:40	http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09271v1	Coded computation techniques provide robustness against straggling servers in distributed computing, with the following limitations: First, they increase decoding complexity. Second, they ignore computations carried out by straggling servers; and they are typically designed to recover the full gradient, and thus, cannot provide a balance between the accuracy of the gradient and per-iteration completion time. Here we introduce a hybrid approach, called coded partial gradient computation (CPGC), that benefits from the advantages of both coded and uncoded computation schemes, and reduces both the computation time and decoding complexity.			arxiv	['Sennur Ulukus', 'Deniz Gunduz']	176.0

Fuzzy set theory is a mathematical model of vagueness that has been used to define vague models of computation. The prominent model of vague computation is the fuzzy Turing machine. This conceptual computing device gives an idea of what computing under vagueness means, nevertheless, it is not the most natural model. Based on the properties of this and other models of vague computing, it is aimed to formulate a basis for a philosophy of a theory of fuzzy computation.			arxiv	[]	178.0

Two previous qualitative studies of instructor attitudes found results identical to those from other disciplines, but neither study considered whether instructors perceive student motivation to be more important in certain computing classes. In this work we present quantitative results about the perceived importance of student motivation in computing courses on the part of computing educators. Our survey results show that while a majority of respondents believe student motivation is necessary in all computing courses, the structure and audience in certain computing classes elevate the importance of student motivation.			arxiv	['Brian Sedlak']	179.0

Graça	2021-09-30 12:44:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15080v1	Turing computability is the standard computability paradigm which captures the computational power of digital computers. To understand whether one can create physically realistic devices which have super-Turing power, one needs to understand whether it is possible to obtain systems with super-Turing capabilities which also have other desirable properties such as robustness to perturbations. In this paper we introduce a framework for analyzing whether a non-computability result is robust over continuous spaces. Then we use this framework to study the degree of robustness of several non-computability results which involve the wave equation, differentiation, and basins of attraction.			arxiv	['Ning Zhong']	184.0
433	Quantum logic as reversible computing	Basil Evangelidis	2021-11-14 19:51:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07431v1	The relation between entropy and information has great significance for computation. Based on the strict reversibility of the laws of microphysics, Landauer (1961), Bennett (1973), Priese (1976), Fredkin and Toffoli (1982), Feynman (1985) and others envisioned a reversible computer that cannot allow any ambiguity in backward steps of a calculation. It is this backward capacity that makes reversible computing radically different from ordinary, irreversible computing. The proposal aims at a higher kind of computer that would give the actual output of a computation together with the original input, with the absence of a minimum energy requirement. Hence, information retrievability and energy efficiency due to diminished heat dissipation are the exquisite tasks of quantum computer technology.			arxiv	[]	185.0

However, these publications do not include a rigorous proof of this advantage, which would have to minimally state that the class of problems decidable by a quantum computer in polynomial time, BQP, contains problems that are not in the class of problems decidable by a classical computer with similar time bounds, P. Here, I provide the proof of a stronger result that implies this result: BQP contains problems that lie beyond the much larger classical computing class NP. This proves that quantum computation is able to efficiently solve problems which are far beyond the capabilities of classical computers.			arxiv	[]	189.0

Computation and communication delays are assumed to be random, and redundant computations are assigned to workers in order to tolerate stragglers. We consider sequential computation of tasks assigned to a worker, while the result of each computation is sent to the master right after its completion. Each computation round, which can model an iteration of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, is completed once the master receives k distinct computations, referred to as the computation target. Our goal is to characterize the average completion time as a function of the computation load, which denotes the portion of the dataset available at each worker, and the computation target. We propose two computation scheduling schemes that specify the tasks assigned to each worker, as well as their computation schedule, i.e., the order of execution. Assuming a general statistical model for computation and communication delays, we derive the average completion time of the proposed schemes. We also establish a lower bound on the minimum average completion time by assuming prior knowledge of the random delays. Experimental results carried out on Amazon EC2 cluster show a significant reduction in the average completion time over existing coded and uncoded computing schemes. It is also shown numerically that the gap between the proposed scheme and the lower bound is relatively small, confirming the efficiency of the proposed scheduling design.			arxiv	['Deniz Gunduz']	210.0

461	Quantum State Optimization and Computational Pathway Evaluation for Gate-Model Quantum Computers	Laszlo Gyongyosi	2020-03-11 12:20:37	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05255v1	A computational problem fed into a gate-model quantum computer identifies an objective function with a particular computational pathway (objective function connectivity). The solution of the computational problem involves identifying a target objective function value that is the subject to be reached. A bottleneck in a gate-model quantum computer is the requirement of several rounds of quantum state preparations, high-cost run sequences, and multiple rounds of measurements to determine a target (optimal) state of the quantum computer that achieves the target objective function value. Here, we define a method for optimal quantum state determination and computational path evaluation for gate-model quantum computers. We prove a state determination method that finds a target system state for a quantum computer at a given target objective function value. The computational pathway evaluation procedure sets the connectivity of the objective function in the target system state on a fixed hardware architecture of the quantum computer. The proposed solution evolves the target system state without requiring the preparation of intermediate states between the initial and target states of the quantum computer. Our method avoids high-cost system state preparations and expensive running procedures and measurement apparatuses in gate-model quantum computers. The results are convenient for gate-model quantum computations and the near-term quantum devices of the quantum Internet.			arxiv	[]	214.0

465	Revisiting thermodynamics in computation and information theory	Pritam Chattopadhyay	2021-02-19 15:24:45	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09981v1	One of the primary motivations of the research in the field of computation is to optimize the cost of computation. The major ingredient that a computer needs is the energy to run a process, i.e., the thermodynamic cost. The analysis of the thermodynamic cost of computation is one of the prime focuses of research. It started back since the seminal work of Landauer where it was commented that the computer spends kB T ln2 amount of energy to erase a bit of information (here T is the temperature of the system and kB represents the Boltzmann's constant). The advancement of statistical mechanics has provided us the necessary tool to understand and analyze the thermodynamic cost for the complicated processes that exist in nature, even the computation of modern computers. The advancement of physics has helped us to understand the connection of the statistical mechanics (the thermodynamics cost) with computation. Another important factor that remains a matter of concern in the field of computer science is the error correction of the error that occurs while transmitting the information through a communication channel. Here in this article, we have reviewed the progress of the thermodynamics of computation starting from Landauer's principle to the latest model, which simulates the modern complex computation mechanism. After exploring the salient parts of computation in computer science theory and information theory, we have reviewed the thermodynamic cost of computation and error correction. We have also discussed about the alternative computation models that have been proposed with thermodynamically cost-efficient.			arxiv	['Goutam Paul']	218.0

467	PIM-Enclave: Bringing Confidential Computation Inside Memory	Kha Dinh Duy	2021-11-05 07:50:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03307v1	Demand for data-intensive workloads and confidential computing are the prominent research directions shaping the future of cloud computing. Computer architectures are evolving to accommodate the computing of large data better. Protecting the computation of sensitive data is also an imperative yet challenging objective; processor-supported secure enclaves serve as the key element in confidential computing in the cloud. However, side-channel attacks are threatening their security boundaries. The current processor architectures consume a considerable portion of its cycles in moving data. Near data computation is a promising approach that minimizes redundant data movement by placing computation inside storage. In this paper, we present a novel design for Processing-In-Memory (PIM) as a data-intensive workload accelerator for confidential computing. Based on our observation that moving computation closer to memory can achieve efficiency of computation and confidentiality of the processed information simultaneously, we study the advantages of confidential computing \emph{inside} memory. We then explain our security model and programming model developed for PIM-based computation offloading. We construct our findings into a software-hardware co-design, which we call PIM-Enclave. Our design illustrates the advantages of PIM-based confidential computing acceleration. Our evaluation shows PIM-Enclave can provide a side-channel resistant secure computation offloading and run data-intensive applications with negligible performance overhead compared to baseline PIM model.			arxiv	['Hojoon Lee']	220.0

Hoekstra	2007-03-19 13:25:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0703485v1	In this chapter we will argue that studying such multi-scale multi-science systems gives rise to inherently hybrid models containing many different algorithms best serviced by different types of computing environments (ranging from massively parallel computers, via large-scale special purpose machines to clusters of PC's) whose total integrated computing capacity can easily reach the PFlop/s scale. Such hybrid models, in combination with the by now inherently distributed nature of the data on which the models `feed' suggest a distributed computing model, where parts of the multi-scale multi-science model are executed on the most suitable computing environment, and/or where the computations are carried out close to the required data (i.e. bring the computations to the data instead of the other way around). We presents an estimate for the compute requirements to simulate the Galaxy as a typical example of a multi-scale multi-physics application, requiring distributed Petaflop/s computational power.			arxiv	['S.

Its formulas represent interactive computational problems, logical operators stand for operations on computational problems, and validity of a formula is understood as being a scheme of problems that always have algorithmic solutions. A comprehensive online source on the subject is available at http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html . The earlier article ""Propositional computability logic I"" proved soundness and completeness for the (in a sense) minimal nontrivial fragment CL1 of computability logic. The present paper extends that result to the significantly more expressive propositional system CL2. What makes CL2 more expressive than CL1 is the presence of two sorts of atoms in its language: elementary atoms, representing elementary computational problems (i.e. predicates), and general atoms, representing arbitrary computational problems. CL2 conservatively extends CL1, with the latter being nothing but the general-atom-free fragment of the former."			arxiv	[]	231.0

To this end, we equip the space of Lp-computable functions (computable Lebesgue integrable functions) with a size notion, by introducing Lp-computable Baire categories. We show that Lp-computable Baire categories satisfy the following three basic properties. Singleton sets {f} (where f is Lp-computable) are meager, suitable infinite unions of meager sets are meager, and the whole space of Lp-computable functions is not meager. We give an alternative characterization of meager sets via Banach Mazur games. We study the convergence of Fourier series for Lp-computable functions and show that whereas for every p>1, the Fourier series of every Lp-computable function f converges to f in the Lp norm, the set of L1-computable functions whose Fourier series does not diverge almost everywhere is meager.			arxiv	[]	233.0
476	Some Numerical Experiments on Round-off Error Growth in Finite Precision Numerical Computation	Suvarna Fadnavis	1998-07-01 09:23:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9807003v1	Finite precision computations using digital computers involve the following inherent errors: (1) Round-off error of finite precision computations (2) Binary computer arithmetic precludes exact number representation of traditional decimal system used in data input stage to the computer. Though the round-off error is as small as in the seventh decimal place (single precision) in the beginning, it can enter the mainstream computation within 50 iterations in iterative computations, such as that used in numerical integration schemes, for example, the commonly used fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Growth of round-off error in recursive vis-a-vis iterative computing is described in the text. In this paper several computational experiments are presented to demonstrate the rapid growth of round-off error in iterative computations.			arxiv	[]	234.0

Wolpert	2000-05-23 00:58:41	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0005059v1	In the first of this pair of papers, it was proven that that no physical computer can correctly carry out all computational tasks that can be posed to it. The generality of this result follows from its use of a novel definition of computation, ``physical computation''. This second paper of the pair elaborates the mathematical structure and impossibility results associated with physical computation. Analogues of Chomsky hierarcy results concerning universal Turing Machines and the Halting theorem are derived, as are results concerning the (im)possibility of certain kinds of error-correcting codes. In addition, an analogue of algorithmic information complexity, ``prediction complexity'', is elaborated. A task-independent bound is derived on how much the prediction complexity of a computational task can differ for two different universal physical computers used to solve that task, a bound similar to the ``encoding'' bound governing how much the algorithm information complexity of a Turing machine calculation can differ for two universal Turing machines. Finally, it is proven that either the Hamiltonian of our universe proscribes a certain type of computation, or prediction complexity is unique (unlike algorithmic information complexity).			arxiv	[]	235.0

480	Fault-tolerant quantum computation	Peter W. Shor	1996-05-13 14:29:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9605011v2	Recently, it was realized that use of the properties of quantum mechanics might speed up certain computations dramatically. Interest in quantum computation has since been growing. One of the main difficulties of realizing quantum computation is that decoherence tends to destroy the information in a superposition of states in a quantum computer, thus making long computations impossible. A futher difficulty is that inaccuracies in quantum state transformations throughout the computation accumulate, rendering the output of long computations unreliable. It was previously known that a quantum circuit with t gates could tolerate O(1/t) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate. We show, for any quantum computation with t gates, how to build a polynomial size quantum circuit that can tolerate O(1/(log t)^c) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate, for some constant c. We do this by showing how to compute using quantum error correcting codes. These codes were previously known to provide resistance to errors while storing and transmitting quantum data.			arxiv	[]	238.0

Some departments may lack the resources or commitment to create a dedicated course or program in computational physics. One way around this difficulty is to include computation in a standard upper-level physics course. An intermediate classical mechanics course is particularly well suited for including computation. We discuss the ways we have used computation in our classical mechanics courses, focusing on how computational work can improve students' understanding of physics as well as their computational skills. We present examples of computational problems that serve these two purposes. In addition, we provide information about resources for instructors who would like to include computation in their courses.			arxiv	['Javier E. Hasbun']	242.0

486	The Computable Universe Hypothesis	Matthew P. Szudzik	2010-03-27 18:28:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5831v6	When can a model of a physical system be regarded as computable? We provide the definition of a computable physical model to answer this question. The connection between our definition and Kreisel's notion of a mechanistic theory is discussed, and several examples of computable physical models are given, including models which feature discrete motion, a model which features non-discrete continuous motion, and probabilistic models such as radioactive decay. We show how computable physical models on effective topological spaces can be formulated using the theory of type-two effectivity (TTE). Various common operations on computable physical models are described, such as the operation of coarse-graining and the formation of statistical ensembles. The definition of a computable physical model also allows for a precise formalization of the computable universe hypothesis--the claim that all the laws of physics are computable.			arxiv	[]	245.0

Here we show the first such experimental demonstration of blind quantum computation where the input, computation, and output all remain unknown to the computer. We exploit the conceptual framework of measurement-based quantum computation that enables a client to delegate a computation to a quantum server. We demonstrate various blind delegated computations, including one- and two-qubit gates and the Deutsch and Grover algorithms. Remarkably, the client only needs to be able to prepare and transmit individual photonic qubits. Our demonstration is crucial for future unconditionally secure quantum cloud computing and might become a key ingredient for real-life applications, especially when considering the challenges of making powerful quantum computers widely available.			arxiv	['Elham Kashefi', 'Anne Broadbent', 'Joseph F.

Recently, there is a trend to apply distributed computing methods to networks of sub-microprocessor devices, e.g., biological cellular networks or networks of nano-devices. However, the suitability of the traditional distributed computing models to these types of networks is questionable: do tiny bio/nano nodes ""compute"" and/or ""communicate"" essentially the same as a computer? In this paper, we introduce a new model that depicts a network of randomized finite state machines operating in an asynchronous environment. Although the computation and communication capabilities of each individual device in the new model are, by design, much weaker than those of a computer, we show that some of the most important and extensively studied distributed computing problems can still be solved efficiently."			arxiv	['Jasmin Smula', 'Roger Wattenhofer']	249.0
489	Quantum Computation and Quantum Information	Yazhen Wang	2012-10-02 11:47:37	http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0736v1	Quantum computation and quantum information are of great current interest in computer science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will likely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication, computation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally stochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum algorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo techniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum computation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to revolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be generated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine random numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up median evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This paper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and quantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much faster than the available classic algorithms.

We show that computably compact computable metric spaces admit representations of their compact subsets in such a way that compact sets are essentially underspecified points. We can even ensure that a name of an $n$-element compact set contains $n$ occurrences of $\bot$. We undergo this study effectively and show that such a $\mathbb{T}^\omega$-representation is effectively obtained from structures of computably compact computable metric spaces. As an application, we prove some statements about the Weihrauch degree of closed choice for finite subsets of computably compact computable metric spaces. Along the way, we introduce the notion of a computable dyadic subbase, and prove that every computably compact computable metric space admits a proper computable dyadic subbase.			arxiv	['Hideki Tsuiki']	253.0
492	Space-Efficient Error Reduction for Unitary Quantum Computations	Bill Fefferman	2016-04-27 19:30:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08192v1	This paper develops general space-efficient methods for error reduction for unitary quantum computation. Consider a polynomial-time quantum computation with completeness $c$ and soundness $s$, either with or without a witness (corresponding to QMA and BQP, respectively). To convert this computation into a new computation with error at most $2^{-p}$, the most space-efficient method known requires extra workspace of ${O \bigl( p \log \frac{1}{c-s} \bigr)}$ qubits. This space requirement is too large for scenarios like logarithmic-space quantum computations. This paper presents error-reduction methods for unitary quantum computations (i.e., computations without intermediate measurements) that require extra workspace of just ${O \bigl( \log \frac{p}{c-s} \bigr)}$ qubits. This in particular gives the first methods of strong amplification for logarithmic-space unitary quantum computations with two-sided bounded error. This also leads to a number of consequences in complexity theory, such as the uselessness of quantum witnesses in bounded-error logarithmic-space unitary quantum computations, the PSPACE upper bound for QMA with exponentially-small completeness-soundness gap, and strong amplification for matchgate computations.			arxiv	['Hirotada Kobayashi', 'Cedric Yen-Yu Lin', 'Tomoyuki Morimae', 'Harumichi Nishimura']	254.0
493	A Game-Semantic Model of Computation	Norihiro Yamada	2017-02-16 18:27:19	http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05073v3	The present paper introduces a novel notion of `(effective) computability', called viability, of strategies in game semantics in an intrinsic (i.e., without recourse to the standard Church-Turing computability), non-inductive and non-axiomatic manner, and shows, as a main technical achievement, that viable strategies are Turing complete. Consequently, we have given a mathematical foundation of computation in the same sense as Turing machines but beyond computation on natural numbers, e.g., higher-order computation, in a more abstract fashion. As immediate corollaries, some of the well-known theorems in computability theory such as the smn-theorem and the first recursion theorem are generalized. Notably, our game-semantic framework distinguishes `high-level' computational processes that operate directly on mathematical objects such as natural numbers (not on their symbolic representations) and their `symbolic implementations' that define their `computability', which sheds new light on the very concept of computation. This work is intended to be a stepping stone towards a new mathematical foundation of computation, intuitionistic logic and constructive mathematics.			arxiv	[]	256.0
494	Temporal correlation detection using computational phase-change memory	Abu Sebastian	2017-06-01 22:10:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00511v1	For decades, conventional computers based on the von Neumann architecture have performed computation by repeatedly transferring data between their processing and their memory units, which are physically separated. As computation becomes increasingly data-centric and as the scalability limits in terms of performance and power are being reached, alternative computing paradigms are searched for in which computation and storage are collocated. A fascinating new approach is that of computational memory where the physics of nanoscale memory devices are used to perform certain computational tasks within the memory unit in a non-von Neumann manner. Here we present a large-scale experimental demonstration using one million phase-change memory devices organized to perform a high-level computational primitive by exploiting the crystallization dynamics. Also presented is an application of such a computational memory to process real-world data-sets. The results show that this co-existence of computation and storage at the nanometer scale could be the enabler for new, ultra-dense, low power, and massively parallel computing systems.			arxiv	['Tomas Tuma', 'Nikolaos Papandreou', 'Manuel Le Gallo', 'Lukas Kull', 'Thomas Parnell', 'Evangelos Eleftheriou']	257.0

The downside is that running tasks are sacrificed if the computer is needed for its primary use. Normally terminating the task which must be restarted on a different computer - leading to wasted energy and an increase in task completion time. We demonstrate, through the use of simulation, how we can reduce this wasted energy by targeting tasks at computers less likely to be needed for primary use, predicting this idle time through machine learning. By combining two machine learning approaches, namely Random Forest and MultiLayer Perceptron, we save 51.4% of the energy without significantly affecting the time to complete tasks.			arxiv	['Matthew Forshaw', 'John Brennan', 'Noura Al Moubayed', 'Stephen Bonner']	261.0
499	Edge Computing: A Comprehensive Survey of Current Initiatives and a Roadmap for a Sustainable Edge Computing Development	Andrea Hamm	2019-12-18 11:26:22	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08530v1	Edge Computing is a new distributed Cloud Computing paradigm in which computing and storage capabilities are pushed to the topological edge of a network. However, various standards and implementations are promoted by different initiatives. Lead by a reference architecture model for Edge Computing, current initiatives are analyzed by explorative content analysis. Providing two main contributions to the field, we present, first, how current initiatives are characterized, and second, a roadmap for sustainable Edge Computing relating three dimensions of sustainable development to four cross-concerns of Edge Computing. Findings show that most initiatives are internationally organized software development projects; important branches are currently telecom and industrial sectors; most addressed is the network virtualization layer. The roadmap reveals numerous chances and risks of Edge Computing related to sustainable development; such as the use of renewable energies, biases, new business models, increase and decrease of energy consumption, responsiveness, monitoring and traceability.			arxiv	['Alexander Willner', 'Ina Schieferdecker']	262.0
