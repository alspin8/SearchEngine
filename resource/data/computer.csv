1	Boyfriend has a ghost monitor	Unknown	2024-01-06 18:23:02	https://www.reddit.com/r/computer/comments/1906c40/boyfriend_has_a_ghost_monitor/	"We looked up a bunch of tutorials, deleted the monitors or pnp monitors, reinstalling the NVIDIA drivers, etc, nothing worked. He still had the ghost monitor. He only owns one monitor. Not sure what causes this issue, it happened out of nowhere one day. For now, we only have everything set to ""Display 2"", his real monitor. How do we get rid of the ghost monitor? Now it's causing games to appear on the ""ghost"" monitor like League of Legends, which doesn't have an option to select what monitor it opens on. Windows + Shift + Arrow doesn't work either. It happens with all of his games, needing OBS to even see what he's doing and it doesn't work for all games."	1.0	t3_1906c40	reddit

3	No more sound and dark screen in BIOS after installing new SSD	Unknown	2024-01-06 17:51:35	https://www.reddit.com/r/computer/comments/1905l9i/no_more_sound_and_dark_screen_in_bios_after/	I had two SSDs, one with Windows 10 installed and working fine, and another faulty SSD that I discarded. I installed the new SSD. Since that time, I have no sound in Windows and when going to BIOS I see nothing about sound and my scren in BIOS is really dark. I downloaded new audio drivers, but installing them does nothing, as Windows does not even detect sound in device manager. It's like I have no sound anymore. Audio was working fine before I installed the new SSD and I didn't touchthe old working SSD. It's on a laptop so is it possible I messed with something when I opened the laptop to install the new SSD and if so what can be done to correct the problem? BTW I tried to install Linux on the new SSD and screen is really dark too on live USB. Thanks	1.0	t3_1905l9i	reddit

TLDR: I don’t have physical or monetary access to pro laptop repair. So I replaced the fans in my Rog zephyrus GX502L got it to boot with all parts functioning, suddenly it shut off and I cannot get it to boot now. For context, I am in a remote town and have no easy or cheap access to a pc repair shop, I would have gone if I could. Recently the fans stopped working on my (out of warranty, refurbished) Asus Rog zephyrus. They were loud and not spinning properly. I did everything I could before finally deciding to order some new parts and do it myself. I did my research and took all precautions about static and the like. I after a while the new parts arrived and I managed to get them installed after a few hiccups. This is when I managed to get the laptop to start normally, the new fans spun and I reached the desktop. However as I went to check I hadn’t knocked the cpu out or something it suddenly shut off. Being at the end of a long day I decided to leave it till the next evening. Unfortunately, now only the keyboard and the “on light” flash before it stops. That only occurs after I do the whole “unplug the battery, button for 60 seconds” thing. I am new to this and very lost, in my home town I just went to the pc shop but I don’t have that option. So any advice is appreciated, even if it is “give up”.	1.0	t3_18zlt9x	reddit

I'll soon start my computer engineering university program, and I'm torn between purchasing a **14"" MacBook Pro with M1 chip or a 15"" MacBook Air with M2 chip.** My needs will involve programming, web browsing, video streaming, and the creation of some 3D models for 3D printing. What leads me to prefer the **MacBook Pro with M3** is the superior display (120Hz vs 60Hz), longer battery life, more available ports, and undoubtedly better performance. On the other hand, the **MacBook Air** would be more convenient for its lower price, and I am concerned that the Pro model may not be truly necessary for my needs. I don't deny, though, that the idea of having a MacBook Pro is very appealing to me, and at the moment, I am inclined to choose that one cause i just discovered that their weight is almost the same. However, I would like to hear your thoughts and discuss it below. ***Thanks to anyone who will help me <3***"	3.0	t3_18zha17	reddit

I have an Intel Optane H10 32gb with 512gb QLC SSD and I was eyeing the Samsung 970 Evo Plus 2tb as my main new SSD drive. Although, **I dunno if it would be the right choice for my needs so I'm here to ask you some opinions on the matter**. I know that, thanks to 3D XPoint memory technology, Intel Optane should be faster in boot up, random file access and light work than any other SSD while being actually worse with heavier and more sustained workloads, due to the limited cache and the slow QLC SSD that it's paired with. I often use Lightoom/Photoshop/DaVinci/Illustrator for some projects and sometimes I also game a little bit. **Will 970 Evo Plus make a positive difference on those scenarios or not?** Will I also gonna feel my pc as less responsive during light work like browsing and office work, as well as experiencing a slower boot up time (currently I have 1.8 second BIOS boot up time shown on task manager)?

Would I have to delete the partition on the D: drive, and if so how would I go about doing that? Appreciate the help!

The problem seems to occur randomly, making it challenging to pinpoint the root cause. There are times when my PC works flawlessly, and then there are instances where I'm plagued by frequent blue screens, rendering my system unusable. Recently, the situation has worsened to the point where every time I start my PC, I'm greeted by a blue screen notifying me that the system didn't start correctly, prompting me to either restart or explore other options. In my quest to resolve these issues, I've done my fair share of research, delving into tutorials and scouring various websites for potential solutions. I've even reached out to the person who built the PC for me, but unfortunately, none of the suggestions or advice provided have made a significant impact or revealed the underlying cause. I'm reaching out to this community in the hopes that some experienced individuals might shed some light on this matter. Has anyone faced a similar situation, and if so, how did you go about resolving it? I'm open to any guidance, suggestions, or troubleshooting steps that could help me get to the bottom of this persistent blue screen problem. Thank you in advance for your assistance!	1.0	t3_18ytf0a	reddit

I've wiped drives, fac reset windows, updated chipset drivers, deleted drivers reinstalled new ones, messed with all kinds of vsync settings, Reapplied thermal paste, added 2 new fans to the computer, the whole 9 miles of basically everything people mentioned on here and other places. Nothing has worked. Its more so annoying at this point as I wanna get this issue solved before I head back to college.

I thought It was Thermal Throttling at first but after trying some repairs it didnt do the trick. I should also mention I cannot undervolt or underclock my CPU/GPU because of my motherboard and CPU. I'm desperate for a fix at this point and do not wanna replace the computer as all of these are fairly new parts. Any advice on what it could be is much appreciated and I can answer any questions in the comments. Ill post a video again for reference on what my PC does while gaming aka the ""Microstutter"".

So I replaced the memory in one of my laptops and wasn't really paying attention as I was setting everything up and apparently I deleted something I wasn't supposed to. So now when I try to start it up to load an operating system it shows that one of the partitions has been deleted, if I try to refresh it shows that the drive is locked. I got my other laptop up and running just fine so I'm curious if I can just pull that nvme out, put it in the housing and then plug it into my other laptop and just reinitialize it. I've tried a few different fixes I found online but most of them are referring to a situation where your computer still boots up properly and then shows an issue. Mine boots up and then shows a light blue screen, not the blue screen of death, the windows blue error screen and then you hit escape and you can go to the boot menu, bios settings, system tests, all of that fun stuff, but I can't get past that point.	1.0	t3_18yj54v	reddit

When I went into the user folder directory the data remained despite me deleting it, as the user doesn’t exist anymore. I attempted to delete it and it gave me an error saying *assortment of numbers* needed to give you permission. Anyway I tried using mcafee shred feature and it worked in removing MOST of it but some still remain, with the same error. I did something stupid, and went into the properties menu and noticed two selections listed, one of which was the same assortment of numbers + account unknown the error had and I removed it from the properties list. I got a windows security warning saying I should reverse the action but I didn’t even realize exactly what I did, so I haven’t reversed it. Still can’t remove the user folder, for whats left of it. Currently in the properties menu it has; my main account, SYSTEM, system administrator, and another account unknown and an assortment of numbers, similar to the one I had initially removed. What I’m asking is what can I do to remove this user folder, I wanted to remove it initially because I was afraid there could be malware on it. I never downloaded anything sketchy but I visited a few websites and I had not gone into this in several weeks, but prior my computer would take a year to shut off after pressing shutdown and I think it only does this when I logged into that user. And as far as that goes, would I be better off doing a factory reset given that I messed with properties and stuff? I’m a bit afraid to do one because my computer came with nvidia graphics drivers and stuff(not preloaded though!) and I don’t know how to get them back after a factory reset. and for anything potentially complex relating to computer files and stuff PLEASE explain it to me like I’m a baby cause I don’t understand computer stuff much.

104	A Survey of Current Trends in Distributed, Grid and Cloud Computing	Gaurav Mittal	2013-08-08 10:23:09	http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1806v1	Through the 1990s to 2012 the internet changed the world of computing drastically. It started its journey with parallel computing after it advanced to distributed computing and further to grid computing. And in present scenario it creates a new world which is pronounced as a Cloud Computing [1]. These all three terms have different meanings. Cloud computing is based on backward computing schemes like cluster computing, distributed computing, grid computing and utility computing. The basic concept of cloud computing is virtualization. It provides virtual hardware and software resources to various requesting programs. This paper gives a detailed description about cluster computing, grid computing and cloud computing and gives an insight of some implementations of the same. We try to list the inspirations for the advent of all these technologies. We also account for some present scenario faults of grid computing and also discuss new cloud computing projects which are being managed by the Government of India for learning. The paper also reviews the existing work and covers (analytically), to some extent, some innovative ideas that can be implemented.			arxiv	['Dr. Nishtha Kesswani', 'Kuldeep Goswami']	4.0
105	Analysis on Computation-Intensive Status Update in Mobile Edge Computing	Qiaobin Kuang	2020-02-15 15:45:07	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06400v1	In status update scenarios, the freshness of information is measured in terms of age-of-information (AoI), which essentially reflects the timeliness for real-time applications to transmit status update messages to a remote controller. For some applications, computational expensive and time consuming data processing is inevitable for status information of messages to be displayed. Mobile edge servers are equipped with adequate computation resources and they are placed close to users. Thus, mobile edge computing (MEC) can be a promising technology to reduce AoI for computation-intensive messages. In this paper, we study the AoI for computation-intensive messages with MEC, and consider three computing schemes: local computing, remote computing at the MEC server, and partial computing, i.e., some part of computing tasks are performed locally, and the rest is executed at the MEC server. Zero-wait policy is adopted in all three schemes. Specifically, in local computing, a new message is generated immediately after the previous one is revealed by computing. While in remote computing and partial computing, a new message is generated once the previous one is received by the remote MEC server. With infinite queue size and exponentially distributed transmission time, closed-form average AoI for exponentially distributed computing time is derived for the three computing schemes. For deterministic computing time, the average AoI is analyzed numerically. Simulation results show that by carefully partitioning the computing tasks, the average AoI in partial computing is the smallest compared to local computing and remote computing. The results also indicate numerically the conditions on which remote computing attains smaller average AoI compared with local computing.			arxiv	['Jie Gong', 'Xiang Chen', 'Xiao Ma']	5.0
106	Computable structures on topological manifolds	Marcelo A. Aguilar	2017-03-12 06:14:21	http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04075v2	We propose a definition of computable manifold by introducing computability as a structure that we impose to a given topological manifold, just in the same way as differentiability or piecewise linearity are defined for smooth and PL manifolds respectively. Using the framework of computable topology and Type-2 theory of effectivity, we develop computable versions of all the basic concepts needed to define manifolds, like computable atlases and (computably) compatible computable atlases. We prove that given a computable atlas $\Phi$ defined on a set $M$, we can construct a computable topological space $(M, \tau_\Phi, \beta_\Phi, \nu_\Phi)$, where $\tau_\Phi$ is the topology on $M$ induced by $\Phi$ and that the equivalence class of this computable space characterizes the computable structure determined by $\Phi$. The concept of computable submanifold is also investigated. We show that any compact computable manifold which satisfies a computable version of the $T_2$-separation axiom, can be embedded as a computable submanifold of some euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{q}$, with a computable embedding, where $\mathbb{R}^{q}$ is equipped with its usual topology and some canonical computable encoding of all open rational balls.			arxiv	['Rodolfo Conde']	6.0

109	Turing machines can be efficiently simulated by the General Purpose Analog Computer	Amaury Pouly	2012-03-21 07:48:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4667v2	The Church-Turing thesis states that any sufficiently powerful computational model which captures the notion of algorithm is computationally equivalent to the Turing machine. This equivalence usually holds both at a computability level and at a computational complexity level modulo polynomial reductions. However, the situation is less clear in what concerns models of computation using real numbers, and no analog of the Church-Turing thesis exists for this case. Recently it was shown that some models of computation with real numbers were equivalent from a computability perspective. In particular it was shown that Shannon's General Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC) is equivalent to Computable Analysis. However, little is known about what happens at a computational complexity level. In this paper we shed some light on the connections between this two models, from a computational complexity level, by showing that, modulo polynomial reductions, computations of Turing machines can be simulated by GPACs, without the need of using more (space) resources than those used in the original Turing computation, as long as we are talking about bounded computations. In other words, computations done by the GPAC are as space-efficient as computations done in the context of Computable Analysis.			arxiv	['Olivier Bournez', 'Daniel S. Graça']	9.0

Future progress of new computational devices capable of dealing with problems of big data, internet of things, semantic web, cognitive robotics and neuroinformatics depends on the adequate models of computation. In this article we first present the current state of the art through systematization of existing models and mechanisms, and outline basic structural framework of computation. We argue that defining computation as information processing, and given that there is no information without (physical) representation, the dynamics of information on the fundamental level is physical/ intrinsic/ natural computation. As a special case, intrinsic computation is used for designed computation in computing machinery. Intrinsic natural computation occurs on variety of levels of physical processes, containing the levels of computation of living organisms (including highly intelligent animals) as well as designed computational devices. The present article offers a typology of current models of computation and indicates future paths for the advancement of the field; both by the development of new computational models and by learning from nature how to better compute using different mechanisms of intrinsic computation.			arxiv	['Gordana Dodig-Crnkovic']	10.0

The traditional network architecture cannot efficiently leverage these distributed computing power resources due to computing power island effect. To overcome these problems and improve network efficiency, a new network computing paradigm is proposed, i.e., Computing Power Network (CPN). Computing power network can connect ubiquitous and heterogenous computing power resources through networking to realize computing power scheduling flexibly. In this survey, we make an exhaustive review on the state-of-the-art research efforts on computing power network. We first give an overview of computing power network, including definition, architecture, and advantages. Next, a comprehensive elaboration of issues on computing power modeling, information awareness and announcement, resource allocation, network forwarding, computing power transaction platform and resource orchestration platform is presented. The computing power network testbed is built and evaluated. The applications and use cases in computing power network are discussed. Then, the key enabling technologies for computing power network are introduced. Finally, open challenges and future research directions are presented as well.			arxiv	['Bo Lei', 'Junlin Liu', 'Haonan Huang', 'Xing Zhang', 'Jing Peng', 'Wenbo Wang']	11.0
112	Duality and Recycling Computing in Quantum Computers	Gui Lu Long	2007-08-15 03:17:30	http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1986v1	Quantum computer possesses quantum parallelism and offers great computing power over classical computer \cite{er1,er2}. As is well-know, a moving quantum object passing through a double-slit exhibits particle wave duality. A quantum computer is static and lacks this duality property. The recently proposed duality computer has exploited this particle wave duality property, and it may offer additional computing power \cite{r1}. Simply put it, a duality computer is a moving quantum computer passing through a double-slit. A duality computer offers the capability to perform separate operations on the sub-waves coming out of the different slits, in the so-called duality parallelism. Here we show that an $n$-dubit duality computer can be modeled by an $(n+1)$-qubit quantum computer. In a duality mode, computing operations are not necessarily unitary. A $n$-qubit quantum computer can be used as an $n$-bit reversible classical computer and is energy efficient. Our result further enables a $(n+1)$-qubit quantum computer to run classical algorithms in a $O(2^n)$-bit classical computer. The duality mode provides a natural link between classical computing and quantum computing. Here we also propose a recycling computing mode in which a quantum computer will continue to compute until the result is obtained. These two modes provide new tool for algorithm design. A search algorithm for the unsorted database search problem is designed.			arxiv	['Yang Liu']	12.0

116	Finite Computational Structures and Implementations	Attila Egri-Nagy	2016-10-19 02:25:50	http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05849v1	What is computable with limited resources? How can we verify the correctness of computations? How to measure computational power with precision? Despite the immense scientific and engineering progress in computing, we still have only partial answers to these questions. In order to make these problems more precise, we describe an abstract algebraic definition of classical computation, generalizing traditional models to semigroups. The mathematical abstraction also allows the investigation of different computing paradigms (e.g. cellular automata, reversible computing) in the same framework. Here we summarize the main questions and recent results of the research of finite computation.			arxiv	[]	16.0

It unifies computational science (scientific computing) with intelligent extended reality and spatial computing for the medical field. It significantly extends previous Clinical XR, by integrating computational methods from neural simulation to computational geometry, computational vision and computer graphics up to theoretical computer science to solve hard problems in medicine and neuroscience: from low-code/no-code authoring medical XR platforms to deep learning systems for diagnostics, therapeutics, rehabilitation and from surgical planning to real-time operative navigation in XR.			arxiv	[]	17.0
118	Marvel DC: A Blockchain-Based Decentralized and Incentive-Compatible Distributed Computing Protocol	Conor McMenamin	2022-07-28 11:11:34	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14011v1	Decentralized computation outsourcing should allow anyone to access the large amounts of computational power that exists in the Internet of Things. Unfortunately, when trusted third parties are removed to achieve this decentralization, ensuring an outsourced computation is performed correctly remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we provide a solution to this problem. We outline Marvel DC, a fully decentralized blockchain-based distributed-computing protocol which formally guarantees that computers are strictly incentivized to correctly perform requested computations. Furthermore, Marvel DC utilizes a reputation management protocol to ensure that, for any minority of computers not performing calculations correctly, these computers are identified and selected for computations with diminishing probability. We then outline Privacy Marvel DC, a privacy-enhanced version of Marvel DC which decouples results from the computers which computed them, making the protocol suitable for computations such as Federated Learning, where results can reveal sensitive information about that computer that computed them. We provide an implementation of Marvel DC and analyses of both protocols, demonstrating that they are not only the first protocols to provide the aforementioned formal guarantees, but are also practical, competitive with prior attempts in the field, and ready to deploy.			arxiv	['Vanesa Daza']	18.0
119	Computing Offloading and Semantic Compression for Intelligent Computing Tasks in MEC Systems	Yuanpeng Zheng	2023-07-06 03:15:58	http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02747v1	This paper investigates the intelligent computing task-oriented computing offloading and semantic compression in mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. With the popularity of intelligent applications in various industries, terminals increasingly need to offload intelligent computing tasks with complex demands to MEC servers for computing, which is a great challenge for bandwidth and computing capacity allocation in MEC systems. Considering the accuracy requirement of intelligent computing tasks, we formulate an optimization problem of computing offloading and semantic compression. We jointly optimize the system utility which are represented as computing accuracy and task delay respectively to acquire the optimized system utility. To solve the proposed optimization problem, we decompose it into computing capacity allocation subproblem and compression offloading subproblem and obtain solutions through convex optimization and successive convex approximation. After that, the offloading decisions, computing capacity and compressed ratio are obtained in closed forms. We design the computing offloading and semantic compression algorithm for intelligent computing tasks in MEC systems then. Simulation results represent that our algorithm converges quickly and acquires better performance and resource utilization efficiency through the trend with total number of users and computing capacity compared with benchmarks.			arxiv	['Tiankui Zhang', 'Rong Huang', 'Yapeng Wang']	19.0

Quantum oracles may transmit phase information which is available to a quantum computer but not a classical computer. One consequence of this observation is that there is an oracle which is of no assistance to a classical computer but which allows a quantum computer to solve undecidable problems. Thus useful relativized separations between quantum and classical complexity classes must exclude the transmission of phase information from oracle to computer.			arxiv	[]	21.0

The first party's computational capabilities can be extremely limited: she must only be able to create and measure single-qubit superposition states. The second party is not required to use measurement-based quantum computation. The protocol requires the (optimal) exchange of O(J log(N)) single-qubit states, where J is the computational depth and N is the number of qubits needed for the computation.			arxiv	['Lorenzo Maccone', 'Tomoyuki Morimae', 'Terry G.

However, in some cases, if S has certain topological properties, we can conclude that S is computable. It is known that if a semi-computable set S is a compact manifold with boundary, then the computability of \deltaS implies the computability of S. In this paper we examine the case when S is a 1-manifold with boundary, not necessarily compact. We show that a similar result holds in this case under assumption that S has finitely many components.			arxiv	['Zvonko Iljazovic']	30.0

However, there is much that can be learned from traditional classical computer engineering. In this paper, we describe the Parallel Research Kernels (PRK), a tool that was very useful for designing classical parallel computing systems. The PRK are simple kernels written to expose bottlenecks that limit classical parallel computing performance. We hypothesize that an analogous tool for quantum computing, Quantum Research Kernels (QRK), may similarly aid the co-design of software and hardware for quantum computing systems, and we give a few examples of representative QRKs.			arxiv	['Timothy G.

138	A Galois connection between Turing jumps and limits	Vasco Brattka	2018-02-05 11:27:51	http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01355v3	Limit computable functions can be characterized by Turing jumps on the input side or limits on the output side. As a monad of this pair of adjoint operations we obtain a problem that characterizes the low functions and dually to this another problem that characterizes the functions that are computable relative to the halting problem. Correspondingly, these two classes are the largest classes of functions that can be pre or post composed to limit computable functions without leaving the class of limit computable functions. We transfer these observations to the lattice of represented spaces where it leads to a formal Galois connection. We also formulate a version of this result for computable metric spaces. Limit computability and computability relative to the halting problem are notions that coincide for points and sequences, but even restricted to continuous functions the former class is strictly larger than the latter. On computable metric spaces we can characterize the functions that are computable relative to the halting problem as those functions that are limit computable with a modulus of continuity that is computable relative to the halting problem. As a consequence of this result we obtain, for instance, that Lipschitz continuous functions that are limit computable are automatically computable relative to the halting problem. We also discuss 1-generic points as the canonical points of continuity of limit computable functions, and we prove that restricted to these points limit computable functions are computable relative to the halting problem. Finally, we demonstrate how these results can be applied in computable analysis.			arxiv	[]	38.0

There is a great deal of hype in this technology based area for that reason it is getting a great deal of attention of the computing community. Grid Computing makes use of clusters of PCs (personal computers), network servers or other computing technology-based systems. These systems are connecting jointly to deal with complex calculations, communication and collaboration. Grid Computing offers a great deal of support for offering corporations to make use of their idle computing power, or systems processing cycles, to produce a type of supercomputer arrangement. The technology of grid computing has newly transferred from customary high performance plus distributed technology based computing systems to utility and pervasive based computing arrangements. These technology-based structures are having superior potentials of the wireless networks communication and collaboration as well as having thin, lightweight and remotely accessible devices. This has as produced the establishment new computing technology paradigm known as Mobile Grid Computing. This research is going to assess and analyze the grid computing and mobile computing technology based arrangements. Here I will assess the feasibility analysis of the mobile grid computing. This research will analyze the mapping of grid computing techniques on the mobile domain. In this scenario, I will assess how can, we achieve grid architecture in mobile devices. For the sake of implementing a mobile gird arrangement, I will analyze the existing grid computing models and discuss the design, implementation, architecture and its limitations. This research will also highlight the effect of grid computing on mobiles load balancing, high processing efficiency and less network communication.			arxiv	[]	39.0

To overcome the limitations that restrict such applications, the development of a comprehensive computing paradigm has garnered attention in both academia and industry. However, a gap exists in the literature owing to the scarce research, and a comprehensive computing paradigm is yet to be systematically designed and reviewed. This study introduces a novel concept, called aerial computing, via the amalgamation of aerial radio access networks and edge computing, which attempts to bridge the gap. Specifically, first, we propose a novel comprehensive computing architecture that is composed of low-altitude computing, high-altitude computing, and satellite computing platforms, along with conventional computing systems. We determine that aerial computing offers several desirable attributes: global computing service, better mobility, higher scalability and availability, and simultaneity. Second, we comprehensively discuss key technologies that facilitate aerial computing, including energy refilling, edge computing, network softwarization, frequency spectrum, multi-access techniques, artificial intelligence, and big data. In addition, we discuss vertical domain applications (e.g., smart cities, smart vehicles, smart factories, and smart grids) supported by aerial computing. Finally, we highlight several challenges that need to be addressed and their possible solutions.			arxiv	['Rukhsana Ruby', 'Fang Fang', 'Dinh C.

We show that there exists a strictly increasing sequence of rational numbers that is nearly computably Cauchy and unbounded. Then we call a real number $\alpha$ nearly computable if there exists a computable sequence $(a_n)_n$ of rational numbers that converges to $\alpha$ and is nearly computably Cauchy. It is clear that every computable real number is nearly computable, and it follows from a result by Downey and LaForte (2002) that there exists a nearly computable and left-computable number that is not computable. We observe that the set of nearly computable real numbers is a real closed field and closed under computable real functions with open domain, but not closed under arbitrary computable real functions. Among other things we strengthen results by Hoyrup (2017) and by Stephan and Wu (2005) by showing that any nearly computable real number that is not computable is weakly $1$-generic (and, therefore, hyperimmune and not Martin-L\""of random) and strongly Kurtz random (and, therefore, not $K$-trivial), and we strengthen a result by Downey and LaForte (2002) by showing that no promptly simple set can be Turing reducible to a nearly computable real number."			arxiv	['Philip Janicki']	43.0
144	Quantum Computing Using Crossed Atomic Beams	P. Blythe	2006-05-22 10:54:05	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605190v2	A quantum computer is a hypothetical device in which the laws of quantum mechanics are used to introduce a degree of parallelism into computations and which could therefore significantly improve on the computational speed of a classical computer at certain tasks. Cluster state quantum computing (recently proposed by Raussendorf and Briegel) is a new paradigm in quantum information processing and is a departure from the conventional model of quantum computation. The cluster state quantum computer begins by creating a highly entangled multi-particle state (the cluster state) which it uses as a quantum resource during the computation. Information is processed in the computer via selected measurements on individual qubits that form the cluster state. We describe in detail how a scalable quantum computer can be constructed using microwave cavity QED and, in a departure from the traditional understanding of a computer as a fixed array of computational elements, we show that cluster state quantum computing is well suited to atomic beam experiments. We show that all of the necessary elements have been individually realised, and that the construction of a truly scalable atomic beam quantum computer may be an experimental reality in the near future.			arxiv	['B.

These observations capture various situations pertinent to people's needs and interests along with all their idiosyncrasies. To support human-centered computing that empower people in making better and timely decisions, we look towards computation that is inspired by human perception and cognition. Toward this goal, we discuss computing paradigms of semantic computing, cognitive computing, and an emerging aspect of computing, which we call perceptual computing. In our view, these offer a continuum to make the most out of vast, growing, and diverse data pertinent to human needs and interests. We propose details of perceptual computing characterized by interpretation and exploration operations comparable to the interleaving of bottom and top brain processing. This article consists of two parts. First we describe semantic computing, cognitive computing, and perceptual computing to lay out distinctions while acknowledging their complementary capabilities. We then provide a conceptual overview of the newest of these three paradigms--perceptual computing. For further insights, we focus on an application scenario of asthma management converting massive, heterogeneous and multimodal (big) data into actionable information or smart data.			arxiv	['Pramod Anantharam', 'Cory Henson']	45.0
146	How Far Can We Go in Compute-less Networking: Computation Correctness and Accuracy	Boubakr Nour	2021-03-29 19:57:16	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15924v2	Emerging applications such as augmented reality and tactile Internet are compute-intensive and latency-sensitive, which hampers their running in constrained end devices alone or in the distant cloud. The stringent requirements of such application drove to the realization of Edge computing in which computation is offloaded near to users. Compute-less networking is an extension of edge computing that aims at reducing computation and abridging communication by adopting in-network computing and computation reuse. Computation reuse aims to cache the result of computations and use them to perform similar tasks in the future and, therefore, avoid redundant calculations and optimize the use of resources. In this paper, we focus on the correctness of the final output produced by computation reuse. Since the input might not be identical but similar, the reuse of previous computation raises questions about the accuracy of the final results. To this end, we implement a proof of concept to study and gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of computation reuse. We are able to reduce task completion time by up to 80% while ensuring high correctness. We further discuss open challenges and highlight future research directions.			arxiv	['Soumaya Cherkaoui']	46.0

Current computing mechanism is effective, particular for medium and small cloud based companies, in which it permits easy and reliable access to cloud services like infrastructure, software and platform. Present cloud computing is almost similar to the existing models: cluster computing and grid computing. The important key technical features of cloud computing which includes autonomic service, rapid elasticity, end-to-end virtualization support, on-demand resource pooling and transparency in cloud billing. Further, non-technical features of cloud computing includes environment friendliness, little maintenance overhead, lower upfront costs, faster time to deployments, Service Level Agreement (SLA) and pay-as-you-go-model. In distributed computing environment, unpredictability of service is a fact, so same possible in cloud also. The success of next-generation Cloud Computing infrastructures will depend on how capably these infrastructures will discover and dynamically tolerate computing platforms, which meet randomly varying resource and service requirements of Cloud costumer applications.			arxiv	[]	47.0
148	The Case for the Anonymization of Offloaded Computation	Md Washik Al Azad	2023-05-12 23:49:06	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07803v1	Computation offloading (often to external computing resources over a network) has become a necessity for modern applications. At the same time, the proliferation of machine learning techniques has empowered malicious actors to use such techniques in order to breach the privacy of the execution process for offloaded computations. This can enable malicious actors to identify offloaded computations and infer their nature based on computation characteristics that they may have access to even if they do not have direct access to the computation code. In this paper, we first demonstrate that even non-sophisticated machine learning algorithms can accurately identify offloaded computations. We then explore the design space of anonymizing offloaded computations through the realization of a framework, called Camouflage. Camouflage features practical mechanisms to conceal characteristics related to the execution of computations, which can be used by malicious actors to identify computations and orchestrate further attacks based on identified computations. Our evaluation demonstrated that Camouflage can impede the ability of malicious actors to identify executed computations by up to 60%, while incurring modest overheads for the anonymization of computations.			arxiv	['Shifat Sarwar', 'Sifat Ut Taki', 'Spyridon Mastorakis']	48.0
149	The Marriage of Incremental and Approximate Computing	Dhanya R Krishnan	2016-11-25 20:05:08	http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08573v1	Most data analytics systems that require low-latency execution and efficient utilization of computing resources, increasingly adopt two computational paradigms, namely, incremental and approximate computing. Incremental computation updates the output incrementally instead of re-computing everything from scratch for successive runs of a job with input changes. Approximate computation returns an approximate output for a job instead of the exact output. Both paradigms rely on computing over a subset of data items instead of computing over the entire dataset, but they differ in their means for skipping parts of the computation. Incremental computing relies on the memoization of intermediate results of sub-computations, and reusing these memoized results across jobs for sub-computations that are unaffected by the changed input. Approximate computing relies on representative sampling of the entire dataset to compute over a subset of data items. In this thesis, we make the observation that these two computing paradigms are complementary, and can be married together! The high level idea is to: design a sampling algorithm that biases the sample selection to the memoized data items from previous runs. To concretize this idea, we designed an online stratified sampling algorithm that uses self-adjusting computation to produce an incrementally updated approximate output with bounded error. We implemented our algorithm in a data analytics system called IncAppox based on Apache Spark Streaming. Our evaluation of the system shows that IncApprox achieves the benefits of both incremental and approximate computing.			arxiv	[]	49.0

It is essential for real-time applications to transmit status update packets to the destination node as timely as possible. However, for some applications, status information embedded in the packets is not revealed until complicated data processing, which is computational expensive and time consuming. As mobile edge server has sufficient computational resource and is placed close to users, mobile edge computing (MEC) is expected to reduce age for computation-intensive messages. In this paper, we study the AoI for computation-intensive data in MEC, and consider two schemes: local computing by user itself and remote computing at MEC server. The two computing models are unified into a two-node tandem queuing model. Zero-wait policy is adopted, i.e., a new message is generated once the previous one leaves the first node. We consider exponentially distributed service time and infinite queue size, and hence, the second node can be seen as a First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) M/M/1 system. Closed-form average AoI is derived for the two computing schemes. The region where remote computing outperforms local computing is characterized. Simulation results show that the remote computing is greatly superior to the local computing when the remote computing rate is large enough, and that there exists an optimal transmission rate so that remote computing is better than local computing for a largest range.			arxiv	['Jie Gong', 'Xiang Chen', 'Xiao Ma']	50.0
151	Neuromorphic Computing is Turing-Complete	Prasanna Date	2021-04-28 19:25:01	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13983v1	Neuromorphic computing is a non-von Neumann computing paradigm that performs computation by emulating the human brain. Neuromorphic systems are extremely energy-efficient and known to consume thousands of times less power than CPUs and GPUs. They have the potential to drive critical use cases such as autonomous vehicles, edge computing and internet of things in the future. For this reason, they are sought to be an indispensable part of the future computing landscape. Neuromorphic systems are mainly used for spike-based machine learning applications, although there are some non-machine learning applications in graph theory, differential equations, and spike-based simulations. These applications suggest that neuromorphic computing might be capable of general-purpose computing. However, general-purpose computability of neuromorphic computing has not been established yet. In this work, we prove that neuromorphic computing is Turing-complete and therefore capable of general-purpose computing. Specifically, we present a model of neuromorphic computing, with just two neuron parameters (threshold and leak), and two synaptic parameters (weight and delay). We devise neuromorphic circuits for computing all the {\mu}-recursive functions (i.e., constant, successor and projection functions) and all the {\mu}-recursive operators (i.e., composition, primitive recursion and minimization operators). Given that the {\mu}-recursive functions and operators are precisely the ones that can be computed using a Turing machine, this work establishes the Turing-completeness of neuromorphic computing.			arxiv	['Catherine Schuman', 'Bill Kay', 'Thomas Potok']	51.0
152	Intelligent Computing: The Latest Advances, Challenges and Future	Shiqiang Zhu	2022-11-21 09:15:13	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11281v1	Computing is a critical driving force in the development of human civilization. In recent years, we have witnessed the emergence of intelligent computing, a new computing paradigm that is reshaping traditional computing and promoting digital revolution in the era of big data, artificial intelligence and internet-of-things with new computing theories, architectures, methods, systems, and applications. Intelligent computing has greatly broadened the scope of computing, extending it from traditional computing on data to increasingly diverse computing paradigms such as perceptual intelligence, cognitive intelligence, autonomous intelligence, and human-computer fusion intelligence. Intelligence and computing have undergone paths of different evolution and development for a long time but have become increasingly intertwined in recent years: intelligent computing is not only intelligence-oriented but also intelligence-driven. Such cross-fertilization has prompted the emergence and rapid advancement of intelligent computing. Intelligent computing is still in its infancy and an abundance of innovations in the theories, systems, and applications of intelligent computing are expected to occur soon. We present the first comprehensive survey of literature on intelligent computing, covering its theory fundamentals, the technological fusion of intelligence and computing, important applications, challenges, and future perspectives. We believe that this survey is highly timely and will provide a comprehensive reference and cast valuable insights into intelligent computing for academic and industrial researchers and practitioners.			arxiv	['Ting Yu', 'Tao Xu', 'Hongyang Chen', 'Schahram Dustdar', 'Sylvain Gigan', 'Deniz Gunduz', 'Ekram Hossain', 'Yaochu Jin', 'Feng Lin', 'Bo Liu', 'Zhiguo Wan', 'Ji Zhang', 'Zhifeng Zhao', 'Wentao Zhu', 'Zuoning Chen', 'Tariq Durrani', 'Huaimin Wang', 'Jiangxing Wu', 'Tongyi Zhang', 'Yunhe Pan']	53.0
153	Energy-Consumption Advantage of Quantum Computation	Florian Meier	2023-05-18 18:00:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11212v2	Energy consumption in solving computational problems has been gaining growing attention as a part of the performance measures of computers. Quantum computation is known to offer advantages over classical computation in terms of various computational resources; however, its advantage in energy consumption has been challenging to analyze due to the lack of a theoretical foundation to relate the physical notion of energy and the computer-scientific notion of complexity for quantum computation with finite computational resources. To bridge this gap, we introduce a general framework for studying the energy consumption of quantum and classical computation based on a computational model that has been conventionally used for studying query complexity in computational complexity theory. With this framework, we derive an upper bound for the achievable energy consumption of quantum computation. We also develop techniques for proving a nonzero lower bound of energy consumption of classical computation based on the energy-conservation law and Landauer's principle. With these general bounds, we rigorously prove that quantum computation achieves an exponential energy-consumption advantage over classical computation for solving a specific computational problem, Simon's problem. Furthermore, we clarify how to demonstrate this energy-consumption advantage of quantum computation in an experimental setting. These results provide a fundamental framework and techniques to explore the physical meaning of quantum advantage in the query-complexity setting based on energy consumption, opening an alternative way to study the advantages of quantum computation.			arxiv	['Hayata Yamasaki']	54.0

Examples of such models are cellular automata, spatial computation and space-time crystallography. For any computational model it is natural to define a functional equivalence of different but related computational structures. In the finite automata theory an example of such equivalence is automata homomorphism and, in particular, automata isomorphism. If we continue to stick to the finite automata theory, a fundamental question arise, what a state of a distributed computational structure is. This work is devoted to particular solution of the issue.			arxiv	[]	59.0

However, due to limitations in scalability of quantum technologies, it seems that we are far from constructing universal quantum computers for everyday users. A more feasible solution is the delegation of computation to powerful quantum servers on the network. This solution was proposed in previous studies of Blind Quantum Computation, with guarantees for both the secrecy of the input and of the computation being performed.

In this work, we explore a new computation scheme, in which the linear operators in quantum computing are replaced by (higher) functors between two (higher) categories. If from Turing computing to quantum computing is the first quantization of computation, then this new scheme can be viewed as the second quantization of computation.

We propose successive approximation coding (SAC) techniques that realize a tradeoff between accuracy and speed, allowing the distributed computing system to produce approximations that increase in accuracy over time. If a sufficient number of compute nodes finish their tasks, SAC exactly recovers the desired computation. We theoretically provide design guidelines for our SAC techniques, and numerically show that SAC achieves a better accuracy-speed tradeoff in comparison with previous methods.			arxiv	['Stark C.

The quantum field computation model contains the quantum computation model of Feynman. (The term ""quantum field computer"" was used by Freedman.) Quantum field computation (as enhanced by Wightman's model of quantum field theory) involves computation over the continuum which is remarkably related to the real computation model of Smale. The latter model was established as a generalization of Turing computation. All this is not surprising since it is well known that the physics of quantum field theory (which includes Einstein's special relativity) contains quantum mechanics which in turn contains classical mechanics. The unity of these computing models, which seem to have grown largely independently, could shed new light into questions of computational complexity, into the central P (Polynomial time) versus NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial time) problem of computer science, and also into the description of Nature by fundamental physics theories."			arxiv	[]	78.0

178	Point-Separable Classes of Simple Computable Planar Curves	Xizhong Zheng	2012-08-08 21:34:33	http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2245v2	In mathematics curves are typically defined as the images of continuous real functions (parametrizations) defined on a closed interval. They can also be defined as connected one-dimensional compact subsets of points. For simple curves of finite lengths, parametrizations can be further required to be injective or even length-normalized. All of these four approaches to curves are classically equivalent. In this paper we investigate four different versions of computable curves based on these four approaches. It turns out that they are all different, and hence, we get four different classes of computable curves. More interestingly, these four classes are even point-separable in the sense that the sets of points covered by computable curves of different versions are also different. However, if we consider only computable curves of computable lengths, then all four versions of computable curves become equivalent. This shows that the definition of computable curves is robust, at least for those of computable lengths. In addition, we show that the class of computable curves of computable lengths is point-separable from the other four classes of computable curves.			arxiv	['Robert Rettinger']	80.0
179	Computing in matrix groups without memory	Peter J. Cameron	2013-10-22 18:47:12	http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6009v1	Memoryless computation is a novel means of computing any function of a set of registers by updating one register at a time while using no memory. We aim to emulate how computations are performed on modern cores, since they typically involve updates of single registers. The computation model of memoryless computation can be fully expressed in terms of transformation semigroups, or in the case of bijective functions, permutation groups. In this paper, we view registers as elements of a finite field and we compute linear permutations without memory. We first determine the maximum complexity of a linear function when only linear instructions are allowed. We also determine which linear functions are hardest to compute when the field in question is the binary field and the number of registers is even. Secondly, we investigate some matrix groups, thus showing that the special linear group is internally computable but not fast. Thirdly, we determine the smallest set of instructions required to generate the special and general linear groups. These results are important for memoryless computation, for they show that linear functions can be computed very fast or that very few instructions are needed to compute any linear function. They thus indicate new advantages of using memoryless computation.			arxiv	['Ben Fairbairn', 'Maximilien Gadouleau']	81.0

Coded computation techniques leverage coding theory to inject computational redundancy and mitigate stragglers in distributed computations. In this paper, we propose a dynamic workload distribution strategy for coded computation called Slack Squeeze Coded Computation ($S^2C^2$). $S^2C^2$ squeezes the compute slack (i.e., overhead) that is built into the coded computing frameworks by efficiently assigning work for all fast and slow nodes according to their speeds and without needing to re-distribute data. We implement an LSTM-based speed prediction algorithm to predict speeds of compute nodes. We evaluate $S^2C^2$ on linear algebraic algorithms, gradient descent, graph ranking, and graph filtering algorithms. We demonstrate 19% to 39% reduction in total computation latency using $S^2C^2$ compared to job replication and coded computation. We further show how $S^2C^2$ can be applied beyond matrix-vector multiplication.			arxiv	['Zhifeng Lin', 'Mehrdad Kiamari', 'Salman Avestimehr', 'Murali Annavaram']	83.0
182	Quantum-Inspired Computing: Can it be a Microscopic Computing Model of the Brain?	Yasunao Katayama	2019-04-11 01:12:23	http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10508v2	Quantum computing and the workings of the brain have many aspects in common and have been attracting increasing attention in academia and industry. The computation in both is parallel and non-discrete. Though the underlying physical dynamics (e.g., equation of motion) may be deterministic, the observed or interpreted outcomes are often probabilistic. Consequently, various investigations have been undertaken to understand and reproduce the brain on the basis of quantum physics and computing. However, there have been arguments on whether the brain can and have to take advantage of quantum phenomena that need to survive in the macroscopic space-time region at room temperature. This paper presents a unique microscopic computational model for the brain based on an ansatz that the brain computes in a manner similar to quantum computing, but with classical waves. Log-scale encoding of information in the context of computing with waves is shown to play a critical role in bridging the computing models with classical and quantum waves. Our quantum-inspired computing model opens up a possibility of unifying the computing framework of artificial intelligence and quantum computing beyond quantum machine learning approaches.			arxiv	[]	84.0

The need for more performant, comfortable and safe computing forced to develop and utilize several tricks both in hardware and software. Till now technology enabled to increase performance without changing the basic computing paradigms. The recent stalling of single-threaded computing performance, however, requires to redesign computing to be able to provide the expected performance. To do so, the computing paradigms themselves must be scrutinized. The limitations caused by the too restrictive interpretation of the computing paradigms are demonstrated, an extended computing paradigm introduced, ideas about changing elements of the computing stack suggested, some implementation details of both hardware and software discussed. The resulting new computing stack offers considerably higher computing throughput, simplified hardware architecture, drastically improved real-time behavior and in general, simplified and more efficient computing stack.			arxiv	[]	85.0

Next to researchers and vendors of future computing technologies, national authorities are showing strong interest in maturing this technology due to its known potential to break many of today's encryption techniques, which would have significant impact on our society. It is however quite likely that quantum computing has beneficial impact on many computational disciplines. In this article we describe our vision of future developments in scientific computing that would be enabled by the advent of software-programmable quantum computers. We thereby assume that quantum computers will form part of a hybrid accelerated computing platform like GPUs and co-processor cards do today. In particular, we address the potential of quantum algorithms to bring major breakthroughs in applied mathematics and its applications. Finally, we give several examples that demonstrate the possible impact of quantum-accelerated scientific computing on society.			arxiv	['Cornelis Vuik']	86.0
185	Proof-of-work certificates that can be efficiently computed in the cloud	Jean-Guillaume Dumas	2018-06-29 08:13:29	http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11293v2	In an emerging computing paradigm, computational capabilities, from processing power to storage capacities, are offered to users over communication networks as a cloud-based service. There, demanding computations are outsourced in order to limit infrastructure costs. The idea of verifiable computing is to associate a data structure, a proof-of-work certificate, to the result of the outsourced computation. This allows a verification algorithm to prove the validity of the result, faster than by recomputing it. We talk about a Prover (the server performing the computations) and a Verifier. Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum gave in 2008 a generic method to verify any parallelizable computation, in almost linear time in the size of the, potentially structured, inputs and the result. However, the extra cost of the computations for the Prover (and therefore the extra cost to the customer), although only almost a constant factor of the overall work, is nonetheless prohibitive in practice. Differently, we will here present problem-specific procedures in computer algebra, e.g. for exact linear algebra computations, that are Prover-optimal, that is that have much less financial overhead.			arxiv	[]	87.0
186	Computation Efficiency Maximization in Wireless-Powered Mobile Edge Computing Networks	Fuhui Zhou	2020-01-28 09:50:18	http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10234v2	Energy-efficient computation is an inevitable trend for mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. Resource allocation strategies for maximizing the computation efficiency are critically important. In this paper, computation efficiency maximization problems are formulated in wireless-powered MEC networks under both partial and binary computation offloading modes. A practical non-linear energy harvesting model is considered. Both time division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are considered and evaluated for offloading. The energy harvesting time, the local computing frequency, and the offloading time and power are jointly optimized to maximize the computation efficiency under the max-min fairness criterion. Two iterative algorithms and two alternative optimization algorithms are respectively proposed to address the non-convex problems formulated in this paper. Simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation schemes outperform the benchmark schemes in terms of user fairness. Moreover, a tradeoff is elucidated between the achievable computation efficiency and the total number of computed bits. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate that the partial computation offloading mode outperforms the binary computation offloading mode and NOMA outperforms TDMA in terms of computation efficiency.			arxiv	['Rose Qingyang Hu']	88.0
187	Controlling Computation versus Quality for Neural Sequence Models	Ankur Bapna	2020-02-17 17:54:27	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07106v2	Most neural networks utilize the same amount of compute for every example independent of the inherent complexity of the input. Further, methods that adapt the amount of computation to the example focus on finding a fixed inference-time computational graph per example, ignoring any external computational budgets or varying inference time limitations. In this work, we utilize conditional computation to make neural sequence models (Transformer) more efficient and computation-aware during inference. We first modify the Transformer architecture, making each set of operations conditionally executable depending on the output of a learned control network. We then train this model in a multi-task setting, where each task corresponds to a particular computation budget. This allows us to train a single model that can be controlled to operate on different points of the computation-quality trade-off curve, depending on the available computation budget at inference time. We evaluate our approach on two tasks: (i) WMT English-French Translation and (ii) Unsupervised representation learning (BERT). Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed Conditional Computation Transformer (CCT) is competitive with vanilla Transformers when allowed to utilize its full computational budget, while improving significantly over computationally equivalent baselines when operating on smaller computational budgets.			arxiv	['Naveen Arivazhagan', 'Orhan Firat']	89.0
188	Analog Computation and Representation	Corey J. Maley	2020-12-10 20:44:48	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05965v1	Relative to digital computation, analog computation has been neglected in the philosophical literature. To the extent that attention has been paid to analog computation, it has been misunderstood. The received view -- that analog computation has to do essentially with continuity -- is simply wrong, as shown by careful attention to historical examples of discontinuous, discrete analog computers. Instead of the received view, I develop an account of analog computation in terms of a particular type of analog representation that allows for discontinuity. This account thus characterizes all types of analog computation, whether continuous or discrete. Furthermore, the structure of this account can be generalized to other types of computation: analog computation essentially involves analog representation, whereas digital computation essentially involves digital representation. Besides being a necessary component of a complete philosophical understanding of computation in general, understanding analog computation is important for computational explanation in contemporary neuroscience and cognitive science.			arxiv	[]	90.0
189	Consideration of the Need for Quantum Grid Computing	Dominic Rosch-Grace	2021-06-21 18:19:22	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11341v1	Quantum computing is poised to dramatically change the computational landscape, worldwide. Quantum computers can solve complex problems that are, at least in some cases, beyond the ability of even advanced future classical-style computers. In addition to being able to solve these classical computer-unsolvable problems, quantum computers have demonstrated a capability to solve some problems (such as prime factoring) much more efficiently than classical computing. This will create problems for encryption techniques, which depend on the difficulty of factoring for their security. Security, scientific, and other applications will require access to quantum computing resources to access their unique capabilities, speed and economic (aggregate computing time cost) benefits. Many scientific applications, as well as numerous other ones, use grid computing to provide benefits such as scalability and resource access. As these applications may benefit from quantum capabilities - and some future applications may require quantum capabilities - identifying how to integrate quantum computing systems into grid computing environments is critical. This paper discusses the benefits of grid-connected quantum computers and what is required to achieve this.			arxiv	['Jeremy Straub']	91.0
190	Molecular Dynamics Simulations on Cloud Computing and Machine Learning Platforms	Prateek Sharma	2021-11-11 21:20:26	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06466v1	"Scientific computing applications have benefited greatly from high performance computing infrastructure such as supercomputers. However, we are seeing a paradigm shift in the computational structure, design, and requirements of these applications. Increasingly, data-driven and machine learning approaches are being used to support, speed-up, and enhance scientific computing applications, especially molecular dynamics simulations. Concurrently, cloud computing platforms are increasingly appealing for scientific computing, providing ""infinite"" computing powers, easier programming and deployment models, and access to computing accelerators such as TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). This confluence of machine learning (ML) and cloud computing represents exciting opportunities for cloud and systems researchers. ML-assisted molecular dynamics simulations are a new class of workload, and exhibit unique computational patterns. These simulations present new challenges for low-cost and high-performance execution. We argue that transient cloud resources, such as low-cost preemptible cloud VMs, can be a viable platform for this new workload. Finally, we present some low-hanging fruits and long-term challenges in cloud resource management, and the integration of molecular dynamics simulations into ML platforms (such as TensorFlow)."			arxiv	['Vikram Jadhao']	92.0
191	Age of Information of Multi-user Mobile Edge Computing Systems	Zhifeng Tang	2022-11-02 04:43:42	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00874v1	In this paper, we analyze the average age of information (AoI) and the average peak AoI (PAoI) of a multiuser mobile edge computing (MEC) system where a base station (BS) generates and transmits computation-intensive packets to user equipments (UEs). In this MEC system, we focus on three computing schemes: (i) The local computing scheme where all computational tasks are computed by the local server at the UE, (ii) The edge computing scheme where all computational tasks are computed by the edge server at the BS, and (iii) The partial computing scheme where computational tasks are partially allocated at the edge server and the rest are computed by the local server. Considering exponentially distributed transmission time and computation time and adopting the first come first serve (FCFS) queuing policy, we derive closed-form expressions for the average AoI and average PAoI. To address the complexity of the average AoI expression, we derive simple upper and lower bounds on the average AoI, which allow us to explicitly examine the dependence of the optimal offloading decision on the MEC system parameters. Aided by simulation results, we verify our analysis and illustrate the impact of system parameters on the AoI performance.			arxiv	['Zhuo Sun', 'Nan Yang', 'Xiangyun Zhou']	93.0
192	Computation Environments, An Interactive Semantics for Turing Machines (which P is not equal to NP considering it)	Rasoul Ramezanian	2012-05-27 19:21:03	http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5994v1	To scrutinize notions of computation and time complexity, we introduce and formally define an interactive model for computation that we call it the \emph{computation environment}. A computation environment consists of two main parts: i) a universal processor and ii) a computist who uses the computability power of the universal processor to perform effective procedures. The notion of computation finds it meaning, for the computist, through his \underline{interaction} with the universal processor. We are interested in those computation environments which can be considered as alternative for the real computation environment that the human being is its computist. These computation environments must have two properties: 1- being physically plausible, and 2- being enough powerful. Based on Copeland' criteria for effective procedures, we define what a \emph{physically plausible} computation environment is. We construct two \emph{physically plausible} and \emph{enough powerful} computation environments: 1- the Turing computation environment, denoted by $E_T$, and 2- a persistently evolutionary computation environment, denoted by $E_e$, which persistently evolve in the course of executing the computations. We prove that the equality of complexity classes $\mathrm{P}$ and $\mathrm{NP}$ in the computation environment $E_e$ conflicts with the \underline{free will} of the computist. We provide an axiomatic system $\mathcal{T}$ for Turing computability and prove that ignoring just one of the axiom of $\mathcal{T}$, it would not be possible to derive $\mathrm{P=NP}$ from the rest of axioms. We prove that the computist who lives inside the environment $E_T$, can never be confident that whether he lives in a static environment or a persistently evolutionary one.			arxiv	[]	94.0
193	Aqua Computing: Coupling Computing and Communications	Chathura Sarathchandra Magurawalage	2015-10-25 14:27:22	http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07250v1	The authors introduce a new vision for providing computing services for connected devices. It is based on the key concept that future computing resources will be coupled with communication resources, for enhancing user experience of the connected users, and also for optimising resources in the providers' infrastructures. Such coupling is achieved by Joint/Cooperative resource allocation algorithms, by integrating computing and communication services and by integrating hardware in networks. Such type of computing, by which computing services are not delivered independently but dependent of networking services, is named Aqua Computing. The authors see Aqua Computing as a novel approach for delivering computing resources to end devices, where computing power of the devices are enhanced automatically once they are connected to an Aqua Computing enabled network. The process of resource coupling is named computation dissolving. Then, an Aqua Computing architecture is proposed for mobile edge networks, in which computing and wireless networking resources are allocated jointly or cooperatively by a Mobile Cloud Controller, for the benefit of the end-users and/or for the benefit of the service providers. Finally, a working prototype of the system is shown and the gathered results show the performance of the Aqua Computing prototype.			arxiv	['Kun Yang', 'Kezhi Wang']	95.0
194	When does a physical system compute?	Dominic Horsman	2013-09-30 19:37:43	http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7979v3	Computing is a high-level process of a physical system. Recent interest in non-standard computing systems, including quantum and biological computers, has brought this physical basis of computing to the forefront. There has been, however, no consensus on how to tell if a given physical system is acting as a computer or not; leading to confusion over novel computational devices, and even claims that every physical event is a computation. In this paper we introduce a formal framework that can be used to determine whether or not a physical system is performing a computation. We demonstrate how the abstract computational level interacts with the physical device level, drawing the comparison with the use of mathematical models to represent physical objects in experimental science. This powerful formulation allows a precise description of the similarities between experiments, computation, simulation, and technology, leading to our central conclusion: physical computing is the use of a physical system to predict the outcome of an abstract evolution. We give conditions that must be satisfied in order for computation to be occurring, and illustrate these with a range of non-standard computing scenarios. The framework also covers broader computing contexts, where there is no obvious human computer user. We define the critical notion of a 'computational entity', and show the role this plays in defining when computing is taking place in physical systems.			arxiv	['Susan Stepney', 'Rob C.

195	"Exploring the landscapes of ""computing"": digital, neuromorphic, unconventional -- and beyond"	Herbert Jaeger	2020-11-24 10:37:11	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12013v3	"The acceleration race of digital computing technologies seems to be steering toward impasses -- technological, economical and environmental -- a condition that has spurred research efforts in alternative, ""neuromorphic"" (brain-like) computing technologies. Furthermore, since decades the idea of exploiting nonlinear physical phenomena ""directly"" for non-digital computing has been explored under names like ""unconventional computing"", ""natural computing"", ""physical computing"", or ""in-materio computing"". This has been taking place in niches which are small compared to other sectors of computer science. In this paper I stake out the grounds of how a general concept of ""computing"" can be developed which comprises digital, neuromorphic, unconventional and possible future ""computing"" paradigms. The main contribution of this paper is a wide-scope survey of existing formal conceptualizations of ""computing"". The survey inspects approaches rooted in three different kinds of background mathematics: discrete-symbolic formalisms, probabilistic modeling, and dynamical-systems oriented views. It turns out that different choices of background mathematics lead to decisively different understandings of what ""computing"" is. Across all of this diversity, a unifying coordinate system for theorizing about ""computing"" can be distilled. Within these coordinates I locate anchor points for a foundational formal theory of a future computing-engineering discipline that includes, but will reach beyond, digital and neuromorphic computing."			arxiv	[]	97.0
